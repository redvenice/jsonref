Whereupon Britannia\u0027s captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests. Rules were rules. The Yacht would have to pack up and go.It was only after the direct intervention of the White House that Britannia was allowed to remain alongside. The banquet duly took place without further incident. The fabled \u0027special relationship\u0027 had worked its magic once again.It\u0027s a phrase, however, which is heard more often on this side of the Atlantic and there are commentators in both Britain and the U.S. who regard any notion of a \u0027special relationship\u0027 as sentimental, subservient wishful thinking on the part of the British Establishment.There have certainly been some strong inidual pairings between No 10 and the White House, notably Churchill and Roosevelt, Thatcher and Reagan and, latterly, Blair and George W. Bush.          Queen Elizabeth II rides on horseback with American President Ronald Reagan in Windsor, June 1982However, historians will note that there has been a more subtle, yet more consistent, \u0027special relationship\u0027 operating between the White House and Buckingham Palace throughout the reign of Elizabeth II — even during periods of deep political ision.Unlike the Queen\u0027s dealings with most countries, which have followed a well-established pattern, this is a friendship that has broken the bilateral mould. There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen\u0027s own \u0027special relationship\u0027 goes back to the nursery.It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: \u0027All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans \u0026amp HOT DOGS too!\u0027While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America\u0027s entry into the war.          Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power DamCome victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947 People Will Say We\u0027re in Love has been one of \u0027their\u0027 songs ever since.The Queen\u0027s first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket.           Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman \u0027How nice you can bring your children along,\u0027 she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for \u0027her\u0027 scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the \u0027special relationship\u0027 on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen\u0027s advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.\u0027One plants one\u0027s feet like this,\u0027 the Queen told her. \u0027Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That\u0027s all there is to it.\u0027The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain \u0026amp Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.There was an even more awkward moment when Ford\u0027s successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — \u0027Miz Lillian\u0027 — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. \u0027I took a sharp step backwards,\u0027 she recalled, \u0027not far enough.\u0027Carter\u0027s successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime\u0027s ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.\u0027Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,\u0027 recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. \u0027Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn\u0027t sort it out so he said: \u0027Why don\u0027t we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?\u0027 \u0027The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.          Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower\u0027I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews\u0027s husband,\u0027 Sir Brian recalls. \u0027He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.\u0027A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.\u0027The next question was: where to go for dinner?\u0027 remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco\u0027s most famous restaurant, Trader Vic\u0027s, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).The \u0027special relationship\u0027 was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush\u0027s formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.‘It’s satire, if you don’t like it you don’t have to read...Brits with less than six months on their passport could face...Share this article He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC\u0027s Jim Miklaszewski: \u0027She\u0027s gone! All I got is a talking hat!\u0027 To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as \u0027the talking hat tour\u0027.D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President\u0027s son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be \u0027mercurial\u0027.The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words \u0027God Save The Queen\u0027. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.\u0027I guess so,\u0027 replied Bush Junior.\u0027All families have them,\u0027 observed the Queen.\u0027Who\u0027s yours?\u0027 Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: \u0027Don\u0027t answer that!\u0027Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the \u0027special relationship\u0027.The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen\u0027s guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.

However, it was Andrew Parker Bowles whom the Prince should have been most grateful to see.The 40-year-old Army officer had taken it upon himself to double-check every section of the royal itinerary.This included a trip to the Henderson Veterinary Research Station at Mazowe, where the vets were so convinced that they had found a way to tame the notoriously irascible African buffalo, a creature responsible for at least 200 deaths each year, that they were going to invite the Prince to ride one.          Mr Parker Bowles, earlier this monthFortunately for Prince Charles, the gallant Lieutenant Colonel decided to test-ride a buffalo himself, only to be thrown off and gored through the right thigh. A few inches further up and he would have been killed. The royal riding trip at Mazowe was now off. Had the Prince followed the Foreign Office plan, though, he would have been in grave danger. \u0027I always remind him that if it hadn\u0027t gored me and had gored him, things might be very different these days,\u0027 laughs Brigadier Parker Bowles.\u0027He gives me a wry smile and, rightly, takes it quite lightly.\u0027                                                    Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.

As a result of showing contrition after being arrested and charged, he is set to keep his captaincy.           The footballer was met by a scrum of photographers who surrounded the Frenchman          His club said the drink driving charge would be taken \u0027extremely seriously\u0027 and dealt with internallyOutlining the case, prosecutor Mr Fitch said: \u0027Shortly before 2.20am, officers were on patrol in an unmarked vehicle when their attention was drawn to a Porsche - it was moving strangely and doing 15mph in a 30mph zone.\u0027It veered a number of times towards parked vehicles, nearly clipping them, before correcting itself. It then went through a red light.\u0027Defence counsel Mr Sonn described his client\u0027s fall from grace after being arrested.He said: \u0027On July 15 he was arguably the proudest man on the planet (having captained France to the World Cup victory).\u0027Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight.\u0027The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris.\u0027Mr Sonn added Lloris had initially booked a taxi but it cancelled, prompting Lloris to drive - something described by Mr Sonn as \u0027the first of a number of unwise decisions\u0027.He added: \u0027By 2am he was completely drunk. At that moment he should have left the vehicle where it was. But, as Mr Lloris pointed out to me, it is when you\u0027re drunk you\u0027re likely to make mistakes - that was to drive home.\u0027           Hugo Lloris (right) had spent the evening with Olivier Giroud (centre) and Laurent Koscielny (left) before his arrestSentencing Lloris, magistrate Amanda Barron said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper\u0027s financial means - though details of his salary were not disclosed in court.She said: \u0027This is a very serious offence, as you know.\u0027Not only were you putting your own life at risk but also that of your passenger.\u0027It was pure luck that you did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians in the central London area.\u0027 Today the footballer was met by a scrum of photographers who surrounded the Frenchman as he walked inside Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court.Lloris, wearing a dark suit and no tie, was flanked by two members of his entourage as he made his way from his vehicle into the court, confronted by dozens of photographers and video journalists. After sentencing, Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for charity Brake, said: \u0027It is disappointing to see that someone who is a role model to many thousands of football fans has admitted breaking the law by drink-driving.\u0027We expect the captain of Tottenham Hotspur and his national team to be setting a good example, not flouting the law in such a manner.\u0027This kind of dangerous behaviour is selfish, illegal and puts lives at risk.\u0027   Lloris faced one charge of driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limitTottenham were left understandably furious by the incident, as they were preparing for their Premier League clash with Manchester United. Lloris still started and surprisingly wore the captain\u0027s armband.What helped was the Frenchman showed public remorse after being arrested as he said in a statement: \u0027I wish to apologise wholeheartedly to my family, the club, my team-mates, the manager and all of the supporters.

They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.\u0027\u0027This is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear,\u0027 Sargentini said.          Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban holds a document of the Motion For a European Parliament Resolution, Article 7, during his speech at the European Parliament on TuesdayThe move saw some members of the European People\u0027s Party bloc - of which Orban\u0027s Fidesz movement is a member - vote against their ally in Budapest.Even EPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.\u0027I have always been in favor of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday (Tuesday) I didn\u0027t see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns,\u0027 Manfred tweeted.While Weber had called on Orban to show a willingness to compromise on some of the most high-profile issues - like an agreement being delayed by the Hungarian government for the Central European University, founded by George Soros, Orban\u0027s ideological opponent, to remain in Budapest and recent laws criminalising the work of civic groups working with asylum-seekers and refugees - Orban remained steadfast that his policies wouldn\u0027t change.\u0027I have nothing to compromise about since the questions they objected to were decided by the Hungarian people,\u0027 Orban said Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, after the debate in the European Parliament on the report on Hungary. \u0027There is nothing to talk about.\u0027Orban, who was re-elected in April to his third consecutive term in office, fourth overall also said Tuesday that he expected lawmakers to approve the motion with the support of some EPP lawmakers.\u0027The order has arrived from Berlin and they will vote accordingly,\u0027 Orban said, in reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose governing Christian Democratic Union is the largest party in the EPP.Orban has insisted that all of the criticism against his government is based on Hungary\u0027s tough anti-immigration policies, which include fences built in 2015 on Hungary\u0027s southern borders with Serbian and Croatia to ert the flow of migrants and very restrictive asylum rules. He has also expressed his desire to remain within the EPP, which he said was \u0027deeply ided\u0027 on the issue of migration. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/21/4E919DF000000578-0-image-a-5_1532550973907.jpg","title":"When Yom Kippur need know","story":"National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 12 SeptemberHurricane Florence: Why do storms and hurricanes have names?FIFA 19 demo: All you need to knowWho is Evanna Lynch?

Which is pretty scary odds if you\u0027re the president.\u0027Daniels declined to expand on her comments because of the ongoing legal action and did not explain her theory for how the presidency would end, although she said Trump would not resign because \u0027he\u0027s too arrogant\u0027.The 39-year-old has become a darling of the president\u0027s opponents as she sues to void a 2016 nondisclosure agreement barring her from discussing her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. The president denies having sex with Daniels and is contesting lawsuits brought by Avenatti on her part.She said her decision to take on Trump in public was a reaction to the bullying she had received from him and his associates.            Daniels met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in July 2006, (pictured) after which they had sex, according to her account\u0027I really just got tired of being bullied and came forward not thinking of how grandiose this was going to become,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was basically just me saying, to quote my attorney Michael Avenatti, \u0027Basta,\u0027 you know, \u0027Enough.\u0027 \u0027You leave me alone or I\u0027m going to tell my truth.\u0027\u0027Then I started to feel sort of in danger and there\u0027s that whole thing about hiding in plain sight.

Then eat and go to bed by 8pm.’)Wahlberg only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic and goes to church instead.I asked him why he puts himself through such mind-blowing physical abuse.He was blunt: ‘If you want to be really successful in this business, and stay there, that’s what it takes.’Given that Wahlberg is one of the world’s most bankable film stars (he told me he nicknamed his mansion “Ted” after buying it with the proceeds of that billion dollar movie franchise), he’s clearly reaping very large rewards from the sowing of all that self-punishment.But at what cost?It’s a question I’ve pondered many times over the 30 years I’ve interviewed big stars, many of whom go to ridiculous lengths to preserve their ‘camera-ready’ images.They dye their hair, slice up their faces, Botox their foreheads into creaseless early-embalmment, and lipo-suck their stomachs.And that’s just the normal stuff.For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things.Gwyneth Paltrow stings herself with bees. ‘It gets rid of inflammation and scarring,’ she explained, though she later admitted: ‘Man, it’s painful.’Salma Hayek puts guacamole, egg yolk and mayonnaise in her hair, Katie Holmes smears her head in snail slime, Victoria Beckham endures bird poo facials and Kim Kardashian posted pictures of herself undergoing a Vampire Facelift where blood is drawn from a victim’s arm and injected into the face to prevent wrinkles.          For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things, like Kim Kardashian undergoing a Vampire FaceliftAnything and everything to prevent the career-wrecking onset of old age.When I interviewed Janet Jackson for CNN, she told me, with undisguised horror on her face, that many famous women she knows eat Kleenex tissue paper to fill their stomachs and deter them from eating food.Imagine wanting fame that much?I can’t – I’d rather use Kleenex to wipe the béarnaise sauce off my lips as I devour a 20lb bone-in rib eye steak while simultaneously guzzling a nice bottle of Chateau Latour.For many actors though, food is not the fuel for life, it’s the professional enemy.When he played an AIDS sufferer in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 47lbs in four months by starving himself on a daily diet of just two egg whites, a bit of chicken, a spoonful of pudding and two Diet Cokes.It won him an Oscar but wow… he’s never getting those months back, is he?          Michael Phelps went five years without taking a single day off training. That\u0027s 20 years of birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas. Is anything worth it?It’s not just actors who do this kind of thing to themselves.Sportsmen all push themselves hard, but the really great ones go to ridiculous lengths to give themselves the edge.Olympic swimming icon Michael Phelps told me he once went five consecutive years without a single day off from training. That’s 1825 days, with 6-8 hours of work a day in and out of the pool.‘Do you know anyone else who has ever done that?’ I asked him.‘No,’ he replied.As with Wahlberg, his motivation was simple: ‘If you want to be the best, you have to be willing to do the things other people aren’t willing to do. I was getting 52 days more training than anyone else I was competing against.’For Phelps, his reward was more Gold medals than anyone in history. But to achieve that, he sacrificed 20 years of partying with friends and family events like birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas.Is ANYTHING really worth that?Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s very happily married with four children, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was a young man, and suffers from none of the false affectations or regular outbursts of outrageous ego that so often infest a major celebrity.          Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s happily married with four kids, shown here last Christmas, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was youngFrom my experience, he’s a regular down-to-earth guy (albeit one who matured from a violent, troublesome, criminal upbringing) whose talent and work ethic has brought him massive success, fame and wealth.But I couldn’t do what he does every day, could you?Don’t get me wrong: I want fame, and I’ve had a reasonably pleasurable taste of it.It’s fun, exciting and opens up all sorts of doors – like to first class plane cabins, brand new Aston Martins and the best restaurants in towns.But for me, there’s a limit to just how much I want it, and just how far I’m prepared to sweat for it.My regime for today for example will end up something like this:4.45am wake up and head to Good Morning Britain’s TV studios in London5.30am 1st breakfast6-8.30am sit at a desk arguing with people.9am 2nd breakfast10am spinning class or swim (if I can be bothered..)11am sleep12pm argue with people on Twitter1pm lunch2pm sit at a desk writing argumentative columns for Daily Mail.5pm argue with people on Twitter about my columns6pm pub for a pint7pm dinner8pm watch TV9.45pm sleep          My daily regime\u0027s plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer. But it doesn\u0027t pay as well as The plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer.The down side is that this doesn’t pay quite as well as being a movie superstar or record-breaking Olympic Gold medal champion.But I know in my heart I just don’t have what it takes to be a Phelps or Mark Wahlberg (before the inevitable mockery lights up for even attempting to put myself in the same celebrity bracket as him, let me remind you that I’ve been in eight movies which have grossed $1.8 billion, including Entourage in which I had a bigger part than Mr Wahlberg..)I simply don’t want to sweat that much, well not unless it includes the kind of sweat you get with a ferocious hangover after a fantastic party.Nor do I want to sting myself with bees, pay a plastic surgeon a small fortune to chop off my jowls, or live off diet cokes and egg whites.The bottom line is this: I like and admire Mark Wahlberg, but having seen his daily schedule, I have zero desire to actually be him.Frankly, if that’s what fame costs – I ain’t paying. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/15/50132F4100000578-0-image-m-26_1536763198934.jpg","title":"South Carolina slave descendants used riding storms","story":"John Brown stands behind a fence for his cows outside his home on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, on Tuesday. Thousands of black residents of the island trace their ancestry back to West African slaves and are deeply rooted in traditionRespect for tradition and deep cultural roots have persisted for generations on the island, which is the largest Gullah community on the South Carolina coast.An estimated 5,000 or more people living here are descended from slaves who worked rice plantations in the area before they were freed by the Civil War.Smaller enclaves of Gullah, referred to as Geechee in some areas, are scattered along the Southeast coast from North Carolina to Florida.The ring of thunder: Satellite image shows nine potentially...Hurricane Florence: Why do storms and hurricanes have names?Share this articleScholars say separation from the mainland caused the Gullah to retain much of their African heritage, including a unique dialect and skills such as cast-net fishing and basket weaving.Destructive hurricanes haven\u0027t been too frequent in St. Helena Island\u0027s past. But the so-called Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893 devastated the area after rolling ashore in Savannah, Georgia, and killed an estimated 2,000 people.Hurricane Florence is set to bring churning 83ft waves, four feet of rain, a 13-foot storm surge and $170 billion worth of destruction when it hits on Thursday night. Forecasters say it could linger for days.  A utility pole stands in the middle of a marsh at sunset on Sapelo Island, Ga., a Gullah-Geechee community which is used to riding out big storms. Pictured on May 16, 2013  Sapelo Island (pictured in 2013) has been repeatedly lashed by hurricanes, and is vulnerable to storm surges coming in from the sea Emory Campbell, a Gullah descendant and scholar, recalled riding as a boy in a neighbor\u0027s old cart on Hilton Head Island as Hurricane Gracie struck in 1959 and tore the roof off a hotel.\u0027We saw some remnants of hurricanes here when I was growing up,\u0027 Campbell said. \u0027The wind would blow, you\u0027d put some tin up against the window, but you wouldn\u0027t know that much except for the scratchy sounds on the radio coming out of Savannah.\u0027Hurricane Matthew smashed and toppled trees across surrounding Beaufort County in 2016 but largely spared the modest ranch houses, bungalows and mobile homes of St. Helena Island.John Brown, 54, said he spent two weeks after Matthew cutting up fallen trees with a chain saw in his job for a municipal public works department. A giant live oak uprooted by the storm remains intact across the street from Brown\u0027s home.\u0027If my job didn\u0027t require me to stay, I\u0027d be out of here in a heartbeat,\u0027 Brown said after giving fresh water to his four cows Tuesday. \u0027I think most of the older ones, they\u0027re kind of stubborn. But the younger ones, not so much.\u0027St Helena residents said people started filling up gas cans and buying supplies Monday when the governor ordered evacuations for the entire South Carolina coast.           People in the Carolinas have been urged to evacuate their homes before the storm hits. Pictured is a hurricane shelter at Trask Middle School in North Carolina on Tuesday Things calmed down Tuesday when the order was lifted for Beaufort County, though some local restaurants and businesses stayed closed.Florence\u0027s track remained uncertain Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to slow as it moves toward the Carolinas and could even change direction before coming ashore.Bertha Bradley wasn\u0027t worrying. She and her husband grew up on St. Helena Island and own Bradley\u0027s Seafood, a small cinderblock shop where they sell shrimp, flounder and whiting, all caught by their son.Bradley said she has never favored evacuating ahead of hurricanes, in part because her great-grandmother never did. Bradley and her husband missed Gracie in 1959 because they were in Savannah after getting married. One subsequent storm, she\u0027s not sure which one, scared them enough to get them to leave the island.But the traffic, she said, was awful.\u0027I said, \u0027Why get on the road like this? I\u0027m going to get killed on the road,\u0027\u0027 Bradley said. \u0027I should stay in my house, where I have water and food.

The episode was going to include actual news footage of Trump, the Charlottesville riots and NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality.Spike Lee was going to narrate the episode and Sam Cooke\u0027s ballad A Change Is Gonna Come was going to be played. Barris told the outlet that production even upped their usual episode budget of $3million.\u0027This was about me trying to pat the butt of the country and soothe people,\u0027 he said. Barris, however, never got a chance to tell his story. The producer said he spent weeks going back-and-forth with network officials about the fate of the show and tried editing some stuff out. When they couldn\u0027t come to an agreement, ABC decided to scrap the episode and not long after the producer began talks on how to get out of his four-year contract.\u0027I don\u0027t know that I would have been as useful to them as they\u0027d need me to be after that,\u0027 he said. Despite ABC shelving Barris\u0027 episode, he told The Hollywood Reporter that he still refers to many of the executives at the company as \u0027family\u0027 - with the exception of embattled Disney-ABC Television Group president Ben Sherwood. Elementary school principal fights for job after calling...#ImWithKap jerseys sell out in only a few hours after former...Share this article    Anthony Anderson (left) criticized ABC for shelving the show, while Tracee Ellis Ross (right) said the network\u0027s decision was \u0027frightening\u0027           Barris also had some harsh words for Roseanne Barr saying: \u0027She\u0027s a f***in\u0027 monster\u0027\u0027The way that (Ben) chose to deal with me in this particular episode, I felt a way about it and I still do,\u0027 Barris told the outlet. \u0027He\u0027d make it seem like it was an open environment but really it wasn\u0027t, and those are things I see very clearly.

One MP reckoned that the kids would be \u0027marked forever\u0027.The Home Secretary said it was \u0027absolutely disgraceful\u0027. Mr Rees-Mogg took a rather different line, telling journalists \u0027I wouldn\u0027t get too excited about it…it wasn\u0027t terribly well organised, or terribly serious….we are a free country, they weren\u0027t violent…not everybody is going to like me\u0027.Game, set and match to Rees Mogg and Nanny Crook.Contrast Mr Bone\u0027s raging in a London street with events at the US Open Women\u0027s final last weekend.The most successful female sportswoman of all time had a huge tantrum in front of a sold-out stadium, smashing her racquet, calling the umpire a liar and a thief - all of which cost her valuable penalty points and the loss of a game.          Furious Williams argues with RamosIn the ensuing furore, we seemed to forget that another woman - Japan\u0027s Naomi Osaka - won her first Grand Slam title - although she spent most of the awards ceremony head down, in tears.Serena\u0027s meltdown was justified by tennis legend Billie Jean King and former US Open runner up Victoria Azarenka, who agreed that the umpire was sexist and would not have treated a male player in the same way.Billie Jean tweeted \u0027when a woman is emotional, she\u0027s \u0027hysterical\u0027 and she\u0027s penalised for it. When a man does the same, he\u0027s outspoken \u0026amp there are no repercussions. Thank you @serenawilliams for calling out this double standard.\u0027Williams herself tweeted to say she was just expressing strong emotions, and that her rage might enable other women to feel free to do that.One columnist has suggested that Serena\u0027s meltdown was partly because her child is almost a year old, and that\u0027s affected her brain, making her slightly bonkers, and pulled in two directions.I disagree - Serena was out to win her 24th Grand Slam title, to make history, and she went off the rails when her master plan was derailed (Osaka won the first set) because she couldn\u0027t control her emotions.By saying she was a feminist, telling the umpire \u0027I\u0027m here fighting for women\u0027s rights and for women\u0027s equality…and for my daughter\u0027, she was not empowering other women.Unfortunately, she crossed the line from sportsmanship (or sportspersonship) into brat - surely she could have made her point without the racquet smashing, the shouting?    Class activists launched an extraordinary tirade at Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s children – including his six-year-old son – telling them their daddy is a \u0027totally horrible person\u0027Yes, her meltdown will make officials more careful in future, but is this how women should behave to get their rights? Do we have to fight as dirty as men do? I hate losing an argument, but when I start ranting and my voice cracks (as Serena\u0027s did) I know that I have let myself down. Steely self-control gets you further in the end.Mr Bone is not a likeable inidual by any stretch of the imagination - but he is entitled to stage a demonstration for worker\u0027s rights and to express his left wing opinions, even if it happens right outside a posh bloke\u0027s home in Mayfair.JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...\u0027Mum you can\u0027t do this, he\u0027s going to kill you too\u0027:...Share this articleI\u0027m not a fan of Rees-Mogg, with his antiquated view on birth control (he\u0027s a devout Catholic) and Brexit (he\u0027s rabidly pro-Brexit, determined to lead his party no matter what it takes), but I find his presence a bit of light relief in the dreary hinterland of British parliamentarians. Mostly, they parrot the party line, spending their time tweeting and being politically correct, not daring to step out of line for fear of demotion.Britain hasn\u0027t banned free speech (yet), and if Mr Bone finds the curiously faux-fogey Jacob Rees-Mogg a disgusting example of class and privilege and everything that is wrong with British society, fair enough.          One of the three violations Ramos called on Williams was for racket abuse, after the superstar smashed her racket (above) on the court in reaction to losing a gameAs a student in London, I regularly went on anti-war protests, even chucking plastic bags of butcher\u0027s blood at police horses and calling their riders \u0027pigs\u0027.In the late 1960\u0027s thousands of us participated in college sit-ins and demonstrations against nuclear war. In some ways, Mr Bone and his Class War colleagues are a throwback to these glorious days of anarchic protest. He thinks that people should be banned from going to Eton, and that the working class should be occupying the £10 million empty flats in London\u0027s Shard.Dream on!His Class War newspaper has seen it\u0027s circulation dwindle, even though they\u0027ve come up with some publicity-grabbing stunts, like the front page headline after the birth of Prince William - \u0027Another F*****g royal parasite\u0027.Although the rant at the Rees-Mogg nanny was distasteful, Bone has a point. The number of poor people working as slaves in domestic households in Britain has risen sharply in recent years - but they are just as likely to be trapped in middle class homes as obvious toffs like Mr R-M. And if Nanny Crook didn\u0027t like her pay and conditions, what\u0027s she still doing wiping bottoms after 71 years?But if on the off-chance she has had enough on High Tory life she might bring her child-minding skills to help multi-millionaire Serena Williams control her tantrums.           The three clearly stunned youngsters stood while their parents tried to usher them inside, but they still heard the full bullying rant demanding that the protesters know how much their nanny Veronica Crook (above in black) is paid"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/01/501A3D6E00000578-6161763-image-m-7_1536797494267.jpg","title":"British grandmother eight 50 pregnant QUADRUPLETS","story":"    The mother-of-three (pictured) says she doesn\u0027t care about people who doubt her Grandmother Tracey Britten would be forgiven for settling down and embracing the quiet life now that her children are grown up.But mother-of-three Mrs Britten, 50, has chosen to yet again take up the parenting reins as she will soon become the oldest mother of quadruplets in the UK.The former drugs counsellor is expecting three girls, including identical twins, and a boy with her roofer husband, Stephen, after the pair opted to pay for IVF.Mrs Britten spent £7,000 of her mother’s inheritance on the miracle fertility treatment in Cyprus to ensure that she conceived given her age.The grandmother, who has eight grandchildren, last night told of her elation at being pregnant later in life.Mrs Britten told The Sun: ‘Every year I still wanted another child.

As a result of showing contrition after being arrested and charged, he is set to keep his captaincy.           The footballer was met by a scrum of photographers who surrounded the Frenchman          His club said the drink driving charge would be taken \u0027extremely seriously\u0027 and dealt with internallyOutlining the case, prosecutor Mr Fitch said: \u0027Shortly before 2.20am, officers were on patrol in an unmarked vehicle when their attention was drawn to a Porsche - it was moving strangely and doing 15mph in a 30mph zone.\u0027It veered a number of times towards parked vehicles, nearly clipping them, before correcting itself. It then went through a red light.\u0027Defence counsel Mr Sonn described his client\u0027s fall from grace after being arrested.He said: \u0027On July 15 he was arguably the proudest man on the planet (having captained France to the World Cup victory).\u0027Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight.\u0027The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris.\u0027Mr Sonn added Lloris had initially booked a taxi but it cancelled, prompting Lloris to drive - something described by Mr Sonn as \u0027the first of a number of unwise decisions\u0027.He added: \u0027By 2am he was completely drunk. At that moment he should have left the vehicle where it was.

They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.\u0027\u0027This is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear,\u0027 Sargentini said.          Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban holds a document of the Motion For a European Parliament Resolution, Article 7, during his speech at the European Parliament on TuesdayThe move saw some members of the European People\u0027s Party bloc - of which Orban\u0027s Fidesz movement is a member - vote against their ally in Budapest.Even EPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.\u0027I have always been in favor of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday (Tuesday) I didn\u0027t see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns,\u0027 Manfred tweeted.While Weber had called on Orban to show a willingness to compromise on some of the most high-profile issues - like an agreement being delayed by the Hungarian government for the Central European University, founded by George Soros, Orban\u0027s ideological opponent, to remain in Budapest and recent laws criminalising the work of civic groups working with asylum-seekers and refugees - Orban remained steadfast that his policies wouldn\u0027t change.\u0027I have nothing to compromise about since the questions they objected to were decided by the Hungarian people,\u0027 Orban said Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, after the debate in the European Parliament on the report on Hungary. \u0027There is nothing to talk about.\u0027Orban, who was re-elected in April to his third consecutive term in office, fourth overall also said Tuesday that he expected lawmakers to approve the motion with the support of some EPP lawmakers.\u0027The order has arrived from Berlin and they will vote accordingly,\u0027 Orban said, in reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose governing Christian Democratic Union is the largest party in the EPP.Orban has insisted that all of the criticism against his government is based on Hungary\u0027s tough anti-immigration policies, which include fences built in 2015 on Hungary\u0027s southern borders with Serbian and Croatia to ert the flow of migrants and very restrictive asylum rules. He has also expressed his desire to remain within the EPP, which he said was \u0027deeply ided\u0027 on the issue of migration. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/15/5012853500000578-0-image-a-49_1536761806038.jpg","title":"Tasered British sailors knock teeth best friends","story":"British sailors Thomas Reffold (left) and Ieuen Edwards (right) were tasered by police in Florida after a night of drunkenness following their ship\u0027s docking in Jacksonville  Steven Gorley (left) and Matthew Cotham (right) were also arrested after trouble flaredA second sailor, Ieuen Edwards, 21, also had a Taser gun used on him by officers after he allegedly punched a person and then resisted arrest.After two and a half weeks at sea, the crew of 1,500 sailors, aircrew and marines descended on a coastal resort at Jacksonville Beach, Florida, on Wednesday night.Locals saw British navy personnel kicked out of bars and fighting each other after HMS Queen Elizabeth arrived at Naval Station Mayport.Russia demonstrates the power of its deadly missiles...US Air Force to roll out implanted headset device for TEETH...Share this articleJacksonville Police arrest records claim officers were forced to arrest a third sailor, Dominic Gregory, after he got into an argument with friends about returning to the ship.Instead of boarding a bus to return the sailors to the aircraft carrier, the 19-year-old, who was arrested for disorderly intoxication, became \u0027verbally abusive\u0027 before lying down in the road and refusing to move.Three further sailors were arrested after the night out Steven Gorley, Matthew Cotham and Jamie Lutas.

I know this routine is real. Several years ago he invited me to dinner at his palatial home in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, showed me his massive underground gym (it’s the size of a small aircraft hangar), and told me. He only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic(When he’s away filming, his schedule gets even more insane. He said: ‘I wake at 2.30am, and do an hour’s hard workout from 3am to 4am, with ten-second breaks. Then we drive to a local basketball court and do two-on-two for an hour. I come back to the hotel at 6am and have a plate of chicken and vegetables before heading to the set around 7am. I do 500 sit-ups through the day in my trailer to keep fresh. I finish at 6pm, go back to the hotel and do 45 minutes boxing. Then eat and go to bed by 8pm.’)Wahlberg only rests on Sundays because he’s a devout Catholic and goes to church instead.I asked him why he puts himself through such mind-blowing physical abuse.He was blunt: ‘If you want to be really successful in this business, and stay there, that’s what it takes.’Given that Wahlberg is one of the world’s most bankable film stars (he told me he nicknamed his mansion “Ted” after buying it with the proceeds of that billion dollar movie franchise), he’s clearly reaping very large rewards from the sowing of all that self-punishment.But at what cost?It’s a question I’ve pondered many times over the 30 years I’ve interviewed big stars, many of whom go to ridiculous lengths to preserve their ‘camera-ready’ images.They dye their hair, slice up their faces, Botox their foreheads into creaseless early-embalmment, and lipo-suck their stomachs.And that’s just the normal stuff.For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things.Gwyneth Paltrow stings herself with bees. ‘It gets rid of inflammation and scarring,’ she explained, though she later admitted: ‘Man, it’s painful.’Salma Hayek puts guacamole, egg yolk and mayonnaise in her hair, Katie Holmes smears her head in snail slime, Victoria Beckham endures bird poo facials and Kim Kardashian posted pictures of herself undergoing a Vampire Facelift where blood is drawn from a victim’s arm and injected into the face to prevent wrinkles.          For female stars in particular, the pressure to be skinny or youthful drives them to do stupid or dangerous things, like Kim Kardashian undergoing a Vampire FaceliftAnything and everything to prevent the career-wrecking onset of old age.When I interviewed Janet Jackson for CNN, she told me, with undisguised horror on her face, that many famous women she knows eat Kleenex tissue paper to fill their stomachs and deter them from eating food.Imagine wanting fame that much?I can’t – I’d rather use Kleenex to wipe the béarnaise sauce off my lips as I devour a 20lb bone-in rib eye steak while simultaneously guzzling a nice bottle of Chateau Latour.For many actors though, food is not the fuel for life, it’s the professional enemy.When he played an AIDS sufferer in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 47lbs in four months by starving himself on a daily diet of just two egg whites, a bit of chicken, a spoonful of pudding and two Diet Cokes.It won him an Oscar but wow… he’s never getting those months back, is he?          Michael Phelps went five years without taking a single day off training. That\u0027s 20 years of birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas. Is anything worth it?It’s not just actors who do this kind of thing to themselves.Sportsmen all push themselves hard, but the really great ones go to ridiculous lengths to give themselves the edge.Olympic swimming icon Michael Phelps told me he once went five consecutive years without a single day off from training. That’s 1825 days, with 6-8 hours of work a day in and out of the pool.‘Do you know anyone else who has ever done that?’ I asked him.‘No,’ he replied.As with Wahlberg, his motivation was simple: ‘If you want to be the best, you have to be willing to do the things other people aren’t willing to do. I was getting 52 days more training than anyone else I was competing against.’For Phelps, his reward was more Gold medals than anyone in history. But to achieve that, he sacrificed 20 years of partying with friends and family events like birthdays, weddings, Thanksgivings and Christmas.Is ANYTHING really worth that?Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s very happily married with four children, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was a young man, and suffers from none of the false affectations or regular outbursts of outrageous ego that so often infest a major celebrity.          Mark Wahlberg is one of the most normal big stars I know he’s happily married with four kids, shown here last Christmas, has the same circle of loyal friends he’s had since he was youngFrom my experience, he’s a regular down-to-earth guy (albeit one who matured from a violent, troublesome, criminal upbringing) whose talent and work ethic has brought him massive success, fame and wealth.But I couldn’t do what he does every day, could you?Don’t get me wrong: I want fame, and I’ve had a reasonably pleasurable taste of it.It’s fun, exciting and opens up all sorts of doors – like to first class plane cabins, brand new Aston Martins and the best restaurants in towns.But for me, there’s a limit to just how much I want it, and just how far I’m prepared to sweat for it.My regime for today for example will end up something like this:4.45am wake up and head to Good Morning Britain’s TV studios in London5.30am 1st breakfast6-8.30am sit at a desk arguing with people.9am 2nd breakfast10am spinning class or swim (if I can be bothered..)11am sleep12pm argue with people on Twitter1pm lunch2pm sit at a desk writing argumentative columns for Daily Mail.5pm argue with people on Twitter about my columns6pm pub for a pint7pm dinner8pm watch TV9.45pm sleep          My daily regime\u0027s plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer. But it doesn\u0027t pay as well as The plus side is that it involves very little physical hard work, and I think I can also legitimately claim to be a world-class arguer.The down side is that this doesn’t pay quite as well as being a movie superstar or record-breaking Olympic Gold medal champion.But I know in my heart I just don’t have what it takes to be a Phelps or Mark Wahlberg (before the inevitable mockery lights up for even attempting to put myself in the same celebrity bracket as him, let me remind you that I’ve been in eight movies which have grossed $1.8 billion, including Entourage in which I had a bigger part than Mr Wahlberg..)I simply don’t want to sweat that much, well not unless it includes the kind of sweat you get with a ferocious hangover after a fantastic party.Nor do I want to sting myself with bees, pay a plastic surgeon a small fortune to chop off my jowls, or live off diet cokes and egg whites.The bottom line is this: I like and admire Mark Wahlberg, but having seen his daily schedule, I have zero desire to actually be him.Frankly, if that’s what fame costs – I ain’t paying. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/12/15/50132F4100000578-0-image-m-26_1536763198934.jpg","title":"South Carolina slave descendants used riding storms","story":"John Brown stands behind a fence for his cows outside his home on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, on Tuesday. Thousands of black residents of the island trace their ancestry back to West African slaves and are deeply rooted in traditionRespect for tradition and deep cultural roots have persisted for generations on the island, which is the largest Gullah community on the South Carolina coast.An estimated 5,000 or more people living here are descended from slaves who worked rice plantations in the area before they were freed by the Civil War.Smaller enclaves of Gullah, referred to as Geechee in some areas, are scattered along the Southeast coast from North Carolina to Florida.The ring of thunder: Satellite image shows nine potentially...Hurricane Florence: Why do storms and hurricanes have names?Share this articleScholars say separation from the mainland caused the Gullah to retain much of their African heritage, including a unique dialect and skills such as cast-net fishing and basket weaving.Destructive hurricanes haven\u0027t been too frequent in St. Helena Island\u0027s past. But the so-called Sea Islands Hurricane of 1893 devastated the area after rolling ashore in Savannah, Georgia, and killed an estimated 2,000 people.Hurricane Florence is set to bring churning 83ft waves, four feet of rain, a 13-foot storm surge and $170 billion worth of destruction when it hits on Thursday night. Forecasters say it could linger for days.  A utility pole stands in the middle of a marsh at sunset on Sapelo Island, Ga., a Gullah-Geechee community which is used to riding out big storms. Pictured on May 16, 2013  Sapelo Island (pictured in 2013) has been repeatedly lashed by hurricanes, and is vulnerable to storm surges coming in from the sea Emory Campbell, a Gullah descendant and scholar, recalled riding as a boy in a neighbor\u0027s old cart on Hilton Head Island as Hurricane Gracie struck in 1959 and tore the roof off a hotel.\u0027We saw some remnants of hurricanes here when I was growing up,\u0027 Campbell said. \u0027The wind would blow, you\u0027d put some tin up against the window, but you wouldn\u0027t know that much except for the scratchy sounds on the radio coming out of Savannah.\u0027Hurricane Matthew smashed and toppled trees across surrounding Beaufort County in 2016 but largely spared the modest ranch houses, bungalows and mobile homes of St. Helena Island.John Brown, 54, said he spent two weeks after Matthew cutting up fallen trees with a chain saw in his job for a municipal public works department. A giant live oak uprooted by the storm remains intact across the street from Brown\u0027s home.\u0027If my job didn\u0027t require me to stay, I\u0027d be out of here in a heartbeat,\u0027 Brown said after giving fresh water to his four cows Tuesday. \u0027I think most of the older ones, they\u0027re kind of stubborn. But the younger ones, not so much.\u0027St Helena residents said people started filling up gas cans and buying supplies Monday when the governor ordered evacuations for the entire South Carolina coast.           People in the Carolinas have been urged to evacuate their homes before the storm hits. Pictured is a hurricane shelter at Trask Middle School in North Carolina on Tuesday Things calmed down Tuesday when the order was lifted for Beaufort County, though some local restaurants and businesses stayed closed.Florence\u0027s track remained uncertain Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to slow as it moves toward the Carolinas and could even change direction before coming ashore.Bertha Bradley wasn\u0027t worrying. She and her husband grew up on St. Helena Island and own Bradley\u0027s Seafood, a small cinderblock shop where they sell shrimp, flounder and whiting, all caught by their son.Bradley said she has never favored evacuating ahead of hurricanes, in part because her great-grandmother never did. Bradley and her husband missed Gracie in 1959 because they were in Savannah after getting married. One subsequent storm, she\u0027s not sure which one, scared them enough to get them to leave the island.But the traffic, she said, was awful.\u0027I said, \u0027Why get on the road like this? I\u0027m going to get killed on the road,\u0027\u0027 Bradley said. \u0027I should stay in my house, where I have water and food.

Pictured is the cast from a scene in \u0027All Groan Up\u0027The episode was supposed to show Dre, Anthony Anderson\u0027s character, telling his infant son a bedtime story about what\u0027s been happening in the country. The episode was going to include actual news footage of Trump, the Charlottesville riots and NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality.Spike Lee was going to narrate the episode and Sam Cooke\u0027s ballad A Change Is Gonna Come was going to be played. Barris told the outlet that production even upped their usual episode budget of $3million.\u0027This was about me trying to pat the butt of the country and soothe people,\u0027 he said. Barris, however, never got a chance to tell his story. The producer said he spent weeks going back-and-forth with network officials about the fate of the show and tried editing some stuff out. When they couldn\u0027t come to an agreement, ABC decided to scrap the episode and not long after the producer began talks on how to get out of his four-year contract.\u0027I don\u0027t know that I would have been as useful to them as they\u0027d need me to be after that,\u0027 he said. Despite ABC shelving Barris\u0027 episode, he told The Hollywood Reporter that he still refers to many of the executives at the company as \u0027family\u0027 - with the exception of embattled Disney-ABC Television Group president Ben Sherwood. Elementary school principal fights for job after calling...#ImWithKap jerseys sell out in only a few hours after former...Share this article    Anthony Anderson (left) criticized ABC for shelving the show, while Tracee Ellis Ross (right) said the network\u0027s decision was \u0027frightening\u0027           Barris also had some harsh words for Roseanne Barr saying: \u0027She\u0027s a f***in\u0027 monster\u0027\u0027The way that (Ben) chose to deal with me in this particular episode, I felt a way about it and I still do,\u0027 Barris told the outlet. \u0027He\u0027d make it seem like it was an open environment but really it wasn\u0027t, and those are things I see very clearly.

One MP reckoned that the kids would be \u0027marked forever\u0027.The Home Secretary said it was \u0027absolutely disgraceful\u0027. Mr Rees-Mogg took a rather different line, telling journalists \u0027I wouldn\u0027t get too excited about it…it wasn\u0027t terribly well organised, or terribly serious….we are a free country, they weren\u0027t violent…not everybody is going to like me\u0027.Game, set and match to Rees Mogg and Nanny Crook.Contrast Mr Bone\u0027s raging in a London street with events at the US Open Women\u0027s final last weekend.The most successful female sportswoman of all time had a huge tantrum in front of a sold-out stadium, smashing her racquet, calling the umpire a liar and a thief - all of which cost her valuable penalty points and the loss of a game.          Furious Williams argues with RamosIn the ensuing furore, we seemed to forget that another woman - Japan\u0027s Naomi Osaka - won her first Grand Slam title - although she spent most of the awards ceremony head down, in tears.Serena\u0027s meltdown was justified by tennis legend Billie Jean King and former US Open runner up Victoria Azarenka, who agreed that the umpire was sexist and would not have treated a male player in the same way.Billie Jean tweeted \u0027when a woman is emotional, she\u0027s \u0027hysterical\u0027 and she\u0027s penalised for it. When a man does the same, he\u0027s outspoken \u0026amp there are no repercussions. Thank you @serenawilliams for calling out this double standard.\u0027Williams herself tweeted to say she was just expressing strong emotions, and that her rage might enable other women to feel free to do that.One columnist has suggested that Serena\u0027s meltdown was partly because her child is almost a year old, and that\u0027s affected her brain, making her slightly bonkers, and pulled in two directions.I disagree - Serena was out to win her 24th Grand Slam title, to make history, and she went off the rails when her master plan was derailed (Osaka won the first set) because she couldn\u0027t control her emotions.By saying she was a feminist, telling the umpire \u0027I\u0027m here fighting for women\u0027s rights and for women\u0027s equality…and for my daughter\u0027, she was not empowering other women.Unfortunately, she crossed the line from sportsmanship (or sportspersonship) into brat - surely she could have made her point without the racquet smashing, the shouting?    Class activists launched an extraordinary tirade at Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s children – including his six-year-old son – telling them their daddy is a \u0027totally horrible person\u0027Yes, her meltdown will make officials more careful in future, but is this how women should behave to get their rights? Do we have to fight as dirty as men do? I hate losing an argument, but when I start ranting and my voice cracks (as Serena\u0027s did) I know that I have let myself down. Steely self-control gets you further in the end.Mr Bone is not a likeable inidual by any stretch of the imagination - but he is entitled to stage a demonstration for worker\u0027s rights and to express his left wing opinions, even if it happens right outside a posh bloke\u0027s home in Mayfair.JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...\u0027Mum you can\u0027t do this, he\u0027s going to kill you too\u0027:...Share this articleI\u0027m not a fan of Rees-Mogg, with his antiquated view on birth control (he\u0027s a devout Catholic) and Brexit (he\u0027s rabidly pro-Brexit, determined to lead his party no matter what it takes), but I find his presence a bit of light relief in the dreary hinterland of British parliamentarians. Mostly, they parrot the party line, spending their time tweeting and being politically correct, not daring to step out of line for fear of demotion.Britain hasn\u0027t banned free speech (yet), and if Mr Bone finds the curiously faux-fogey Jacob Rees-Mogg a disgusting example of class and privilege and everything that is wrong with British society, fair enough.          One of the three violations Ramos called on Williams was for racket abuse, after the superstar smashed her racket (above) on the court in reaction to losing a gameAs a student in London, I regularly went on anti-war protests, even chucking plastic bags of butcher\u0027s blood at police horses and calling their riders \u0027pigs\u0027.In the late 1960\u0027s thousands of us participated in college sit-ins and demonstrations against nuclear war. In some ways, Mr Bone and his Class War colleagues are a throwback to these glorious days of anarchic protest. He thinks that people should be banned from going to Eton, and that the working class should be occupying the £10 million empty flats in London\u0027s Shard.Dream on!His Class War newspaper has seen it\u0027s circulation dwindle, even though they\u0027ve come up with some publicity-grabbing stunts, like the front page headline after the birth of Prince William - \u0027Another F*****g royal parasite\u0027.Although the rant at the Rees-Mogg nanny was distasteful, Bone has a point. The number of poor people working as slaves in domestic households in Britain has risen sharply in recent years - but they are just as likely to be trapped in middle class homes as obvious toffs like Mr R-M. And if Nanny Crook didn\u0027t like her pay and conditions, what\u0027s she still doing wiping bottoms after 71 years?But if on the off-chance she has had enough on High Tory life she might bring her child-minding skills to help multi-millionaire Serena Williams control her tantrums.           The three clearly stunned youngsters stood while their parents tried to usher them inside, but they still heard the full bullying rant demanding that the protesters know how much their nanny Veronica Crook (above in black) is paid"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/01/501A3D6E00000578-6161763-image-m-7_1536797494267.jpg","title":"British grandmother eight 50 pregnant QUADRUPLETS","story":"    The mother-of-three (pictured) says she doesn\u0027t care about people who doubt her Grandmother Tracey Britten would be forgiven for settling down and embracing the quiet life now that her children are grown up.But mother-of-three Mrs Britten, 50, has chosen to yet again take up the parenting reins as she will soon become the oldest mother of quadruplets in the UK.The former drugs counsellor is expecting three girls, including identical twins, and a boy with her roofer husband, Stephen, after the pair opted to pay for IVF.Mrs Britten spent £7,000 of her mother’s inheritance on the miracle fertility treatment in Cyprus to ensure that she conceived given her age.The grandmother, who has eight grandchildren, last night told of her elation at being pregnant later in life.Mrs Britten told The Sun: ‘Every year I still wanted another child.

Ma’s Swimmer of Yangtze provides a brutal insight into the rise and fall of community heroes.The story follows the disabled son of a tailor, a boy from a humble, nameless village near Wuhan in Cultural Revolution-era China, as he becomes an unlikely Paralympian hero. Told from the perspective of a village elder, it leads the reader on a journey of hope and sorrow.Ma beat 300 other writers to win. Judge and culture associate editor for the , Claire Armitsteadpraised Ma’s “impressively controlled and deeply melancholy story of an isolated rural community who look on in bemusement as one of their number is snatched from their midst to become an international sporting hero in an event that is beyond comprehension.”This is not the only recognition Ma’s short story had received. It was shortlisted for both the 2017 Commonwealth short story prize and the LitMag Virginia Woolf award earlier this year.A recent graduate of Stanford University and winner of a highly competitive 2018 artist’s grant from the Vermont Studio Centre, Ma’s short stories have previously appeared in Ricepaper magazine and been shortlisted for competitions run by journals Glimmer Train and Geist.Ma’s stirring work was the highlight among a shortlist of six stories that tackled contemporary issues with full force, including Varaidzo’s Bus Stop, an exploration of identity, sexuality and gender and Savannah Burney’s Spam, a humorous take on an unlikely encounter between a cynical B\u0026ampB owner and Grenfell tower victims.Anna Kelly, 4th Estate commissioning editor and chair of the judging panel, praised all of the entrants. “I’m looking forward to seeing their careers progress over the coming years,” she said. “I expect to see many of the shortlisted and longlisted writers signing with agents very soon.”In a ceremony on Wednesday night, Ma received £1,000 and an exclusive one-day publishing workshop at 4th Estate. Swimmer of the Yangtze can be read below.The boy had been born with four healthy limbs but by the end of his first year, he had already lost both his arms. Broad, toned shoulders gave him the triangular physique that so many young men craved, as if his upper body were perfectly fitted for a Zhongshan tunic suit – although if he were actually to have worn one, his father would have needed to trim both sleeves off so as to draw less attention to his son’s missing limbs beneath blue and black cloth.Both his parents had worked as tailors in our humble village near Wuhan, as their own forefathers had done. They had been born during the glorious years of the Long March and the rise of our Communist Party recently they had enjoyed the fortune of watching our leader Chairman Mao e into the Yangtze River to swim against ‘the great wind and great waves of the bourgeois’. Oh, how lucky we all had been to witness the launch of our Cultural Revolution! Only two days after the swim, Chairman Mao – may he live for 10,000 years! – returned to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to arrest that traitor Liu Shaoqi, who died a mere three years later after a too-few number of public beatings at party denunciation meetings.As a baby, the Swimmer had been ordinary. He cried, as all boys do while they get used to empty stomachs. He was skinny but not overly malnourished. Almost daily he had been breastfed by his mother, until she fell sick from some evil curse which the doctor had called pneumonia and would later sour her milk. For the next year, his father would stitch an extra Zhongshan suit each week to afford the extra cost of cow’s milk for his only son.Soon the rumour would spread all over the village near Wuhan that the Swimmer’s mother could no longer give birth for why else would the tailor not have compelled his wife to try again after her illness for another child, one not so accursed?Still, the story of how the boy lost his arms remains a mystery. Some whispered that it was caused by some fungus stemming from the baby’s long baths in the Yangtze, since the tailor’s shop near the river had also served as their family sleeping quarters. Others say his disease was genetic but to those gossipers, I ask: why did his ailment affect only his arms, and not the rest of his body? All we know for certain is that when the boy was barely eight months old – and he is truly blessed by the Holy Buddha that he was too young to remember this – his parents took him to Wuhan Children’s Hospital one evening and when they returned, their child no longer had arms. Later, the rumour flooded our village that the father had locked himself inside his workshop for three straight days after returning from the hospital: all so that he could sew a new set of clothes for his boy, none of which bore a single sleeve.Surely, his mother must have been devastated! First, her son had lost his arms! But then her pneumonia, which had already cost her family a fortune in cow’s milk, began to give her such severe headaches that she could no longer help her husband with his tailor shop and of course, this only tightened money matters more.So what to do with a boy with no arms? Sure, he did not need to flip over the pages of old texts written by Li Bai or Du Fu, but also he did not have any hands to feel the fine wrinkles in a piece of fabric or operate a sewing machine. Who would inherit his family’s shop?Many in the village wondered about this. They would gossip over bowls of beef noodles, making bets about when the tailor might sell his shop on the cheap. I, of course, did none of this and flashed evil eyes when I heard them whisper about the tailor and his armless son until news spread to my door one night that the tailor’s wife, bed-ridden once more, had breathed her last. And then not even I had any choice but to ponder such business matters.The next morning, a few from our village saw his little body in the Yangtze, thrashing up against the current while kicking like a river dolphin in the water.And we had thought every baiji in the Yangtze had already passed away!Once, I saw him practising in the river. It was on a clear day, though this did not matter given the Yangtze’s murky nature. I was rushing from the market to see his father about a tear in my wife’s blouse when suddenly, I noticed the armless boy surging across the river. Lying on his back, his small body undulated as if he were a wave himself. At each crest, he lifted his head to take in new gulps of air – as if gasping for life – before sinking back beneath the water.At first I feared that the boy was drowning! But then as I watched him, I became transfixed by the smoothness of his rhythmic motion, his body moving effortlessly through the river like a long muscle. Perhaps it was only the sun playing tricks with these old eyes but in the bubbles formed by the water his body displaced, I began to imagine sinewy arms extending from his shoulders.So graceful and natural were the movements of his body in the Yangtze.‘Tell me old man: that boy in the river – he is not one of this village, is he?’ A deep and grating voice cut across my thoughts. I turned to see a stranger he stood leaning slightly towards the river, painting the First Wuhan Yangtze Bridge. He spread dabbles of colour upon white paper while continuing his musing. ‘Rather, he swims as if he belongs to the water itself.’What rudeness from this man to interrupt my silence! And he was not even from our village. ‘Yes, he is the son of my tailor – and he has no arms,’ I said. ‘You would do better to paint him instead.’‘Really, is that right?’ the visitor said. He stared at the Swimmer floating in the river. ‘He must have such strong legs.’Yes – this was true. But later, when I spoke with the tailor, he boasted that the secret lay not with his son’s legs, but rather his feet. It was this extraordinary skill with his toes which allowed the boy to brush his teeth and even pick up chopsticks to enjoy his favorite dishes of steamed wu-chang fish – or so the tailor told me.‘Why does he swim so often?’ I asked the boy’s father, after I arrived at his tailor shop. He replied that he did not know. Yet later, when the newspapers began to write about his son, he suddenly seemed confident of the reason.‘For the Communist government and our great Chairman Mao Zedong!’ Those words were quoted in his name and printed in the Chang Jiang Daily Press, under the headline ‘Boy with No Arms Swims across Yangtze’. Soon, reporters from other cities in Hubei province were travelling to Wuhan too to write about the Swimmer and one day, I even heard that a famous reporter from Xinhua Beijing had come to our train station.So much attention bestowed upon our humble village! Not since the grace of our Chairman’s swim in the Yangtze had we enjoyed such attention. From morning to dusk, reporters would crowd along the edge of the river to take photographs of the Swimmer practising his dolphin kicks in the cloudy water. At the beginning of this commotion, a few local boys – no doubt among them the no- good sons of Four-Eyes Ah-Fong and Shiny-Head Lao Cheng – followed the Swimmer into the river in hopes of being photographed too. But barely one week passed before those local boys gave up their foolish ambitions, as stories of the armless swimmer continued printing in every paper while their own faces remained unseen.Soon, the tailor’s son returned to being the only swimmer in the Yangtze.‘You are so lucky!’ every villager in Wuhan told the father. And indeed, before long, he became known as the most famous tailor in all of Hubei.Sometimes he would even reject business. ‘My son is the Swimmer of Yangtze,’ the tailor would say if he were tired. And because of this reputation, nobody he rejected was ever upset.One morning, I was eating a bowl of beef la-mian at Four-Eyed Ah-Fong’s noodle stand when suddenly, a great herd of running villagers spread news to our table that the Swimmer had gone missing. Immediately I released the chopsticks from my hand and rose from my wooden stool to look for Four-Eyed Ah-Fong and tell him that I would return to finish my noodles later – but already, that no-good noodle-stall operator had gone to the river to see for his own eyes!And behold: in the Yangtze, there was no Swimmer!‘What has befallen the Swimmer of Yangtze?’ everyone cried, circling the riverbank. More quietly, they asked: how would this impact business? For months, our stalls had been surging with profits because of tourists travelling from all over our country to see the Swimmer, and now we were afraid, for many of us had already expanded our shops to accommodate this traffic.‘All is well!’ a voice called out. From the riverbank, the familiar shape of a middle-aged man began walking towards our panicked crowd. And indeed, I knew I recognized his shadow: it was the tailor.‘Where is your son – the Swimmer of Yangtze? Is he ill?’ Four-Eyed Fong asked.‘Has he been kidnapped by some enemy of our village? Will he be back swimming soon?’ Shiny-Head Lao Cheng followed.A rumbling laugh exploded from the tailor, a sound I had never heard from him before in my many years visiting his shop. ‘My son, the Swimmer of Yangtze, is healthy and well. But he is not in Wuhan anymore – because the great Communist Party, led by our leader Chairman Mao, has summoned him to Beijing to swim for our People’s Republic!’At first, I was too shocked to speak. Would our great Communist Party, only twenty years after its heroic liberation of our country through heavy arms and fearless patriotism, truly call upon a boy with a history of neither? Even if that were true, would they make him disappear from our village in one day? Not possible!But then, as the tailor began to explain how Red Army comrades had arrived last night at his shop bearing important documents from Beijing, we suddenly noticed the brown sheet between his fingers. And after Four-Eyed Fong swung his arm around to snatch that paper from the tailor’s soft hands, that no-good noodle-stall operator unfurled the letter in the air for us to all see – and indeed there upon the brown paper was the signature of our Chairman Mao himself!Oh, what glorious pride I felt. ‘Will he be swimming for the international games?’ I asked.‘Yes!’ the tailor said. He would swim in the competition for swimmers with disabilities, which also happened every four years, and this made us no less proud.By the river that day, we showered the tailor with congratulations. And the next morning, when I brought over some meat and rice rations for the tailor, I saw a mountain of gifts piled up on the ground outside his shop, like an offering to the Holy Buddha himself!‘Home of the Great Swimmer of Yangtze’ the tailor had stitched onto a long piece of fabric, and fastened this onto his front door. And soon, even the mayor of Wuhan travelled down to the riverbank to meet the tailor and commission him to sew those same words upon a banner to be strung between the twin red pillars of the city’s dragon gate – so that all who walked underneath would know our village’s great honour.Three nights later when the mayor hoisted the banner high between the twin dragons, all of Wuhan erupted with the sound of firecrackers.In the summer of 1976, with business booming in our village beside Wuhan, Shiny-Head Lao Cheng bought the first television in town. He had timed this purchase perfectly, so that he could show off his electric box during the international games he knew we all wanted to watch.‘As a village, we will witness our great hero win – the Swimmer of Yangtze!’ he shouted, pointing at his small television. He had set it up outside his house in the town square near the red dragon gate and we cheered his generosity, as if the selfless spirit of Lei Feng had been reborn.On the eve of the swim, even the tailor came from the riverbank to watch. Shiny-Head Lao Cheng offered him the best chair in front of the television, while the rest of us crowded around elbowing one another for a better view of the black-and-white screen. Then, after too many hours of watching other competitions – for apparently those without limbs competed at many sports – we finally saw our hero in the pool. He was the only Chinese. In the water, our Swimmer jumped up and down, nodding his head vigorously at the crowd of foreigners for of course, he had no arms with which to wave and earn their cheers.But in our village and almost certainly all of Wuhan, we were shouting for only one swimmer, and that was the Swimmer of Yangtze!As the race was about to start, our hero placed both his feet against the wall and turned his back towards the other end of the pool. Ah, so he would be swimming backstroke. Pressed up to near-standing while facing the wall, the Swimmer held himself frozen in the air, clenching between his teeth a white towel held out by his Chinese coach who knelt upon the deck and stared into the boy’s eyes.Go Swimmer of Yangtze! I was so nervous that my arthritic hands began to cramp, but I did not mind.Then we heard the gunshot – and the Swimmer was pulsing through the water!‘Add oil, Swimmer of Yangtze!’ we cheered. There on the flickering black-and-white screen were the dolphin kicks we had seen him practise in the river then at the end of the wall, we saw him flip underwater and begin those kicks again!So what if most of his foreign competitors had one or even two working arms? They were cheaters! They used their legs as if they were swimming freestyle with single-arm strokes, but while the Swimmer kicked like a dolphin, none of them could gain a lead. And of course, for we had watched our hero practise those kicks in the Yangtze for many years, triumphing over its heavy current.Then, as we heard the cheers grow louder from the electric box – and oh, how marvellous was that foreign invention – we realized that the race was nearing its final stretch, and still the Swimmer of Yangtze was ahead!‘Add oil, our young hero!’ we cried out again. But then, we saw that our hero was starting to grow tired and slow – he was ahead now by no more than one half-stroke. And as the three fastest swimmers approached the final wall, the two foreigners behind our hero began to extend their limbs and so the Swimmer of Yangtze – and this I would not have believed without seeing with my own eyes – surged past both their outstretched arms by kicking full-speed ahead, and then rammed his head straight into the concrete wall!Holy Buddha, protect our Swimmer! A shiver shot through his body like an electric shock, and suddenly, it went limp. The Chinese coach, who had held out the towel for the Swimmer at the beginning of the race, immediately dove into the pool.For a second, our village fell silent.Then, a Chinese voice rang out from the electric box and we learned our dreams had come true – the Swimmer of Yangtze had won!All of us sitting down leaped up from our chairs in joy, while those standing jumped even higher! Some of us were crying, tears streaming down our faces a gold medal for China! Because of our brave hero from the village!Everyone except for the Swimmer’s father of course, who had wanted to hear news of his son’s health. But we all assured him that his son would be fine.‘He is a hero, so young and strong,’ we said, ‘Our Holy Buddha would never allow any harm to come to him.’ And soon enough, the electric box would pan out to show the armless boy lifting his head from the pool deck to smile at the camera, with little more than a bloody wound on his head, and every one of us shouted in the tailor’s ear, ‘See! Your son is fine!’Later, the Swimmer of Yangtze would stand on the highest podium step, between the two foreigners who had finished behind him. Then, a white man in a black suit – and we could tell from just watching the electric box that his garment’s fabric was finer than any the tailor could have fashioned – walked over to the podium to hang a moon-shaped medal over our hero’s neck. In his other hand, the white man held out a bouquet of flowers for a moment, the Swimmer seemed to pause and circle the pool with blinking eyes. Then he wordlessly took the bouquet into his mouth, clenching the stems of each young flower with his teeth, and folded over in a deep bow.Oh, how every heart in our village exploded in that moment with pride!A few months later, when the Swimmer arrived home to the Wuhan local train station, a group of us gathered outside in welcome. Around his neck, he wore the same medal which we had admired on the electric box except in real life, we saw how the metal shone underneath the sun and we whispered how it must have been made of real gold. That night, the mayor announced a spectacular ceremony in the town square, to celebrate the Swimmer’s glorious return.But it is true that even then, we could see that the boy’s head was not quite right. During the ceremony, he smiled a few times at us in the crowd, but his eyes looked glazed over and he would often shake his head from side to side without reason. Later, when I had asked his father when his son might return to Beijing, the tailor pretended not have heard me and then walked away!Such audacity and disrespect – to his elder no less! Worse yet, as that man was leaving, he was muttering soft things beneath his breath and if only he had been facing my better ear, I would have heard each word and then known how to scold him the best way.In the end, we never did see the boy float again in the Yangtze – although a crowd did gather by the river for many days after the ceremony in hopes of watching his triumphant return to the water, a glorious event which never happened.So this is the story of how the Swimmer of Yangtze became no longer a swimmer but rather a simple boy with no arms. For a long time afterwards though, the townsfolk still brought their business to the tailor, so that they could touch that gold medal his son still wore around his neck. But then one night, a group of thieves broke into the tailor’s house and stole that boy’s treasure while he lay asleep. And the next morning when the tailor awoke, he saw that the thieves had also cut that famous fabric which had hung above his door: the one which had read ‘Home of the Great Swimmer of Yangtze.’Over time, most of our village stopped going to that tailor shop, for we had heard a rumour that the Yangtze was polluted now and it would be bad for our children to breathe in the chemicals rising from the river. Still, once in a while, I would travel to that riverbank to bring the tailor a torn duvet from my wife. Sometimes on those visits, I would glimpse that armless boy sitting on the ground of his father’s shop, often wearing not even a white shirt upon his back while folding clothes with his toes. But whenever my eyes wandered to meet his, the boy would kick up to his feet with the same force I had once witnessed in the Yangtze River, and then run off! And so I was never able to exchange words with him – to ask why he never swam again for our glorious Party or answer any other mysteries for that matter.Recently though, I noticed that the wooden planks holding up the tailor shop were beginning to crack. Sitting down inside, I suggested to the tailor that he see Shiny-Head Lao Cheng to bargain for some cheap repairs. For a little while, I waited for his gratitude. But when the words I expected did not arrive, I repeated my advice more loudly.‘Do this,’ I said, ‘Before the river flood comes to wash your shop away.’ Still, that man did not answer! My old hands tightened.‘Have you lost your ears, tailor! Do you want to die?’A long pause followed my words. Then, the tailor tilted his head.‘If my son and I were to drown in the Yangtze,’ he said slowly, ‘Would such tragedy not only serve our village, to make its name more glorious?’How shocked I was to hear this blasphemy come from his mouth! Not only my hands, but now both my arms were shaking too as I stood, ready to shout foul curses at the tailor’s head.But then just as my lips began to part, I saw that boy with no arms, sitting once more in the dirt. Hunched over, he suddenly lifted his chest to reveal bare shoulders hemmed in by empty space then our eyes met and he paused his rising motion. Only this time, the boy did not run or swim away but instead twisted his head upwards, gasping for air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eca4a4726a5bcaa9f9c4666f27586f889988125/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1296afaaff8285023942bc933657007","title":"books of resistance the writers pushing for a revolution in australias refugee policies","story":"The government tries to stop stories from being told but a new wave of authors are rallying against injusticeIt is stinking hot and two trucks packed with people are heading towards the Indonesian coast, where a woefully inadequate fishing vessel will, the passengers hope, transport them to Australia.The people pack into the boats and soon all personal boundaries disappear. In exhaustion, and with little room on the vessel, wives fall asleep on other men’s shoulders, women cradle other people’s children and those who stay awake are floridly ill over the side.The boat fills with water and capsizes. The passengers scatter into the sea and our narrator clings to a piece of wood.Before we have even reached the hell and boredom and hopelessness of imprisonment on Manus Island, the author Behrouz Boochani is taking us on an amazing – and terrible – voyage.His memoir, No Friend But the Mountains, is one of several books released in recent months about Australia’s cruel asylum regime.Australia’s system is the envy of conservative governments and the scourge of human rights organisations. The stories emanating from within it range from the deeply personal narratives of people caught in the system to more forensic investigations of how the system is used for political ends (David Marr and Marian Wilkinson’s Dark Victory from 2003 comes to mind as a superb example of this).While the asylum issue has rolled through the Australian news cycle more or less continuously since the Tampa crisis in August 2001, the last couple of months in Australian publishing has seen a cascade of new books about the refugee experience.Recent and upcoming releases also include When Elephants Fight, a South Sudanese coming-of-age story by Majok Tulba (Hamish Hamilton) Tears for Tarshiha by Olfat Mahmoud (Wild Dingo Press), an autobiography about a stateless Palestinian refugee Always Another Country (Text), a memoir by Sisonke Msimang about being born in exile to South African freedom fighters and Unbreakable Threads by Emma Adams (Allen \u0026amp Unwin), detailing the author’s fight to free an unaccompanied Hazara boy from the Australian detention system and adopt him into her family.Rounding off the new release pile is the large-format Home, comprised of drawings by Syrian children, edited by the Australian artist Ben Quilty with a forward by Richard Flanagan.The standout of these is Boochani’s lyrical account of his journey and incarceration. Since 2013, the Kurdish journalist has been held in immigration detention on Manus by the Australian government. His book was tapped out in Farsi on a mobile phone, smuggled out via WhatsApp and text message, and then translated into English and published by Picador in August.So why the flood of books on this theme?Kelly Fagan, publisher of Unbreakable Threads at Allen \u0026amp Unwin, told  Australia that she didn’t believe the flood of books was evidence of a “growing trend” in publishing but rather that it was “reflective of pressing societal issues”.Australia’s detention regime is now unfortunately mature enough for stories to start emerging not just about the long-term, personal effects of the system, but also about its larger political underpinnings. By generating empathy, they serve as a potent political tool.And there is clearly an audience for these books.

I imagine it’s full of glamorous and fabulous people, so I am worried about fitting in. What should I do? Cara, by emailOh young neophyte, innocent little babe wandering into the dark wood! I read your letter and I see the words, but the sound in my head is that of Ariel the little mermaid, splashing about happily and carefree in the sea, but singing about how she wants to be where the people are, wants to see them dancing, walking around on those – what do you call them? Feeeeeeeet! (Note: you do not walk around on your feet at fashion week – you walk around on the newly re-issued Prada neon wedge sandals with patent leather flames coming off the back. Also, I realise that the Little Mermaid analogy makes me Ursula the sea witch and I’m OK with that. I’m just here to help you, you poor, unfortunate souls!)The first thing to stress is that fashion week is a very serious business event. It’s not just about champagne, OK? Fashion is a billion-dollar industry! Jobs! People! And clothes – everyone wears ’em! And anyone asking if perhaps there’s a better way to run this industry than making the world’s fashion press schlep to four random cities twice a year, take taxis all around those cities to even more random locations to see wildly expensive clothes, the majority of which will never be worn by anyone, with the front rows filled with celebrities, rather than the journalists, well, you just don’t get it, my friend. It’s all about creating an image of aspiration, yes? And aspiration sells clothes, and that leads to jobs and and and …Oh, forget it. Does anyone want to read another justification of fashion weeks? I would rather hand-wash my cerulean blue jumper. Let’s focus on your question, Cara: how to get through it. Now, it all depends on whether you want to be an alpha, a beta or a gamma. A gamma is someone who is happy to stay as anonymous and invisible as possible, and bravo to them – sitting quietly on the sidelines is underestimated, now that everyone wants to be the star of the show. You enjoy yourselves, gammas.The alphas and betas have different priorities. Sure, they are there to look at the clothes on the runway, but they are really there for people to look at THEM. They pick out three outfits every day – and another for the evening (they are not FARMERS, as 30 Rock’s Jack Donaghy would say) – and their entire sense of self hangs on whether a 19-year-old blogger photographs them for their streetstyle Tumblr and what seat a harassed PR put them in for the show.And yet the alpha and the beta are very different beasts. The beta cares and shows everyone they care the alpha cares, but pretends they do not. So, if the beta is photographed by streetstyle bloggers on her way into a fashion show, she will frantically hunt down that photo online and put it all over her social media (total beta move). The alpha, by contrast, will treat the style bloggers as pesky irritations, her eyes heavy with patient irritation as she explains to the panting masses whether her jumpsuit is from Chloé or Céline. Should anyone tell her later that her photo made it on to the front page of a popular fashion website, she will feign interest before turning away and pointedly not Googling said website.Then there’s the seating. By now, everyone (even the gammas – even the omegas!) knows that the row you are in is a reflection of how important you are considered to be. So, a beta will go through all of their invitations as soon as they arrive if they are anywhere other than the first row, they will have their assistant call up and scream at the PR. An alpha will not take their invitation out of its envelope until they arrive at the show venue. They will then simply take their seat in the fourth row and effect an air of such otherworldly indifference that it will be communicated telepathically to the nearest PR, who will rush over and put the alpha in the front row. All the while, the alpha will insist they really aren’t bothered. At this point, the beta will be booted out of their precious seat and moved to the dreaded second row to make room for the alpha, thus occasioning the mother of all beta meltdowns, which the alpha will ignore by gazing serenely at the runway.So all you need to do for fashion week, Cara, is to decide whether you are an alpha, a beta or a gamma. Good luck, my child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d710a2cd725b2cc294bc910539ddefcb690096b1/0_273_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08f8ef27235d0e0b76619c418d139153","title":"michael kors serves up sunshine and witticism at new york show spring summer 2019 collection","story":"Springsummer 2019 collection cuts through the fog with designer’s beach club vibeNew York in the fog was probably not what Michael Kors envisaged when he chose a pier as the location for his springsummer 2019 show. No matter. On Wednesday morning, the collection brought thoughts of better weather: this was Michael Kors on holiday.The designer likes to take a theme and run with it. In this case, that meant brights, sun hats, shorts, bikinis and even luggage tags. There were also towels, cashmere, for the fictional (but plausible) Michael Kors beach club. The soundtrack glided from Good Vibrations to Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini and Je T’aime.The models were erse across age, gender, ethnicity and size, with the plus-size Ashley Graham among them.The best outfits had a casual feel – a hoodie slung over a full skirt and crop top in matching 60s floral print a frilled polka-dot skirt worn with a denim jacket. Pastel sweaters were adorned with images of surfers catching a wave.At a preview, Kors, in his trademark black outfit clutching a green juice, said the collection was about “escape, optimism, looking at life in a positive way … every day we look at our phones, we have two much crazy news”. French Polynesia and Malibu were mentioned. Kors was keen to point out the increased ersity of the models in the show. “Fashion is embracing ersity, and now we have to show the world,” he said.The designer is a native New Yorker and a former judge on the US reality TV show Project Runway. He is also fond of a one-liner. Kors described an outfit with a bikini top, cashmere hoodie and wide-legged trousers as one that would take the wearer from “sand to soiree”, while the collection was a “Xanax for a complicated world”.The resurgence is also down to the shifting strategy of the brand. Once synonymous with accessible luxury, Michael Kors has reduced the number of retailers that stock the brand, the theory being that the more exclusive it is, the more people will invest in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00674539ce7ea13698386b7e37d1575a65557b55/0_330_5177_3107/master/5177.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cae32f2de9ed6599a8f8deb485183af 720w","title":"hold the dark review netflix jeremy saulnier riley keogh","story":"Alaska-set genre-hopping saga from the director of Green Room and Blue Ruin boasts effective set pieces but buckles under the weight of ambitionThere’s something rather ironic about director Jeremy Saulnier’s most ambitious and cinematic film to date premiering on Netflix. His previous work, from breakout moody revenge thriller Blue Ruin to grisly punks v neo-Nazis horror Green Room, has hardly been lacking in scope but with his latest, there’s a definite level up in terms of what he’s trying to achieve. In Hold the Dark, he moves between continents, time periods, viewpoints and genres, delivering inarguably his most audacious film to date (in a recent interview, he referred to its “epic scale”).The film starts with a disappearance. In a remote, ramshackle village in northern Alaska, Bailey is the third child to go missing, presumably taken and killed by nearby wolves. His mother Medora (Riley Keough) contacts retired naturalist and author Russell (Jeffrey Wright) after reading that he once killed a wolf, imploring him to bring her some sort of justice. The two develop a strange kinship, linked by loneliness, but as Russell investigates, he finds that things aren’t as they seem and when Medora’s husband Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård) returns from serving in Iraq, events reach a violent boiling point.If that synopsis sounds intentionally vague then trust me, it can’t be vague enough because one of the primary joys of actor-writer-director Macon Blair’s densely plotted script, based on the acclaimed novel by William Giraldi, is its uneasy unpredictability. To enjoy the film on its own terms, one should know very little about the mechanics going in. But while the shifts in genre, plot and location do prove intriguing for much of the film, they ultimately result in a feeling of mild dissatisfaction, the whole never quite the sum of its parts.Working from his first ever adapted screenplay, Saulnier and longtime creative partner Blair feel somewhat overawed by their source material, unsure how to squeeze such a weighty, difficult novel into a compelling two-hour runtime. Taken as inidual vignettes, there are some standout sequences, whether they’re eerily effective mood-setters or seat-edge set pieces of shock and awe. Saulnier, as he proved in the ferociously entertaining Green Room, is a skilled choreographer of both heart-pumping suspense and queasily well-realised violence and he engineers some fantastic jaw-dropping moments, including one unforgettably savage shootout.As shown in his previous films, Saulnier is fascinated by the breadline and those who live close to it and again he’s able to convey stark hardship while avoiding grotesquery and cliche. But he’s also wrestling with an almost fairytale level of mysticism and the tonal shift jars. The latter can feel like a way of easily explaining some of the less understandable decision-making and character motivations, despite them taking place in a grounded setting. As previously mentioned, there’s a lot going on and such eclecticism is sometimes wearying. The opaqueness that’s initially arresting doesn’t lead us to anywhere that’s quite as enthralling as we’d hope, the haunting mood wearing off during the confusing third act and a final emotional swerve not landing with the requisite impact.However, it’s a pleasure to see Wright, an ever-dependable actor who’s too often wasted, given a rare lead role and he’s on top form, quietly selling us on a man who clearly internalises so much. It’s a deeply felt performance and while the characters around him might suffer from far less depth, there are still impactful turns from Keough and James Badge Dale as the local sheriff. Hold the Dark is clearly an all-consuming passion project for Saulnier and for many directors, partnering with Netflix feels like a safe way to share one’s ultimate vision, the creative constraints far less restrictive yet the budget remaining expansive. But it can also lead to overindulgence, something we’ve also seen in Duncan Jones’s Mute, Darryl Hannah’s Paradox and David Michôd’s War Machine, and while it’s far, far better than any of those, it still feels messily unrefined. Saulnier’s film is filled with so much, too much, even, and given that a lot of it works, it’s frustrating that a lot of it doesn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e07a5f53a66eddb067dc01564d3cd0c34d260/492_0_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9b07e8fd228d8839096718ff39ee863","title":"the land of steady habits review netflix","story":"In Nicole Holofcener’s sixth feature, adapted from Ted Thompson’s 2014 novel, a man’s midlife crisis is rendered with tragicomic sincerityThe women of writer-director Nicole Holofcener’s films have often been described as “dysfunctional” or “complicated”, the most rote of the catchwords used to suggest a kind of tough-as-nails realism. They are women, frequently single, sharp-tongued and exasperating, who evoke Henrik Ibsen’s groundbreaking Nordic anti-heroines, Nora Helmer and Hedda Gabler and Helene Alving, and the comic neuroses of Woody Allen, of whom Holofcener has been called the female counterpart. Like some, but not all, of Allen’s women – I’m thinking of Judy Davis in Husbands and Wives, Mia Farrow in The Purple Rose of Cairo and, of course, Diane Keaton in Annie Hall – Holofcener’s protagonists are flawed, wry, introspective and modern. They’re easy to love on-screen, if less so to the people they’re on-screen with.The Land of Steady Habits, Holofcener’s sixth feature film, an adaptation of Ted Thompson’s novel of the same name, is the first in which her lead is a man. It’s also the first that doesn’t include Catherine Keener, which is unfortunate if only because she’s been such a perfect vehicle and proxy for the director’s brand caustic, lifelike comedy. In this new film, a droll, sad and relentlessly truthful study of suburban ennui, Holofcener has turned her attention toward Anders Hill, a recently orced, standard-issue sad dad played with sublime self-pity by the Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn.When we meet Anders he has left his job in finance, which he righteously calls a “system of monstrous greed”, and is hiding the fact that he hasn’t paid the mortgage for six months on the house he let his ex Helene (Edie Falco) keep in their orce. Not five minutes into the movie, he’s accidentally smoked angel dust with a bunch of teenagers in her backyard. He’ll later find out his shrink was there to witness it.In quitting his job, leaving his wife and moving out of his house, Anders is looking to break the steady habits of the film’s title, a centuries-old moniker for Connecticut derived from the state’s pattern of electing the same people to public office. But like so many middle-agers who fancy acts of radical self-reinvention, he ends up turning to booze, strip clubs and other single friends like Larry, played by a hilariously morose Josh Pais. As Anders blunders drunkenly into his ex-wife’s home and finds fellowship with a friend’s drug-addicted son (an impressive and mumble-spoken Charlie Tahan), one can quickly sense this is not so much a Kierkegaardian leap of faith as it is an abdication of responsibility. And while Mendelsohn doesn’t play self-sabotage as charmingly as Julia Louis-Dreyfus did in Holofcener’s indelible last effort Enough Said, he’s still an object of empathy, a defining characteristic of the figures who populate the director’s body of work.The Land of Steady Habits is ultimately about people pretending not to want things they want: security, companionship, drugs, alcohol, normalcy. Holofcener’s characters are prideful to a fault, always lying to one another, though never out of malice. Funny, then, that her films are so bracingly honest. In one scene, Anders lies in bed next to Barbara (Connie Britton) and makes fun of the self-help book on her nightstand, cornily titled Live Your Best Life Today.“What is it with you women and these books?” he asks, an obviously idiotic and yet foreseeable thing for the rudderless orcee to say to the one woman in his life he’s managed not to alienate. “Are you in my bed, making fun of my book?” she replies. Realizing his faux pas, he tucks himself under the covers and attempts a meager recovery: “I’m sorry. You deserve your best life today.” “I know,” she says, their evening clearly spoiled. “That’s why I bought the fucking book.”Holofcener writes dialogue, suffused with barbed wit and quiet resentments, that’s deeply insightful though not necessarily cerebral. To say her characters talk like real people doesn’t quite capture it they talk like themselves, which is a testament to the director’s intuitive grasp of tone and characterization. Holofcener has called Luis Buñuel, the master of absurdist bourgeois satire, an influence. However, unlike Buñuel, whose best films (The Exterminating Angel, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie) lampoon the conventions of upper-middle class life, Holofcener’s satire is of a gentler, more generous sort. There are occasional histrionics – in Friends With Money, Frances McDormand throws an unforgettable tantrum in the Gap in Steady Habits, the great Michael Gaston stamps out a cigar on Anders’ forehead – but the comedy of manners is always counter-balanced by a comedy of melancholy.Take, for instance, a scene where Anders gets high with Charlie, his son Preston’s (Thomas Mann) friend. Anders says something crude and boyish about a woman’s breasts. You think the twentysomething’s going to one-up him with smut, but he sighs. “My mom’s got these, like, veiny yoga mom arms and they make me want to cry,” he says, before ranting about his dad’s usage of the non-word “irregardless”. Conversations proceed with a rhythm and ambivalence that’s both funny and sad, without artificiality or look-at-me realism.Because this is primarily the story of a single dad, there’s not enough of either Connie Britton or Edie Falco, whose Helene is warm and resolute. That you could imagine their characters front and center in a different Holofcener film speaks to how well and fully they’re wrought, even as they appear sparingly. The Land of Steady Habits, though not as funny and breezy as Enough Said or Friends With Money or Please Give, is a natural extension of Holofcener’s work, the totality of which is, in part, a rebuke of the idea that likability is necessary or even desirable in film characters. Her characters, rather, are acquired tastes, women (and, now, men) for whom we first have understanding, and then compassion, and then eventually, after they’ve made a royal mess of their lives, a kind of involuntary warmth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c3ef2062205e48dcf20a199ae773601d11a9d5/509_979_3257_1953/master/3257.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d246850147354e2c3c8222428a14570","title":"fenella fielding a life in pictures","story":"The actor, who has died aged 90, is best known for her Carry On roles but also boasted an illustrious stage career"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf839078ef91536fa3cd302fe3eec5dd8a6f2088/0_87_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d0d32cc68e3a086963dd477837b742","title":"faddy eater caul fat sausage wrapping membrane","story":"The heatwave is dead, long live autumn. Which means we are due something fatty. I love butter and, until recently, coconut oil – although I stopped eating it after a Harvard professor called it “poison”. Caul fat isn’t new, but after a colleague (who once worked for a butcher) told me that “if you like faggots, you’ll like caul fat”, I started seeing it everywhere.Caul fat is mostly used as a casing for faggots and sausages, and comes listed under all sorts of exotic-sounding monikers, such as lace fat, crépine and fat netting. On menus, it goes largely uncredited, possibly because it is a membrane that surrounds an animal’s internal organs, but it is clearly the prettiest fat in the genre. By and large, fat tends to be a thick, white, inert grease. Stretched out like clingfilm, caul fat looks like Brussels lace.One of its main uses is in sheftalia, a traditional Greek sausage made from ground pork, lamb, onion and parsley. Emilio Stavrou, a second-generation Greek Cypriot, serves them at Éla, his two month-old restaurant which sits at the back of St John at Hackney Brewery. The east London brewery is named after the nearby church and fitted with real pews, but while the acoustics inside might be comparable to a chapel, that is where the similarity ends. At the back, Stavrou and his team quietly grill halloumi and meat for a congregation glazed on craft ale.Under the light of an iPhone, Stavrou gently wraps the outstretched caul fat around a ball of mince to make the sausage. Prepared, it is the size of a baby’s hand, but shrinks a little when grilled. He serves it on its own in a small dish for £5. Dan Doherty is soon to start serving game faggots made with caul fat at the Royal Oak in Marylebone in central London. Meanwhile, it’s wrapped around the pulled lamb at the Cartford Inn, near Preston in Lancashire, and around chorizo at Brixton’s Smoke \u0026amp Salt.Stavrou spent his childhood summers eating the stuff in Lakatamia, Cyprus, with his grandmother. She would make the Greek version of a full English: curled cucumbers sliced and salted, loukanika sausages and smoked ham. Towards the end of breakfast, she would stand up and get the barbecue going for lunch.The fat, Stavrou says, is what makes his sausages so delicious it’s the flip to the synthetic sausage casing we are used to. He is not shy about a kebab in the early hours, but he is keen to push this traditional food to a more elevated level. Hackney is a good place to start. Since Cypriots started arriving as Commonwealth citizens in the 1950s and 60s, it has become something of a heartland for this sort of food.The key is not to fear the fat. In truth, you can’t actually taste it. It’s there, though, holding the whole thing together like Alastair Cook. You just can’t see it until it has gone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc088edcf1c0214146a0ea496cd35f310f27357/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=651f323398943e0fae280c3dde1e041d","title":"chelsea womens champions league cruise","story":"Chelsea made a convincing start to their Women’s Champions League campaign with a 5-0 win against SFK 2000 in the first leg of their last-32 tie in Sarajevo.

Southgate made sure not to say anything that could be perceived as critical of Pep Guardiola, but the England manager believes it is part of a wider problem that is squeezing out some of the country’s better players.“The landscape is what it is and I understand the difficulties club managers have. They have to try to win matches. It is not as straightforward for Pep as: ‘Oh, I’ll just give Phil a game.’ Every decision you make as a manager has a knock-on effect and I understand how complicated that is. But it is a difficult landscape for us.”Southgate did not take issue when it was put to him that Loftus-Cheek and Delph looked rusty in the 1-0 win over Switzerland at Leicester on Tuesday. “We are hoping that now we have given them some minutes they will go back to their club better prepared for when they get their opportunity and it gives them a better chance of staying in the team. They are going to have the League Cup and European football, so there’s more opportunity that the squads will get rotated. But if we are in a similar situation next month – three weeks into the season is one thing, but seven weeks and they have not played? It is even more complicated.”Dominic Solanke, another of Southgate’s favourites, has yet to feature for Liverpool this season. Southgate also expressed concerns about the fact Jack Butland now plays in the Championship with Stoke and even Marcus Rashford, England’s scorer in their past two games, is not a regular for Manchester United, with only one Premier League start this season.Rashford’s contribution to the games against Switzerland and Spain has reopened the debate about whether the 20-year-old should keep his place alongside Harry Kane as England’s second striker instead of Raheem Sterling. However, Southgate floated the idea of trying to fit all three into the same side, an idea that would probably mean Sterling switching to another position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e2e4a7ea3cebd67044637dd86a3cc140fbdce1/0_1_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e80505016709f7b874547c5fe5b2242","title":"the nations league and wycombes marcus bean football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Wycombe midfielder Marcus Bean to discuss the home nations, Nicklas Bendtner’s latest scrape, Ryan Babel’s return and Adil Rami’s proposal misfireJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

We round up some other big results before turning our attention to Leagues One and Two, and a brief e into Marcus’s career, including the best player he played with at youth level, how he came to score Wycombe’s 2017-18 goal of the season and how it was missed by his parents, who had left the game early to beat the traffic. Back on Thursday! PS: we’re heading to Oslo on 19 September. Find all the information you need here.

But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesI want to reclaim the St George’s Cross and St George’s Day. Both the flag and the occasion are things that should represent English people, and it’s sad to see how they have been taken over by the far right for the last couple of decades.With Brexit and the current political climate, England feels vulnerable and if we’re not careful, people on the far right will take that as their victory. I think it would be a great signal of unity for the centre and left to take up national pride and not be scared of saying they’re proud of England. Of course there are problems with England’s history. But St George’s Day could be such a powerful symbol, such a strong piece of artillery. National pride can be used as a strength, to create community.It’s time for us to speak up and be loud – to push the idea of the flag to include a erse crowd, to represent what England represents for many people: tolerance and ersity. The definition of what it is to be English has to change and represent the modern day: not just a white man in middle England, but people from all different backgrounds who don’t have to explain why they’re English. There are a lot of people who say they’re English and like England but they don’t feel comfortable flying the flag because of the connotations. But during the World Cup this year, it felt like such a moment of unity. All of a sudden everybody was dusting off their flags and happy to fly them. We were in it together, just really wanting England to win. That may have been the only thing that people had in common but that was enough. I want to build on that moment, and to make it so that people don’t feel it’s only during sporting events that we’re allowed to be patriotic.I was thinking of starting a digital campaign, with public figures showing the flag on social media, maybe in a video, talking about what England means to them. It would be great if we could encourage people nationwide to have little street parties that are inclusive, or to invite their neighbours round, or to get everyone to post their favourite English song.I want to have the hashtag #StretchTheFlag, inspired by Riz Ahmed’s interview on BBC Two’s Road to Englistan where he referenced a quote from Zadie Smith: “All I want to do with my work is to take words like black, British or woman and stretch them so they’re big enough so I can live in them comfortably.”The voice from far right is so loud right now that unless we do something to speak up it will take this moment for its own. Most people are not racist. But tolerant, erse England doesn’t have a symbol to represent it.We should be able to celebrate St George’s Day, too, and I’d appreciate any advice on how to do that.Community organisers are used to tackling huge issues like this, and like you, they start small – down to a day, a feeling, a symbol. You also need to think about exactly what it is that you’re trying to achieve: uniting people is very different from, say, opening up a public debate, or wanting a different group of people to be seen to be reclaiming St George’s Day (which is also very different from wanting a different group of people to feel national pride).Sara Bryson, Citizen UK’s Tyne \u0026amp Wear community organiser, suggests thinking about power next: “We rarely have positional power, but what people power do you have? Do you know somebody who knows somebody? Who do you need to get to? What action do you want to take? What reaction do you want it to achieve?”These actions, says Bryson, need to be very directed – down to naming the person who has the authority to do something about what you are aiming to achieve.People power is also about having a following. You want this to be a cross-cultural event that unites different groups – to some of whom you won’t currently have access. They may not hang out where you do. Maybe they don’t use the same online platforms. But you need to understand what they want, what their fears are, and whether they care enough to join in. Do you know how different demographics feel about St George’s Day? Have you asked them? Would they ever come to a party where someone hung the flag? Why? Why not?“Building a campaign isn’t just mobilising people. It’s not just saying, ‘I have these ideas about reclaiming St George’s Day.’ It’s about approaching people with a blank piece of paper and hearing them out. Finding out what their problems are and what they want to see change,” says Bryson.Phil Chapman, director of multi-faith charity the Faith \u0026amp Belief Forum, warns that the campaign may not be as uniting as you hope: “Some saw Brexit as an opportunity to vent about the way they were treated in society. People were polarised over whose country this is. Fighting over a flag could be the same.”I personally think it depends. You’ve come up with a nice idea that you hope will bring people together, and have some good ideas about how to get it started. That doesn’t necessarily have to involve all people – it could just be your friends. The most important thing is to take into account the views of those who may feel alienated by it, on the left and the right.• What do you think?

Experts and  readers give their best adviceWe all know we should be doing more, but how do we keep moving when our motivation slips, the weather takes a turn for the worse or life gets in the way? Try these 25 pieces of advice from experts and  readers to keep you going.Our reasons for beginning to exercise are fundamental to whether we will keep it up, says Michelle Segar, the director of the University of Michigan’s Sport, Health and Activity Research and Policy Center. Too often “society promotes exercise and fitness by hooking into short-term motivation, guilt and shame”. There is some evidence, she says, that younger people will go to the gym more if their reasons are appearance-based, but past our early 20s that doesn’t fuel motivation much. Nor do vague or future goals help (“I want to get fit, I want to lose weight”). Segar, the author of No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness, says we will be more successful if we focus on immediate positive feelings such as stress reduction, increased energy and making friends. “The only way we are going to prioritise time to exercise is if it is going to deliver some kind of benefit that is truly compelling and valuable to our daily life,” she says.The danger of the typical New Year resolutions approach to fitness, says personal trainer Matt Roberts, is that people “jump in and do everything – change their diet, start exercising, stop drinking and smoking – and within a couple of weeks they have lost motivation or got too tired. If you haven’t been in shape, it’s going to take time.” He likes the trend towards high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and recommends people include some, “but to do that every day will be too intense for most people”. Do it once (or twice, at most) a week, combined with slow jogs, swimming and fast walks – plus two or three rest days, at least for the first month. “That will give someone a chance of having recovery sessions alongside the high-intensity workouts.”It is helpful not to try to make yourself do things you actively dislike, says Segar, who advises thinking about the types of activities – roller-skating? Bike riding? – you liked as a child. But don’t feel you have to really enjoy exercise. “A lot of people who stick with exercise say: ‘I feel better when I do it.’” There are elements that probably will be enjoyable, though, such as the physical response of your body and the feeling of getting stronger, and the pleasure that comes with mastering a sport.“For many people, the obvious choices aren’t necessarily the ones they would enjoy,” says Sniehotta, who is also the director of the National Institute for Health Research’s policy research unit in behavioural science, “so they need to look outside them. It might be different sports or simple things, like sharing activities with other people.”Inidual motivation – or the lack of it – is only part of the bigger picture. Money, parenting demands or even where you live can all be stumbling blocks, says Sniehotta. Tiredness, depression, work stress or ill family members can all have an impact on physical activity. “If there is a lot of support around you, you will find it easier to maintain physical activity,” he points out. “If you live in certain parts of the country, you might be more comfortable doing outdoor physical activity than in others. To conclude that people who don’t get enough physical activity are just lacking motivation is problematic.”Segar suggests being realistic. “Skip the ideal of going to the gym five days a week. Be really analytical about work and family-related needs when starting, because if you set yourself up with goals that are too big, you will fail and you’ll feel like a failure. At the end of a week, I always ask my clients to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Maybe fitting in a walk at lunch worked, but you didn’t have the energy after work to do it.”“If you need willpower to do something, you don’t really want to do it,” says Segar. Instead, think about exercise “in terms of why we’re doing it and what we want to get from physical activity. How can I benefit today? How do I feel when I move? How do I feel after I move?”Anything that allows you to exercise while ticking off other goals will help, says Sniehotta. “It provides you with more gratification, and the costs of not doing it are higher.” For instance, walking or cycling to work, or making friends by joining a sports club, or running with a friend. “Or the goal is to spend more time in the countryside, and running helps you do that.”Try to combine physical activity with something else. “For example, in my workplace I don’t use the lift and I try to reduce email, so when it’s possible I walk over to people,” says Sniehotta. “Over the course of the day, I walk to work, I move a lot in the building and I actually get about 15,000 steps. Try to make physical activity hit as many meaningful targets as you can.”When you take up running, it can be tiring just getting out of the door – where are your shoes? Your water bottle? What route are you going to take? After a while, points out Sniehottta, “there are no longer costs associated with the activity”. Doing physical activity regularly and planning for it “helps make it a sustainable behaviour”. Missing sessions doesn’t.What if you don’t have time to exercise? For many people, working two jobs or with extensive caring responsibilities, this can undoubtedly be true, but is it genuinely true for you? It might be a question of priorities, says Sniehotta. He recommends planning: “The first is ‘action planning’, where you plan where, when and how you are going to do it and you try to stick with it.” The second type is ‘coping planning’: “anticipating things that can get in the way and putting a plan into place for how to get motivated again”. Segar adds: “Most people don’t give themselves permission to prioritise self-care behaviours like exercise.”A workout doesn’t have to take an hour, says Roberts. “A well-structured 15-minute workout can be really effective if you really are pressed for time.” As for regular, longer sessions, he says: “You tell yourself you’re going to make time and change your schedule accordingly.”It rains for a week, you don’t go running once and then you feel guilty. “It’s a combination of emotion and lack of confidence that brings us to the point where, if people fail a few times, they think it’s a failure of the entire project,” says Sniehotta. Remember it’s possible to get back on track.If previous exercise regimes haven’t worked, don’t beat yourself up or try them again – just try something else, he says. “We tend to be in the mindset that if you can’t lose weight, you blame it on yourself. However, if you could change that to: ‘This method doesn’t work for me, let’s try something different,’ there is a chance it will be better for you and it prevents you having to blame yourself, which is not helpful.”“We start to lose muscle mass over the age of around 30,” says Hollie Grant, a personal training and pilates instructor, and the owner of PilatesPT. Resistance training (using body weight, such as press-ups, or equipment, such as resistance bands) is important, she says: “It is going to help keep muscle mass or at least slow down the loss. There needs to be some form of aerobic exercise, too, and we would also recommend people start adding balance challenges because our balance is affected as we get older.”“If you do 5k runs and you don’t know if you should push faster or go further, rate your exertion from one to 10,” says Grant. “As you see those numbers go down, that’s when to start pushing yourself a bit faster.” Roberts says that, with regular exercise, you should be seeing progress over a two-week period and pushing yourself if you feel it is getting easier. “You’re looking for a change in your speed or endurance or strength.”If you have caring responsibilities, Roberts says you can do a lot within a small area at home. “In a living room, it is easy to do a routine where you might alternate between doing a leg exercise and an arm exercise,” he says. “It’s called Peripheral Heart Action training. Doing six or eight exercises, this effect of going between the upper and lower body produces a pretty strong metabolism lift and cardiovascular workout.” Try squats, half press-ups, lunges, tricep dips and glute raises. “You’re raising your heart rate, working your muscles and having a good general workout.” These take no more than 15-20 minutes and only require a chair for the tricep dips – although dumbbells can be helpful, too.We are often told that housework and gardening can contribute to our weekly exercise targets, but is it that simple? “The measure really is you’re getting generally hot, out of breath, and you’re working at a level where, if you have a conversation with somebody while you’re doing it, you’re puffing a bit,” says Roberts. “With gardening, you’d have to be doing the heavier gardening – digging – not just weeding. If you’re walking the dog, you can make it into a genuine exercise session – run with the dog, or find a route that includes some hills.”Joslyn Thompson Rule, a personal trainer, says: “The general rule is if it’s above the neck – a headache or a cold – while being mindful of how you’re feeling, you are generally OK to do some sort of exercise. If it’s below the neck – if you’re having trouble breathing – rest. The key thing is to be sensible. If you were planning on doing a high-intensity workout, you would take the pace down, but sometimes just moving can make you feel better.” After recovering from an illness, she says, trust your instincts. “You don’t want to go straight back into training four times a week. You might want to do the same number of sessions but make them shorter, or do fewer.”Clearly, how quickly you start exercising again depends on the type of injury, and you should seek advice from your doctor. Psychologically, though, says Thompson Rule: “Even when we’re doing everything as we should, there are still dips in the road. It’s not going to be a linear progression of getting better.”For goal-oriented people, Grant says, it can be useful to monitor progress closely, but “allow some flexibility in your goals. You might have had a stressful day at work, go out for a run and not do it as quickly and then think: ‘I’m just not going to bother any more.’” However, “It can start to get a bit addictive, and then you don’t listen to your body and you’re more at risk of injury.” “Winter is not necessarily a time to hibernate,” says Thompson Rule. Be decisive, put your trainers by the door and try not to think about the colddrizzlegreyness. “It’s the same with going to the gym – it’s that voice in our head that make us feel like it’s a hassle, but once you’re there, you think: ‘Why was I procrastinating about that for so long?’”I’ve tried and failed a few times to establish a consistent running routine, but that was because I kept pushing myself too hard. Just because I can run for an hour doesn’t mean I should. Running two or three times a week for 20-30 minutes each time has improved my fitness hugely and made it easier to fit in. I keep a large bag of Midget Gems in my car to motivate myself to get to the gym, allowing myself a handful before a workout. Sometimes I toss in some wine gums for the element of surprise.I tapped into the vast network of fitness podcasts and online communities. On days I lacked drive, I would listen to a fitness podcast, and by the time I got home, I would be absolutely determined to make the right choices. In fact, I would be excited by it. Your brain responds very well to repetition and reinforcement, so once you have made the difficult initial change, it becomes much easier over time. I have kept a “star chart” on my calendar for the past two years, after having three years of being chronically unfit. I put a gold star on days that I exercise, and it’s a good visual motivator for when I am feeling slug-like. I run, use our home cross-trainer and do a ski fitness programme from an app. My improved core strength has helped my running and ability to carry my disabled child when needed.If, like me, you need to get up early to exercise or it just doesn’t happen, move your alarm clock away from your bed and next to your kit. Once you have got up to turn it off, you might as well keep going!I have one simple rule which could apply to any fitness activity – I do not allow more than four days to elapse between sessions. So, if I know I have a busy couple of days coming up, I make sure I run before them so that I have “banked” my four days. With the exception of illness, injury or family emergencies, I have stuck to this rule for 10 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb42c2592fd3dbc5c5fbc1f9af8e102047dec93/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=aae05f272f82a7871480a9cb8da73714","title":"guardian writers favourite kate bush lyrics book","story":"As Kate Bush announces a book of her collected lyrics,  writers pick out their favourite lines from across her careerI’ve got everything I needI’ve got petrol in the carI’ve got some money with meThere’s just one problemYou’re the only one I wantIt’s easy to overlook this breakup ballad. The album it’s taken from – The Red Shoes – contains Rubberband Girl and Why Should I Love You?, which brazenly combines Prince and Lenny Henry. But You’re the One, the album’s closer, takes a straightforward story of two people breaking up and turns it into the equal of Nothing Compares 2 U, when it comes to a big bombastic statement about heartbreak. The lyrics, which start with the strangely functional (“It’s alright, I’ll come round when you’re not in”) are the key to its success, as Bush slowly and tragically admits to being unable to function without her lover. Bush’s own long-term relationship with bassist Del Palmer had come to an end before the album was recorded, while her mother and guitarist Alan Murphy also died in the lead up to the album’s release. That loss is sprinkled all over the song but these lyrics,in an instant, capture how putting a brave face on things can’t outrun the pain of grief. Lanre BakareBut every time it rainsYou’re here in my headLike the sun coming outOoh, I just know that something good is gonna happenI first heard this during the lowest point of my life. I had recently graduated but – to misquote Morrissey – couldn’t get a job even if I wanted one my mother had just died and I lived alone in our childhood semi-detached council house on a diet of KitKats and baked beans. I was at my most miserable when I joined a mail order music service called the Britannia Music Club: signing up (however briefly) meant you got three free albums. There wasn’t a vast choice but I got Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s Greatest Hits, Prince’s Sign O’ the Times and Kate Bush’s Hounds of Love, and devoured each intensely. Cloudbusting – Hounds’ second single - is actually about the relationship between psychologistphilosopher Wilhelm Reich and his son, Peter, and in particular their time spent together making a rain-making machine – a Cloudbuster – but these lines spoke to me and offered a bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Each time I heard it, I instantly felt better: about myself, the future, everything. Gradually, I realised that the singer was singing about a father, whose memory lingered on, and I related to that too. My own father died when I was six, but one of my abiding memories of him is of how he left a new word for me every day on a blackboard before he went to work, which meant I could spell by the time I got to school. All this came together when an exasperated dole mate, Paul, said, “Look, all you’re interested in is music. Why don’t you write about music?” and a light bulb went on above my head. I clambered out of the tunnel, never to return. Thank you Dad, thank you – wherever you are – Paul, and thank you Kate. Dave SimpsonThis sense of humour of mineIt isn’t funny at allOh, but we sit up all nightTalking about itAside from being six minutes of gorgeous piano work backed by an orchestra, arranged by Michael Kamen, Bush’s Moments of Pleasure is among her lyrically strongest works thanks to its lightness of touch. Mostly inspired by the grief that came after multiple people close to her had died, there are vignettes of memory the titular moments of pleasure (“I think about us  lying on a beach somewhere”). But it’s this lyric that I go back to. I’d hate to say these lines stand out for me as someone who absolutely copes with the darkest of events using awkward jokes and black humour, much explored by frustrated therapists and partners, but, well … that is why. No idea if this is true, but I’ve heard the line was inspired by a technician who accidentally wiped a finished track from The Dreaming: “God, I couldn’t stop laughing”. You gotta laugh or you’ll cry, right? Hannah Jane ParkinsonWe let the weirdness inThe Dreaming isn’t Kate Bush’s best album, but it remains my favourite there’s something very beguiling about the sound of an artist finally letting their imagination fully run riot. Not that Kate Bush’s imagination was ever terribly constrained, but The Dreaming is marked by the sense that sampling technology had now enabled her to fully recreate the sounds in her head, and that she was now successful enough to please no-one other than herself. That’s what Leave It Open seems to be about: a confession that things hadn’t always been done the way she would have liked – “narrow mind would persecute it, die a little just to get to it” – and an announcement that they will be from now on. There’s something really moving about the way the lyrics make the listener complicit, drawing you in to her increasingly weird world: it’s not confrontational but trusting, it ends with a repeated invocation not of “I”, but “we let the weirdness in”. The pronoun seems important, as if she knows that anyone left after this is in it with her for the long haul. Alexis PetridisI stand outside this woman’s workThis woman’s worldOoh, it’s hard on the manThe idea of pregnancy being hard on the man … blimey, do we really want to go there? As someone who witnessed his tough cookie of a wife doubled up in agony while emitting sonorous groans and accusing her loving husband of conspiring with the midwives to deny her pain relief, I’m not sure now (or ever) is the time. Yet the partner’s experience of childbirth undeniably provides its own unique brand of torture – not least in the sheer powerlessness you feel. The act of watching biology whirl around you while you can do nothing but “pray God you can cope” and try not to let your tears show is something many men will have felt. I doubt any will ever express it as eloquently as Bush, though. Tim JonzeI should be crying, but I just can’t let it showI should be hoping, but I can’t stop thinkingOf all the things I should’ve said that I never saidAll the things we should’ve done though we never didFor me this song speaks of grief of finding out that life is not infinite, relationships don’t always last and at some point everything you’ve wanted to say to someone dissolves it’s too late, and time has moved on without you. It is a song that demands courage – to speak up, to stand up, to travel, to see everything and do everything because life has a way of disrupting plans. Of course it is a sad song, but sadness here is a driver – a way of moving forward and pushing for more. Jenny StevensThey say no, no it won’t last foreverAnd here I am again my girlWondering what on earth I am doing hereMaybe he doesn’t love meI just took a trip on my love for himI’m a strange kind of music fan: I don’t really notice lyrics. There are songs that make my heart swell and glow, but I can only pick out odd words, or quote just the occasional line that floats to the surface. Maybe that’s why Kate Bush’s The Man With the Child in His Eyes is the track I think of now. Piano, cello and voice, barely three minutes long, with whispered lines that seem to come from a half-remembered dream, it’s so simple and direct it felt like something I’d always known.Bush wrote this song at 14 or 15, and recorded it at 16, the age I too was spinning secret dreams of being cherished and simply understood in the way her lyrics spoke of. Its absence of cynicism makes it a song that could only be written by a young teenager, from its anxious intensity as it lurches from declarations of eternal love to, “Maybe he doesn’t love me”, and its us-against-the-world story: “They say no, no, it won’t last”. I yearned for someone to tell me about the sea. All the boys I knew just had bad hair, spots and made stupid jokes about the size of your breasts. And, to misquote another great work of art that sustained my teenage years, The Princess Bride, this wasn’t a song about kissing (yuck), this was about something deeper, purer. I wonder if I was also obliquely glimpsing the pain and vulnerability I saw but could not directly acknowledge in my father, as my parents’ marriage broke up that same year. Bush’s songs soundtracked that period of my life, which is why today The Man With the Child in His Eyes makes me think of my father, which is why I still cherish it. Imogen TildenMy mother And her little brown jugIt held her milkThe power of Bush’s lyrics is often found in the way she telescopes between fantastical visions and intimate detail, and this is a perfect example. Coming at the end of disc one of 2005 double album Aerial – a series of character studies including Elvis, Joan of Arc and her son – is this song about Bush’s mother. It begins with a weird reverie, seeing a cityscape and even a battlefield in a bunch of fishing paraphernalia, but just as Bush gets carried off by her daydream, it’s as if something triggers a long-forgotten memory. The world contracts to a room. Like all our most powerful memories, it is an incredibly simple image, and yet so redolent of nursing and nurture. This is one of the most intensely poignant moments in Bush’s catalogue, all the more so for how the clarity of the memory is crowded out by her reverie rushing back in again. Reminiscent of Eliot’s “Marie, Marie, hold on tight. And down we went” from The Waste Land, it is one of those moments in life where you’re transported back to childhood, all our experience and language collapsing into innocence and need. With this song, Bush makes children of us all. Ben Beaumont-ThomasHello, I know that you’ve been feeling tiredI bring you love and deeper understandingHello, I know that you’re unhappyI bring you love and deeper understandingBush wrote Deeper Understanding before I was even born, and a decade before MSN Messenger and LiveJournal turned after-school hours into opportunities to share your darkest secrets with strangers you only knew by their asl. And yet, despite coming from a more primitive time – the internet newly born as a niche concern – it is the most empathetic and accurate song I’ve ever heard about the relationship between humans and computers. (Ever wise, Bush also predicted the addictive nature of playing the Sims: “Nothing else seemed to matter  I neglected my bodily needs.”)It’s a hard balance to strike – the past five years or so have spawned countless songs about that bond, many of them preachy or facile. There is no judgment in Bush’s beautiful song: the user’s family may intervene, but still, they’re lonely and lost. It reminds me of another of my favourite Bush lyrics, from Hounds of Love – “I’m ashamed of running away  From nothing real  I just can’t deal with this  But I’m still afraid to be there” – about how hard it can be to submit to human intimacy. Is this “deeper understanding” a simulation or a true salve? Couldn’t it be both? Laura Snapes• Which Bush lyrics would you nominate for inclusion in How to Be Invisible?

Rihanna herself joined them for a finale, drawing much whooping from the crowd.At show like this, clothes aren’t really the point but, for the record, these had a louche, decadent vibe with lots of coloured satin and leopard print. Interpretations of underwear ranged from sports bras to full-on basques.When Rihanna launched Savage x Fenty, it swiftly sold out both online and in stores. This show aimed to keep up the heat, with a livestream broadcast on YouTube and some pieces available to buy after the show.Savage x Fenty follows Fenty Beauty, a makeup line which launched in 2017 and saw queues of women outside Harvey Nichols in London. Both brands champion ersity and body positivity, with Savage x Fenty available in seven “nude” shades and up to a 44DD cup size. Like the show, the initial advertising campaign for the brand featured a range of skin colours and sizes.Female empowerment is the zeitgeist-friendly message of the musician’s underwear range. “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she said to US Vogue in May. “I want people to wear Savage x Fenty and think: I’m a bad bitch. I want women to own their beauty.” The young women on the stage on Wednesday night were a great advertisement for doing just that.Rihanna, who earned $36m in 2016, is one of the most influential style figures in pop culture currently, much admired for her risk-taking and spontaneity. Such is her influence that when she appeared on the front of British Vogue for August, she single-handedly made pencil-thin eyebrows – a faux pas for many years – a trend again. Her 2016 collaboration with Puma on a Fenty clothing collection generated $1bn for the sportswear brand. Savage x Fenty is the latest way she is monetising that influence.Marc Jacobs’ show was earlier in the evening. It was scheduled for 6pm but was delayed by nearly 90 minutes, causing Anna Wintour and several other high-profile editors to leave before it started. There are already consistent rumours that the Marc Jacobs brand is in jeopardy, with stores in Europe closing earlier this year. This latest talking point isn’t likely to stop the rumours.The collection was a summer take on the designer’s autumnwinter 80s odyssey. There were boxy suits, glitter tights and puffball cocktail dresses. Frills were extreme, with some dresses like the mille-feuille of the most luxurious of cakes, in sugared almond colours. These fabulous concoctions will no doubt be eaten up by stylists next season, though their wearability beyond the fashion shoot is untested.Jacobs is now a celebrity as well as a designer. In April, he proposed to his partner Charly Defrancesco with a flash mob in a branch of Mexican fast food restaurant Chipotle. The video went viral. His summer since then has involved a birthday party with Debbie Harry bringing in his cake, and holidays with Kate Moss. This show is just the latest instalment for his many fans to absorb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4592e1c03b1836188b898283c023f09cd2234e12/0_0_3000_2136/master/3000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f6f605631551d410ba256d7b0ea0c0a 720w","title":"commons launches investigation over corbyn aide without security clearance","story":"Labour leader secretary Iram Awan’s work in Westminster with just a temporary pass may have breached parliamentary rulesHouse of Commons authorities have launched an investigation after it emerged that an aide in Jeremy Corbyn’s office has been working in parliament without a pass.A House of Commons spokesman said: “An investigation into an alleged breach of parliamentary rules has been launched and so we will not be commenting further.”Another Corbyn aide, Unite’s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, who has been on part-time secondment to Labour for several months, also confirmed that he had not yet obtained a permanent pass.

But a paper on aviation that had been anticipated – amid warnings that planes could be grounded in an extreme scenario – is not due to appear.Ministers have previously indicated that each batch of no-deal papers will raise more serious issues than before.

He probably hasn’t told you that. Lots of people hate him.”.The home secretary, Sajid Javid, tweeted that the protest was “absolutely disgraceful”. Former Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis, an arch rival of the MP on Brexit, said: “Demonstrating outside Mr Rees-Mogg’s house and hustling his children is utterly deplorable. The police should sort this out immediately.”Yvette Cooper, Labour chair of the home affairs select committee further criticised the actions by the activists. Former Tory MP Ben Gummer, whose father John was a senior minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, added: “I am the child of a politician who had a big media profile. I had my share of this stuff. All I can say is that seeing it done to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children brings an oh so angry lump to my throat. It is a cruel thing to do to a child, and it will mark them forever.”Ian Lavery, chair of the Labour party, tweeted: Bone also targeted the family’s nanny, Veronica Crook, when she arrived on the doorstep with two more of the couple’s children, including baby son Sixtus.Bone shouted: “Daddy doesn’t pay her very much. Daddy says the minimum wage doesn’t count for anything. Poor Nanny Crook who looks after you and wipes your bottom, doesn’t get enough money every week. But Daddy doesn’t care.” “Your dad won’t answer the question,” he told the children, after the MP refused to reveal how much their nanny was paid. Crook answered: “I don’t need to tell you that… All I can tell you is I’m very happy.”The anarchist author accused the nanny of having “Stockholm syndrome” and of saying whatever her employer asked her to. She was asked whether she wanted to join a union to which she responded, “No, I don’t want to do that,” laughing.Sources close to the family played down the incident, suggesting the children had thought it was amusing.Rees-Mogg, who missed chairing a febrile meeting of the European Research Group to rush home to his family, told the Sun newspaper: “It was a small protest by anarchists, which not surprisingly was disorganised, unpunctual and shortlived.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f27b6d2f3a41e2c871a3a73955259a7d6bbbd5f8/121_44_1331_799/master/1331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93419e004f998e83ff1c326b008a20bf","title":"quizmaster corbyns tricky questions leave may bewildered","story":"Acting like the host of University Challenge gave Labour’s leader a triumphant PMQsFinally a breakthrough. After years of searching for a format that might cut through with the audience at home, Jeremy Corbyn struck gold. Rather than bothering with longwinded statements that invariably petered out and only occasionally ended with a question, the Labour leader opted for his own version of University Challenge.Your starter for 10. What do the National Farmers Union, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Housing Federation, single parents charity Gingerbread and the Royal Society of Arts have in common?A look of bewilderment passed across the prime minister’s face. She glanced sideways at her cabinet colleagues for any signs of help. They all avoided her gaze. Rules were rules. No conferring. Realising that silence was not an option, she eventually pressed the buzzer. St Hugh’s, May. “Um, er, um,” Theresa May mumbled. I’m going to have to hurry you. Um, they were all very worthy organisations with which the government had good interactions.“Wrong,” yelled Corbyn triumphantly, affecting his best Paxman sneer. The right answer was that they all thought the government’s rollout of universal credit was a total disaster. Next question.If the Labour leader had continued in a similar vein it would have been box-office gold. What name is that of an Aryan Christian Germanic people who maintained a North African kingdom in the fifth and sixth centuries and who, under their king Gaiseric, sacked Rome in 455 and might also be applied to Boris Johnson. Come on St Hugh’s, I’ve got to have an answer. Too late. The answer is Vandal. Four more questions like this and the prime minister could have experienced her worst humiliation since her party conference speech last year.Instead, Corbyn went back to his traditional mode of attack and continued to press May on universal credit. And, to be fair, it wasn’t a bad second best. Mostly because he was on impregnable ground as even the government’s own agencies think the government’s handling of UC has been utterly abysmal. Would the prime minister like to agree with the National Audit Office report that says the government has been throwing more families into poverty?As it happened, she wouldn’t. Instead she chose to take a leaf out of Corbyn’s own book by quoting a constituent named Roberta who was eternally grateful to universal credit. It wasn’t a wholly successful ersionary tactic. When the Labour leader cites iniduals they are understood to represent many thousands of people like them. May merely sounded as if she had lucked out and found the one person in the country who had a positive experience of UC.The exchanges ended with Corbyn reciting an irrefutable catalogue of government failures which the Tories could only respond to by sticking their fingers in their ears and shouting “La, La, La” as loudly as possible. It wasn’t a great look to see the Conservative benches trying to shout down the Labour leader while he stood up for the poor and the disabled, but May appeared rather reassured. It was the biggest show of support she has had from her party in months.It has also been the prime minister’s level of support that appeared to be uppermost in the mind of Jacob Rees-Mogg in recent days. After the complete Dadaist clusterfuck of their economic Brexit plan the previous day and an evening meeting when the Provo lunatics momentarily took over the asylum, the European Research Group has had a reality check. Boris, their leader in waiting, has been exposed as a hollow man whose commitment even to himself is wavering, and they just don’t have the clout to bring down the prime minister and impose their Brexit vision.No wonder, then, that their event to explain their solution to the Irish border had the feel of the morning after the night before. The Day of the Living Dead. Theresa Villiers, Owen Paterson, Maria Caulfield, David Trimble and David Davis sat behind a table with the expression of people who had only just realised they had volunteered to appear in their own hostage video.No one had much to say. “There’s nothing new here,” said Paterson, a man more used to being outwitted by badgers. “It’s all really boring.” For once he was telling the truth. The ERG had come up with not much more than ideas for an exciting development in international borders that existed nowhere else in the world and had already been rejected by both the EU and the UK.It was Davis who looked the most depressed. Normally he can manage a smile even in extremis. Now he was just crushed. There was a time when he had been a contender. Out of his depth, maybe, but still a contender. Now he was just out of the loop. He had given up a career to throw in his lot with a bunch of losers and psychos who didn’t have a prayer. The numbers just didn’t stack up. If only he had been better at maths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768aaa03261f71c3e678bfd3659663fdfed42e89/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ecab54be8e11b3f044fda9830799f7","title":"diane abbott to announce labour plans to overhaul visa policy","story":"Shadow home secretary to set out the opposition’s vision of a fairer post-Brexit immigration system The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, is set to announce Labour’s vision for a fairer post-Brexit immigration system including a simplified visa regime for foreign workers.In a speech at Portcullis House in Westminster on Thursday, Abbott will unveil proposals to overhaul the work visa policy in the UK, which is currently structured with a range of tiers reflecting different employment categories.Theproposed regime under a Labour government would offer rights of work, residency and accelerated citizenship to a range of professions, workers and those creating employment who want to come here based on the needs of the economy.“We have economic needs that dictate we need migrants, to help tackle skills and labour shortages,” Abbott will say.“I am announcing that Labour in government will establish a completely reformed work visa policy. This policy will sit alongside the existing visas for business trips, students, visitors and tourists.“We will avoid the idiocy of preventing doctors and nurses from coming here to take up job offers. Under our new work visa system, anyone with specified bona fide skills can come here to work.“The new, integrated work visa allows us to offer rights of work and residency and accelerated citizenship to a range of professions, workers and those creating employment who want to come here. It will be available to all those we need to come here, whether it is doctors, or scientists, or care workers.“This will apply across a range of jobs, skills and professions. People coming to take up specific job offers, where it can be shown that those jobs cannot be filled by workers already resident here, will be able to come here.”Abbott’s speech comes ahead of a key report from the migration advisory committee, to be published on Tuesday, on the impact of EU migration on the British labour market. It is expected to inform the government’s post-Brexit immigration policy, with ministers delaying the publication of an immigration white paper until its publication.The shadow home secretary will repeat her criticism of the government’s role in the Windrush scandal, in which British residents were wrongly targeted by the Tories’ ‘hostile environment’ policy and in some cases were detained and deported. She will also reiterate Labour plans to rip up the 2014 Immigration Act, in which many of the hostile-environment policies are enshrined in law.There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures of immigrants from the UK: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportations apply to people and their children whose removal is deemed \u0027conducive to the public good\u0027 by the home secretary. They can also be recommended by a court.\u0026nbspAdministrative removals refer to cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or violated the conditions of their leave to remain.Voluntary departures are people against whom enforced removal has been initiated the term \u0027voluntary\u0027 simply describes how they leave. There are three sub-categories:\u0026nbspa) Those who depart via assisted voluntary return schemes. b) Those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities.c) Those who leave without notifying the government.Abbott will also pledge to end “rip-off” Home Office fees in visa and immigration cases, as highlighted by the , including the controversial cost of registration fees for children. Registration is the process where someone who has an existing right to British citizenship applies to obtain it. It costs £1,012 to register under-18s, up from £500 in 2011. In 2014, discounts for a second or additional child were scrapped.“Exorbitant charges hit the poor and those with larger families the hardest,” Abbott will say. “It is discriminatory and unjustifiable. As people come here to work, they pay taxes. They already make a contribution … Labour will end this rip-off. Charges will be reviewed so that they closer reflect the actual cost.”The shadow home secretary will also pledge to remove illegal immigrants more efficiently but shift the focus to preventing illegal migrants arriving in the UK by boosting the number of Border Force officers.On the government’s target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, a target it has consistently failed to meet since 2010, Abbott will comment: “When they continually fail to meet their target, and without ever showing how they will meet it, then we are entitled to be a little jaundiced about its real purpose. But when they continue to suggest it is all the fault of EU migration, when non-EU migration – the bit they do control – alone is more than double the total target, we are entitled to call it out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44e70b853fe295bdc8675bc74a9be21c1f048e8/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=079f82e06405eb32e20c9f10dbe4f380","title":"the feline timeline a history of cats from ancient egypt to instagram","story":"Celebrated and persecuted in equal measure, cats have been with us since the dawn of civilisation, featuring in verse, literature and film. Kate Wills explains why cat history is our historyThere is a saying that “nobody owns a cat”, but archaeological remains suggest that wildcats have been slinking inside huts for treats and strokes for around 9,000 years. Scientists recently discovered that all of today’s domestic cats descend from one subspecies of African wildcat, and that our ancestors could be ided into cat or dog people as early as the stone age.Perhaps the ultimate “cat people” were the Egyptians, who worshipped our feline friends to such an extent that they imposed the death penalty for killing one, shaved their eyebrows in grief when theirs died, and had them mummified and placed in purr-amids in readiness for the kitty afterlife. For ancient Romans, Felis silvestris catus was a symbol of liberty and an effective form of pest control. It was cats’ mice-bothering skills that allowed them to pad across Asia, where dedicated mousers protected silkworm cocoons and treasured manuscripts from rodents.The middle ages were a bit of a low period in the history of catkind, as felines were cast as symbols of “sinful” female sexuality and witchcraft by the church. In Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise on witchcraft usually translated as The Witch Hammer, a 13th-century folk story depicts three witches that turn themselves into cats and attack a man. From then on witches were believed to have cats as sidekicks, or to change into feline form in the night. But by the 15th century, cats were coming back into favour, helped in part by the legend of Dick Whittington, who made his fortune thanks to his rat-killing kitty. This kitty may or may not have worn boots in real life – and may or may not have sounded like Antonio Banderas.It was around this time that cat-fans started breeding moggies for particular coat colours and textures. Kitty genetics is a fascinating field. Cats come in two dominant colours – black and red – that are “diluted” or “masked” to become “blue” (appearing grey) or “cream”. The red colour is only carried on the X chromosome, which is why tortoiseshell cats are nearly always female, and ginger cats are nearly always male. (This is all great trivia with which to impress your cat-loving andor geneticist friends, by the way.)There have been many “crazy cat ladies” – and gentlemen, for that matter – throughout history, notably Cardinal Richelieu (AKA the baddie in The Three Musketeers), who had 14 cats at the time of his death in 1642, including Ludovic le Cruel, so named because of his savage dedication to killing rats. Catherine the Great of Russia turned the Winter Palace into a cattery, with her favoured breed of Russian blues running wild upstairs and a basement full of “working cats” that she promoted to guard status, complete with salaries and extra food rations. Winston Churchill kept cats at Chartwell, while Abraham Lincoln was such a cat obsessive that he fed his kittens Tabby and Dixy at the table at a state dinner, and regularly took in strays to the White House.As cats became a popular indoor pet – no doubt helped by the invention of cat litter in 1947 – they clawed their way into popular culture, too. Whole essays have been written on the cartoon cat, from Sylvester the Cat, who first appeared in 1939, right up to Pokémon’s Meowth, via Felix, Top Cat, Garfield, Bagpuss and the Aristocats. Not to forget Alice’s Cheshire Cat, which also appeared in cartoon form in the 1951 Disney film.In a nod to the feline’s medieval association with evil, cats also became the purr-fect accomplice for witches, Bond villains and, in homage, Mike Myers’s Dr Evil. They were also the animal ally of choice for breakfasters at Tiffany’s, the alien-battling Ripley in the otherwise very non-furry Alien films, and leather-loving Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman herself in Batman Returns.But it’s the internet that has taken cats from much-loved pet to feline overlord. From “I can has cheezburger” memes to Grumpy Cat, via the 52 million people who have watched a ginger cat called Fatso play a keyboard, Brits share 3.8m cat pictures and videos every day. Meanwhile, social media has made stars of some pampered pusses, such as Karl Lagerfeld’s fluffy white Birman, Choupette (112.4k followers), Kitty Purry (Katy Perry’s cat) and Taylor Swift’s two cats, who now have their own merchandise line, the Meredith and Olivia Swift collection.But before memes there was poetry. In the ninth century, an Irish monk wrote a poem about his cat, Pangur Bán. For Baudelaire, the cat’s meow was the very source of his verse. When Romantic poet Robert Southey’s cat, Rumpelstiltskin, finally went for his great catnap in the sky, Southey wrote: “There should be a court mourning in Catland.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gray was composing an Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. If only they’d been alive in 2002, when the first cloned kitten – the aptly named “CC” – was born.And while Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story Cat Person could stake a claim, the most famous feline work of literature has to be TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. Fitting, then, that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-breaking 1981 musical version is about to get a big screen reboot, starring – who else? – contemporary cat woman Taylor Swift.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat. For advice speak to your vet or consult a nutritional advice line such as Royal Canin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5c5c36b9266f67004f0e638a881703330cc83dc/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1677141adcce87497e7e0aade3a46b8","title":"earliest known drawing found on rock in south african cave","story":"Researchers believe the pattern on the fragment of rock is 73,000 years old, but are perplexed as to what it might representIt lacks the grace of Da Vinci and has none of the warmth of Rubens, but the criss-crossed pattern on the chunk of rock is remarkable all the same. According to researchers who unearthed the piece, it is the earliest known drawing in the world.Archaeologists found the marked stone fragment as they sifted through spear points and other material excavated at Blombos cave in South Africa. It has taken seven years of tests to conclude that a human made the lines with an ochre crayon 73,000 years ago.The simple red marks adorn a flake the size of two thumbnails which appears to have broken off a grindstone cobble used to turn lumps of ochre into paint powder. The lines end so abruptly at the fragment’s edges that researchers believe the cross-hatches were originally part of a larger design drawn on the cobble.“This is first known drawing in human history,” said Francesco d’Errico, a researcher on the team at the University of Bordeaux. “What does it mean? I don’t know. What I do know is that what can look very abstract to us could mean something to the people in the traditional society who produced it.”Until now, the oldest known drawings have been the more impressive and extensive works that cover cave walls in El Castillo in Spain and Maros in Sulawesi, Indonesia. But those abstract and figurative images were made more recently, 40,000 years ago at most.Located on the southern tip of South Africa, about 300km east of Cape Town, Blombos cave has proved a treasure trove of ancient human artefacts from 70,000 to 100,000 years old. Excavations have uncovered painted shell beads, double-sided spear points, and pieces of ochre engraved with the same cross-hatched design as found on the chunk of grindstone. The pattern also features at the nearby younger sites of Diepkloof and Klipdrift, where archaeologists found it engraved on ostrich egg shells.The patterned stone from Blombos was found by chance in 2011 as researchers washed ash and dirt from spear points and other artefacts uncovered at the site. The discovery prompted an intensive effort to analyse the marks – six thin lines crossed by three others – and discern how they got there.“It’s very striking,” said Christopher Henshilwood, leader of the research team and director of the Centre for Early Sapiens Behaviour at the University of Bergen in Norway. “You can see immediately that it’s a cross-hatch design in red on a smooth surface. It’s very tiny but it’s pretty impressive.”Through a combination of microscopic examination of the stone and experiments that set out to recreate the pattern, the researchers conclude that the drawing was made with an ochre crayon. While most of the lines were made in single strokes, others were created by rubbing the ochre back and forth. To achieve such narrow lines, the ochre must have been hard and pointed, its tip between one and three millimetres wide, according to a report in the journal, Nature.Ochre is a broad term for rocks and clays that are coloured red or orange by the iron-rich minerals they contain. Tests on the red lines that make up the Blombos drawing show that the pigment contains haematite, a common reddish-black iron ore.“The lines are very deliberate,” said Henshilwood. “When we reproduced the lines, you have to have a very firm hand and have to apply the ochre quite determinedly to make them look like that.”He believes that Homo sapiens used the grindstone, a silcrete cobble, to turn hard ochre rocks into a powder suitable for paint. The grindstone was then washed and the cross-hatched design added to the smooth, dipped surface produced by the grinding process. At some point later, the cobble was broken and the marked fragment left behind.“There’s no doubt that it’s a symbol that meant something to the people who made it,” Henshilwood said. “It’s a symbol that’s been repeated over and over again, and it keeps on being repeated across the world in Australia, France and Spain, and everywhere else. This is part of the repertoire of signs the human brain reproduces. I can’t tell you what it means, and I can’t say it’s art.”Warm in the winter and cool in the summer, Blombos cave would have been a welcome shelter for early humans moving along what is now the southern Cape coast. Today, the cave is a stone’s throw from the sea, but when the drawing was made the cave would have sat 100km inland.“You feel a very strong connection when you work in the cave. It’s a time machine,” said Henshilwood. “You can see something and know it was put there by a human 75,000 or 90,000 years ago, and it hasn’t moved at all. And next to it is the bone they chewed and the fire they made and slept around at night. It’s almost weird. You can’t believe that it has survived for that long.”Wil Roebroeks, professor of paleolithic archaeology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, described the work as “very thorough”.“This detailed study of red lines on a small piece of silcrete underlines that these patterns were intentional, and made on various media with different techniques,” he said. “However, we can only guess at what these patterns represented, if anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c3bf0297d2bcb5bbec5b352fc18f757674a1f4/0_658_4835_2901/master/4835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=061d169c2994d7ddc7cce75e2238fcc5","title":"alcohol dependency at record high but fewer being treated data shows","story":"One in seven of 605,688 people needing help in England received treatment in 2016-17 Fewer problem drinkers are receiving treatment even though record numbers need help, figures from the House of Commons library show.Just 80,454 people in England were treated in 2016-17 for addiction to alcohol,about one in seven of the 605,688 people being deemed to be “alcohol dependent”.Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth, who obtained the figures, blamed the dwindling number of people in treatment on government cuts to public health budgets.“Tory austerity has meant cutting treatment services for some of the most vulnerable in our society. It is devastating, misguided and completely counterproductive,” said the shadow health minister.“People addicted to alcohol are paying the price for this government’s cruel and reckless cuts to public health.”Ashworth, who has spoken candidly about his experience of being the son of an alcoholic father, will on Thursday commit a future Labour government to making expansion of services for those addicted to alcohol, drugs or both a key priority.He will tell the national substance misuse conference in Birmingham that action is needed because alcohol leads to more than 1m admissions to hospital a year, while 200,000 children are growing up with an alcoholic parent.Addiction services are also close to “breaking point” as the result of the £550m of cuts to public health budgets of local councils ordered by ministers since 2015 to give more money to overworked hospitals, Ashworth will say.Analysis by Labour claims that town halls in England, which fund addiction work through their public health budgets, plan to reduce spending on help for people with alcohol and drug problems by a further £34m in 2018-19.The British Medical Association is calling for tough measures to reduce public health problems, including obesity and problem drinking, in order to reduce the number of Britons dying prematurely.The BMA also wants a hike in the taxes on tobacco products, a comprehensive plan to tackle illness linked to people’s diets and crackdown on the marketing of foodstuffs high in fat, salt and sugar.Such steps could cut the number of people developing or dying early from cancer, heart, lung and liver disease, as well as strokes, said Prof Dame Parveen Kumar, who chairs of the BMA’s board of science.“Tragically, the failure to prioritise public health prevention continues to cost people their lives,” Kumar said, adding that much greater investment is need in services that tackle smoking, heavy drinking, physical inactivity and poor diet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b76db79fa31db70383a057f1f1ab2be3b301a9b/0_21_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6c9939dc743b2d94256a937ad1e962","title":"anthony joshua statement win povetkin","story":"• Joshua fights the Russian heavyweight on 22 September• ‘I am the No 1 in the ision, I ain’t got to show anything’Anthony Joshua insists he will emerge triumphant in heavyweight boxing’s power struggle by stopping Alexander Povetkin next week – and then returning to Wembley next April to beat Deontay Wilder in a massive reunification fight.But with boxing’s rumour mill suggesting that WBC champion Wilder and Tyson Fury will shortly announce a 1 December date in Las Vegas for their superfight, Joshua insists he has no need to make a statement by beating Povetkin in spectacular style.“I am the No 1 in the ision, I ain’t got to show anything,” said Joshua, when it was put to him that his last two fights against Carlos Takam and Joseph Parker might fallen short of his high standards. “Name me a fighter that has a better record than me after 22 fights? Ever since the amateurs, nonstop I have been on top of my game.“I proved myself time and again at the top level. If people aren’t satisfied with it now, they never will be. Look at Floyd Mayweather. They are never happy with him and he is one of the greatest of all time. History is all that matters. I will prove myself.”Joshua, who will put his WBA, IBF and WBO belts on the line against Povetkin at Wembley on September 22, also raised an eyebrow at Fury’s claims that he – rather than Joshua – was the ision’s lineal champion.“You’ve got to have a bit of respect,” said Joshua. ”That championship belt ain’t just about fighting. You can’t expect the whole ision to go on hold. He had his issues and paused for three years. The whole ision can’t wait and sit down, the ball keeps rolling.“Good luck to Fury, Wilder and myself. But when all’s said and done, I won’t be that geezer in the pub telling war stories about ‘I was the lineal champ’. I am focused on my own career and where I am going.”Joshua insisted he was confident that a fight with Wilder would be made for 13 April at Wembley despite negotiations breaking down several times.“It’s not as complicated as people think but at the moment it is like a power struggle in the heavyweight ision,” he said. “But the venue is set and we understand their terms. Eddie Hearn has signed a contract with my blessing and sent it off to Wilder’s team.

But Bayliss, the England head coach, feels the 26-year-old’s continuation still hangs in the balance, saying: “I’m sure he will be a bit nervous about which way it will go. He scored runs in India on spinning wickets and I’m sure that will be in his favour.“But he is a big boy, he knows runs on the board count as well. All of those points will have to be discussed and I can’t say at this stage or another whether he will go or not.”Smith and the panel will convene at the end of the penultimate round of County Championship matches next week, with Bayliss joining via telephone after returning home to Australia. As well as the debate over Jennings, he acknowledged the claims of Rory Burns, James Vince, Joe Denly and Ollie Pope will also be discussed.In terms of bowling, Bayliss admitted the idea of resting a senior seamer – most likely Stuart Broad – is “on the agenda”, with the Australian leaning towards offering an opportunity to a younger man in light of the 20-year-old Sam Curran’s breakthrough summer.Smith is keen to tailor squads to conditions and though spin will probably dominate in Sri Lanka, such that Jack Leach will likely play alongside Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, Ollie Stone of Warwickshire and Somerset’s Jamie Overton are two genuine fast bowlers who could transcend what are expected to be unhelpful pitches.Both the 24-year-olds have a track record of injury but have been among the wickets this summer.

Pichot has now revealed, however, that fresh discussions on how to make the Test game more viable will be held in Sydney later this month and accepts there are “a lot of problems that we need to address”.There are few more passionate administrators anywhere than Pichot and the former Argentina captain and scrum-half is genuinely concerned that time is running out to save the traditional Test game from the financial abyss. Together with Bill Beaumont, World Rugby’s chairman, he is committed to future-proofing his beloved sport, with the amalgamation of the existing June and November windows into one block among the proposals to make Test fixtures more meaningful.“If you ask me as a businessman, the business side of it is not working,” Pichot said. “If you ask me as the playing side, it’s not working. Is the international game under threat? I think it is. Look at the balance sheets of some nations and you can see exactly where we stand.“My view is that players cannot carry on playing as they are now. You cannot have them playing 30-odd competitive club and international games just because you want bums on seats.“I have been a professional player so I understand how it goes but you have to take care of the athlete. The first principle is the players’ welfare because they inspire everyone, both us now and the next generation. That is important for the growth of the game.”The mere fact, though, that the San Francisco agreement is to be revisited underlines the seriousness of the financial situation facing certain unions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.With Pichot’s term of office due to expire after the next World Cup, a pivotal moment in global rugby’s history is fast approaching. “I’m a business guy and I want to have a safe business model and for the international game to be respected,” Pichot said. “The growth of the game is very big for me I like to see emerging countries develop.“If rugby wants to be big and a sound business, we cannot behave like an old-school organisation. We have a group in Sydney to reopen the door, then I think all parties should meet again. We should work with them to see what’s better. How many games does a club need to break even? How many games does a nation need? But ask the big club owners and they all want the international game. It is not a question of them not wanting the international game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c57476b35000fdeb64a2aa7721aaae8cd2f194/0_33_3968_2380/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1888515c14a47937edffc85ef550b8c0","title":"charles leclerc ferrari sauber rookie","story":"The 20-year-old Sauber rookie is calm, assured and mature beyond his years, handling tragedy with remarkable composure and F1 with excellent pace and outstanding racecraftThrowing young talent into the heat of the battle at the very front of the Formula One grid is a bold move. For Ferrari, who have chosen to do just that by promoting the 20-year-old rookie Charles Leclerc to the team for next season, it is also out of character, given their usually more conservative approach to appointing drivers. Yet the Scuderia are far from taking a chance with Leclerc, one of the most exciting talents in the sport, who has proved he has the attributes to partner Sebastian Vettel in the most prestigious drive in motor racing.Last season, on his way to a dominant title win in F2, Leclerc told me at the Hungaroring it was still a dream to make it to F1. He did not have to wait long and now drives for Sauber. Before this year’s Monaco Grand Prix, his home race, he said it was “a dream” to one day drive the red cars. In 2019 his remarkable and almost unprecedented fulfilment of all these aspirations will be complete as he joins Ferrari, to replace Kimi Räikkönen.This was sooner than expected, despite his talent. He is the youngest driver to have been appointed by Ferrari since Ricardo Rodríguez entered the Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia in 1961. More noticeably, he is the least experienced driver they have appointed since Enzo Ferrari opted to give Gilles Villeneuve a shot in one of his cars at the Canadian Grand Prix in 1977. Villeneuve had only one race to his name Leclerc will take his seat with just one season under his belt.Yet there is no sense that this unusual shift in policy is anything but calculated on Leclerc’s obvious talent. It would have been easy to maintain Räikkönen for one more season and for Leclerc to remain at Sauber. Ferrari have made a bold move but it is one the Monégasque driver deserves.He is calm, assured and mature beyond his years. Leclerc dealt with both the death of his godfather, Jules Bianchi, in 2015 and his father last year with remarkable composure. Before this season began he was honest about the scale of task that lay ahead and has since proved able to adapt and learn with alacrity.Ferrari brought him into their young driver academy in 2016 and were clearly aware then of his potential. At the Hungaroring last year, although he was driving in F2 for Prema, a representative of the Scuderia had to be present when he was interviewed, so protective were they of their protege. Their nurturing has worked well, if coming to fruition possibly sooner than expected.Crucially Leclerc had put in the performances this season to impress the late Sergio Marchionne, the former Ferrari chairman who wanted him in the car in 2019 the team have honoured his intentions.When the season opened this was far from a foregone conclusion. Sauber brought an aggressive new design this season. A rookie year is tough enough in a tried and tested ride but their car was a handful to drive as they began to understand the package and attempt to unlock its potential. A spin at the third round in China was chastening for Leclerc.He reacted with complete professionalism and went back to the team to work through ways he and the car could develop together. What followed caught Marchionne and everyone else’s attention. At the next round in Baku he was sixth. Four more points finishes from the following five races ensued. Over fastest lap pace the Sauber is the second slowest car on the grid, yet Leclerc has put it into Q3 three times and out-qualified his vastly more experienced team-mate, Marcus Ericsson, 11 times to three.Mere numbers do not tell the full story quite as clearly as his racecraft does. In Baku he took places at the start, then made Pierre Gasly and Lance Stroll look sluggish as he passed them at a restart, before defending his place against Fernando Alonso. It was the race of a driver who had found his feet in a new formula remarkably swiftly and another outstanding meeting in Spain followed.Since which the talk of him moving to Ferrari gathered more and more momentum, an additional weight he has handled with aplomb. Open and straightforward in person, he is given to considering answers to ensure what he says is of import, reflecting a character that is constantly looking for ways to improve. This ability to exercise self-analysis will stand him in good stead when steps into the spotlight next season.When he does so, Leclerc will immediately be in the mix with Vettel and Lewis Hamilton in a car proven to be well-balanced and quick. Ferrari believe he is ready to do so and F1 will be all the better for their faith in him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08df895cdbf18f7fd5b464da7fd2e4f2b2fcd3a7/0_62_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62a9612f25671702d395242047ca8ab1","title":"apple unveils iphone xs apple watch","story":"Tech giant unveils new gadgets at California bash, including biggest iPhone yet and Apple Watch with range of health featuresApple has launched a trio of iPhones and upgraded smartwatches that can detect heart problems at its annual product launch event in Cupertino on Wednesday.The tech company unveiled a new iteration of the flagship iPhone X with a 5.8in screen dubbed the iPhone XS – pronounced “ten S” rather than “excess” as well as the iPhone XS Max, which comes with a larger 6.5in screen.Both feature an upgraded version of the iPhone X’s dual lens camera – one of the device’s best features – which allows for better portraits and higher-quality videos even in low light. They also come with Face ID facial recognition for unlocking the device and a richer display.The company is also launching a lower-cost 6.1inch version, the iPhone XR. The iPhone XR comes in a range of candy colours, is made from aluminium rather than stainless steel, has a single camera system and trades the OLED screen of its more expensive counterparts for an edge-to-edge LCD screen.The last time Apple launched a lower-cost version of the iPhone was the iPhone 5c in 2013, when it took the innards of the previous generation’s iPhone 5 and wrapped it in a plastic body.All three devices also come with a more powerful ‘A12 Bionic’ processor which allows developers to build more sophisticated video games, augmented reality experiences and other apps with real-time features that couldn’t previously run on a mobile device. Apple demonstrated one app, HomeCourt, that uses the camera viewfinder to track and analyse basketball shots to provide real-time feedback that can help players improve their technique.“No other chip in the world would allow us to do this,” said Apple’s Kaiann Drance, on stage at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park, the company’s new “spaceship” campus.“With the new iPhone X line-up and its pricing repositioning, Apple demonstrates once again it excels at extending the lifecycle of its product portfolio through incremental innovation, impressive technical specifications boosting the performance of its devices and smart marketing,” said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson.The iPhone XR starts at $749 for 64GB of storage the iPhone XS at $999 and the iPhone XS Max at $1099. All can be pre-ordered from 19 October and will start shipping the following week.Apple also unveiled the the Apple Watch Series 4, with improved cellular connectivity, larger screen, more powerful processor and a range of additional health-tracking features.The smartwatches now feature an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor which can measure not only the heart’s rate but its rhythm. Such a sensor can detect heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, a common cause of strokes. The watches, which have been endorsed by the American Heart Association and have clearance from the FDA, still have the original optical sensors, which flash pulsed light through the skin to detect heart rate.The device has also been fitted with an improved accelerometer and gyroscope that can detect if someone has fallen over, a feature that could be useful for older people. If a fall is detected and the person remains immobile for more than a minute, the device automatically calls their emergency contact.“Fall detection is a feature we hope you never need, but it’s really nice to know it’s there,” said Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams.At 40mm and 44m, the two variants are slightly larger, but thinner, than the previous iterations that measured 38mm and 42mm. The watches can be pre-ordered from 14 September with cellular connectivity, starting at $499, or just GPS, starting at $399.The older Series 3 watches will remain on sale from $279."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ed1672c5c04a8621b9dc1ce02dcfbb3dd700e1/0_151_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c2d2f1b2d099be3513011322ea4f02d","title":"boy skewered head survival missouri","story":"10-year-old expected to make full recovery after falling from tree and landing on meat skewer that penetrated his skullA 10-year-old Missouri boy is recovering after he was attacked by insects and tumbled from a tree, landing on a meat skewer that penetrated his skull from his face to the back of his head.But miraculously, that’s where Xavier Cunningham’s bad luck ended. The skewer had completely missed his eye, brain, spinal cord and major blood vessels, the Kansas City Star reports.Cunningham’s harrowing experience began Saturday afternoon when yellow jackets attacked him in a tree house at his home in Harrisonville, about 35 miles (56km) south of Kansas City. He fell to the ground and his mother, Gabrielle Miller, ran down the stairs when she heard screaming. His skull was pierced from front-to-back with half a foot of skewer still sticking out of his face.Miller tried to reassure her son, who told her “I’m dying, Mom” as they rushed to the hospital. He eventually was transferred to the University of Kansas Hospital, where endovascular neurosurgery director Koji Ebersole evaluated the wound.“You couldn’t draw it up any better,” Ebersole said. “It was one in a million for it to pass five or six inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things.”There was no active bleeding, allowing the hospital time to get personnel in place Sunday morning for a removal surgery, which was complicated by the fact that the skewer wasn’t round. Because it was square, with sharp edges, it would have to come out perfectly straight. Twisting it could cause additional severe injury.“Miraculous” would be an appropriate word to describe what happened, Ebersole said.Doctors think Cunningham could recover completely.“I have not seen anything passed to that depth in a situation that was survivable, let alone one where we think the recovery will be near complete if not complete,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec62f5dc60cd4b534e2fb70fe07732aa42f8572/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a43dc07da2fdc7bfd6554f91f17a0e7c","title":"north carolina didnt like science on sea levels so passed a law against it","story":"In 2012, the state whose low-lying coast lies in the path of Hurricane Florence reacted to a prediction of catastrophically rising seas by banning policies based on such forecastsWhen North Carolina got bad news about what its coast could look like thanks to climate change, it chose to ignore it.In 2012, the state now in the path of Hurricane Florence reacted to a prediction by its Coastal Resources Commission that sea levels could rise by 39in over the next century by passing a law that banned policies based on such forecasts.The legislation drew ridicule, including a mocking segment by comedian Stephen Colbert, who said: “If your science gives you a result you don’t like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved.”North Carolina has a long, low-lying coastline and is considered one of the US areas most vulnerable to rising sea levels.But dire predictions alarmed coastal developers and their allies, who said they did not believe the rise in sea level would be as bad as the worst models predicted and said such forecasts could unnecessarily hurt property values and drive up insurance costs.As a result, the state’s official policy, rather than adapting to the worst potential effects of climate change, has been to assume it simply won’t be that bad. Instead of forecasts, it has mandated predictions based on historical data on sea level rise.“The science panel used one model, the most extreme in the world,” Pat McElraft, the sponsor of the 2012 bill, said at the time, according to Reuters. “They need to use some science that we can all trust when we start making laws in North Carolina that affect property values on the coast.”The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and allowed to become law by the then governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat who neither signed nor vetoed the bill.The law required the coastal resources commission to put out another study in 2015, looking at expected sea level rise.That report looked only 30 years ahead, rather than a century. It found that the rise in sea level during that time was likely to be roughly 6in to 8in, with higher increases possible in parts of the Outer Banks.Some outside studies have offered more dire warnings. A report last year by the Union of Concerned Scientists said 13 North Carolina communities were likely to be “chronically inundated” with seawater by 2035.The state’s stance has shifted under the current governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who took office last year.Cooper announced last September that North Carolina would join the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals of the Paris climate accord, even though Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.“We remain committed to reducing pollution and protecting our environment,” Cooper said. “So much of North Carolina’s economy relies on protecting our treasured natural resources.”But Orrin Pilkey, a retired Duke University coastal geologist, wrote in a recent op-ed in the News \u0026amp Observer that the state has still failed to take the steps that communities in Virginia and New Jersey have taken, to prepare for rising sea levels.“Instead coastal development flourishes as more beachfront buildings, highways and bridges are built to ease access to our beautiful beaches,” he wrote. “Currently the unspoken plan is to wait until the situation is catastrophic and then respond.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1781fee84dad977ae5f8a6e418992eac064f22d/0_39_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0e194a27baff7ab3ef74d413d92e0d","title":"florence hurricane north carolina residents preparations latest","story":"With Florence looming in the Atlantic, the city’s residents are defiant, stubborn, and asking for ine intervention to get through yet another Carolina hurricaneAfter an hour-long wait outside on a balmy end-of-summer morning, Christian Endreson, 68, picked up the three pieces of plywood he needed to board up his daughter’s home and got in line to pay.He was not alone. Nearly a hundred people joined him in line for last minute supplies of plywood at The Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina, early Wednesday as Hurricane Florence barreled towards the Carolina coast.By late Wednesday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center predicted that a slow weakening in the storm will begin late Thursday but Florence was still forecast to be “an extremely dangerous major hurricane when it nears the US”.The system was expected to make landfall early Saturday – a predicted timing that keeps moving back incrementally as the storm chugs slowly across ocean waters.Having survived Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey in 2012, Endreson is refusing to leave his family’s home now.His five daughters are spread out over the country, nearly all of them having survived the likes of Hurricane Harvey in Galveston, Hurricane Irma in Fort Lauderdale last year and Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey, Endreson summarizes.As Endreson lined up to pay, a Home Depot associate came over the speaker and asked customers to remain calm, not be rude to employees, and not to panic before the store closes late morning. There is plenty of plywood in today, she added, before signing off.Walmart employee Joseph Smith, 52, said the store went through 60 pallets of water in 30 minutes as residents rushed in for supplies.“Canned meat, water, and batteries are what people are looking for right now,” Smith said, noting he has had to restock those the most since the start of the week. There’s plenty of bread still, he adds. He’s working the last shift before the store closes in the afternoon. “I don’t pay any attention to the hurricanes,” he added as he unloaded fish sticks into the freezer bin, “I’ve always had to work”.Meanwhile, down at the nearby coast, Matthew Parr, 34, finished his last surf on Wrightsville Beach.He’s lived in Wilmington his whole life and is going to hunker down inland at his house.“North Carolina gets hit a lot,” he said as he loaded his surfboard onto the back of his red pickup truck.Parr estimated he has lived through five hurricanes in this small beach town. Pointing to a friend in the passenger seat of his vehicle, Parr said he is a property insurance agent who believes he has probably gotten a couple of hundred calls in the last two days as homeowners in the region imagine the potential damage Florence can wreak on their homes and businesses.Across the street, the Redix clothing store is boarded up with the names of past hurricanes: Bertha, Fran, Matthew and Irene daubed on the wood. “Go home, Flo” a black spray painted sign says on a vacation rental office’s boarded up door down the street.A mailman drove by, delivering mail to now shuttered homes.Wrightsville Beach, unlike the town of Wilmington, is under the mandatory evacuation order.Police are allowing residents on and off the beach until Wednesday evening to secure their homes and remove belongings before the mandatory comes into effect curfew tonight.Stevie Cline, 25, stood on a patio overlooking the half-empty marina, while waiting for her brother-in-law, who plans to stay put, hoping to re-open his business soon after the storm. Cline beckoned an approaching boat to fill up on gas, sympathizing with its owner’s quest for fuel.“I had to go to five different gas stations the other day,” she recalled, but was quick to point out neighbors have been supportive. The owner of the boat dock she’s standing over let her fill up on boat gas, as she calls it, but he did charge her double, she said.With Florence looming, the city’s residents are defiant, stubborn, and asking for ine intervention to get through yet another Carolina hurricane.Because of her 10-year-old son and a six-week-old pitbull she’s fostering, Jackie Sage, 40, didn’t want to be stuck in the car so she hopes her house will hold up. Florence is the first major hurricane she and her family will weather, having moved to a house on the beach two years ago from Cincinnati.“Power to the prayer,” she says flashing a smile and a thumbs up after loading up her generator and putting gasoline in the car before driving back to her beach home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63eaa5f7dc89178971e7072611c2556d357f5721/0_250_3746_2247/master/3746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29ff16e4a03cff4bf44391cd4cd37e4b","title":"spanish actor detained after ridiculing god and the virgin mary","story":"Willy Toledo to face Madrid court after not showing up for questioning over Facebook post A Spanish actor accused of ridiculing God and the Virgin Mary has been detained for questioning by a judge, police have said, in the latest high-profile case to raise freedom of speech fears in the country.Willy Toledo, a cinema and television actor who is facing a complaint over a social media post last year criticising the blasphemy prosecution of three women, has twice failed to show up for questioning.He will be questioned by a judge on Thursday, a police spokeswoman told AFP, adding that the police acted on the orders of a Madrid court.Oscar-winner Javier Bardem has spoken out in support of Toledo, 48, warning that the country risked a return to the repressive era of dictator Francisco Franco.The case stems from a July 2017 Facebook message, in which Toledo defended three women who paraded in the southern city of Sevilla with a giant vagina, simulating a religious procession, dubbing it the “Coño Insumiso” or “Insubordinate Pussy”.In his post Toledo said: “I shit on God, and I have enough shit left over to shit on the dogma of the sanctity and virginity of the Virgin Mary. This country is unbearably shameful. I’m disgusted.”He was denounced by the Spanish Association of Christian Lawyers for “covering God and the Virgin Mary with ridicule”.Toledo did not answer a first summons for questioning on 18 April, arguing he had not “committed any offence and so there is no need to appear before a judge”.The Madrid court ordered he be detained after he again ignored a summons to appear for questioning on 28 June.The case is one many where artists have been probed or jailed for voicing their opinions in Spain.Several Twitter users and rappers have also been judged for glorifying terrorism or insulting the king in comments or lyrics, prompting criticism of the “repression” of freedom of expression  to Amnesty International.Earlier this year rapper Valtònyc fled to Belgium to avoid a three-and-a-half-year jail sentence for glorifying terror, insulting the king and issuing threats in his lyrics.

The UN has warned of the “worst humanitarian catastrophe” of this century if the attack goes ahead, since there are no remaining opposition areas to which those fleeing Idlib could be evacuated.The province is central to the outcome of the war and also the fate of the broader region. As the seven-year conflict draws to a close, each participant in the war, Syrian and non-Syrian, is trying to secure their interests, many of which run through Idlib. But few of those interests align. Most are mutually exclusive.External powers trying to carve out influence in northern Syria are Russia and Iran, to whom Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, owes his successes so far, and Turkey, in whom rebel groups continue to pin their hopes. There is also what remains of a fractured anti-Assad opposition, jihadist groups and a regime desperate to claim it has won the war.Above all, there at least 3 million people cornered in north-west Syria with nowhere to go. Many live in frugal shelters in crammed towns and villages, and some have fled to the fields in fear of the same sort of intensive Russian-led bombardment seen elsewhere in Syria.NGOs predict up to 700,000 people could leave their homes or shelters if a big attack is launched. The vast majority are likely to be unwilling to cross back into regime-controlled territory, fearing the retribution of a government from which they have fled.Of Idlib’s 3 million citizens, at least 1.5 million are believed to be exiles from elsewhere in Syria, particularly areas taken in conflict by Russian, Iranian and Syrian government forces, such as Ghouta and Darraya near Damascus, Homs, east Aleppo and Deraa. After each battlefield victory, communities who have not come to terms with Syrian officials have been given safe passage to the province.As the numbers of people have mounted, fears have risen that Idlib is being set up as a killbox – a place where jihadists are mixed in with civilians to reaffirm a Syrian government narrative that the 2011 anti-Assad uprising was all about jihad in the first place. Assad’s officials have branded all those who stood against him as terrorists, and years of dehumanising language has clouded the reality of who is living in Idlib and to whom they are aligned.The vast majority of the province’s population are Syrian citizens, mostly Arabs but with significant numbers of Kurds. Civilians greatly outweigh fighters, by at least 100 to one, according to UN estimates.Among those who have taken up arms in the province are the latest incarnation of original anti-Assad groups, reinforced by militants who have arrived from elsewhere in Syria. These groups are backed by Turkey and are in a contest for influence with the conservative Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham, which remains the strongest organisation in the area.Roughly half of the 10,000 fighters in the Islamists’ ranks are foreigners, with the Hurras al-Din group, formerly aligned with al-Qaida, among that number. The dissolution of both Islamist groups is a key demand of Russia, which will call the shots in any offensive. Turkey has said it needs more time to force the militants to leave. Where they would go remains unclear and Ankara’s demands for a truce, made during a recent trilateral summit in Tehran, were rebuffed by Moscow.Tahrir al-Sham remains the strongest group on the anti-Assad side, and the Turkish-backed Northern Front is also prominent. Both groups are well armed but are no match for the Russian air force or ageing, though effective, Syrian cannons and artillery pieces.Idlib is likely to be the last stand for those who first fought against Assad and others who have since joined the battle. The original uprising, beginning in the 2011 Arab spring, was fed partly by a class struggle that gave rise to a protest movement, joined by nationalists, conservatives, Islamists, jihadists – who used Syria as a platform for broader ambitions – and opportunists in search of power at any cost.On the pro-Assad side are what remains of the Syrian army, among them nationalists committed to saving the country and others loyal to the Assad regime. There are also militias raised as a home guard who played increasingly prominent roles when state structures were tested as the conflict went on.Key are Russian forces, led by the air force, which saved Assad from defeat in September 2015 and have asserted control over the war ever since. While the Russians have controlled the skies, Iranian-backed militias have dominated the ground war. They were the first into east Aleppo and have been active on most battlefields. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the most important Iranian proxy, has lost more than 1,700 fighters in Syria. Afghani, Iraqi and Yemeni fighters, as well as Iranians, have also died in large numbers.Whether Iranian-backed forces join the fight for Idlib will be key to whether the offensive is launched and how long it lasts. The Syrian opposition political bloc believes Iran is reluctant to commit the numbers it deployed earlier in the war. The Syrian army, meanwhile, is struggling to muster a large-scale fighting force that could support its heavy weapons and helicopters.The UN believes up to 700,000 newly displaced people would head towards the Turkish border or areas east of Idlib within 48 hours. While supplies of food and water into Idlib remain stable for now, an exodus of that scale would severely test an aid response. Turkey has said it will not let large numbers of new refugees across its now fortified border. That leaves a swathe of northern Syria it controls, known as the Euphrates Shield zone. This area is likely to be a destination for rebels looking for the last possible haven on Syrian soil.Ankara plans to use the Euphrates Shield area as leverage in Syria in the post-Idlib phase, but it would come under intense pressure to allow it to be used as a final refuge if and when an attack is launched. Meanwhile, it has said it will not allow Idlib province to be turned into a “lake of blood”.Owning a humanitarian catastrophe of a scale that dwarfs anything else in Syria would be a big price for Russia to pay. Syria, too, would be likely to be viewed as culpable in an offensive that leads to a larger-scale loss of life than in previous attacks. While international opinion has mostly mattered little to protagonists on both sides of the war, the scale of the potential bloodshed is galvanising outrage.It may not be enough to stop the war but it is likely to mean that fears of an imminent full-scale blitz could be misplaced. Instead, a slowly increasing rate of attacks that leads people to steadily leave rather than flee in panic could well be a plan of action."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"CPL sent tests to labs in Florida, Nevada and Hawaii, but CervicalCheck did not knowScience Lives: Dr Annie Curtis of the RCSI\u0026rsquos strategic academic recruitment programmeNew study also shows victims have increased levels of trust in police service since 1992Land Development Agency will designate 30 zones in Dublin and 10 in Cork for buildingConfusion over rules of engagement in first election to feature incumbent since 1965Brother owners were not told land bought for over \u0026euro1m was listed for auctionGovernment \u0027needs to stop making aspirational pledges\u0026rsquo and adopt renewable energy, says Prof John SweeneyMr Justice Gerard Hogan ratified as advocate general whose advice assists judges\u0026rsquo deliberationsOfficials are reportedly redrafting the provision to ease British fears over unionPhishing message latest in long line of scams from criminals targeting vulnerable peopleInvestigation highlights flawed tender processes at Kildare Wicklow ETBStudent says he was injured as he was being arrested outside Dublin propertyDr Gabriel Scally recommends statutory duty of candour on iniduals and organisationsGaelchol\u0026aacuteiste Luimnigh principal Donnacha \u0026Oacute Treasaigh \u0026lsquothrilled\u0026rsquo with his studentsGarda criticised after after activists removed from property on foot of court orderGarda\u0026iacute took family to Portiuncula Hospital after they presented as homeless last weekCouncil urged to strengthen guide to put practice of open disclosure beyond doubtIrish Traveller Movement calls for dedicated housing agency to bypass local authorities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3627251.1536778430!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential election higgins likely to take part in tv debates","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins: may formally announce his candidacy at the National Ploughing Championship on September 19th. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPresident Michael D Higgins is almost certain to take part in televised debates during the presidential election campaign, according to sources close to him.With this being the first presidential election since 1965 involving an incumbent, confusion has surrounded the nature of the campaign and the rules of engagement ahead of nominations closing on September 26th.The  understands that RTÉ has made no formal approach yet and will not engage until the President has put his campaign team in place.Not all members of that team have yet been selected, although it is expected that some of his special advisers will resign for the duration of the election campaign in order to support his bid for re-election.The President is expected to formally announce his candidacy ahead of the deadline, possibly during his visit to the National Ploughing Championship on September 19th.When outgoing president Éamon de Valera contested the 1965 election, he did not campaign, citing the grounds that, as president, he was above politics.According to reliable sources in RTÉ, as well as those who have worked with President Higgins in the past, the campaign will be a full one with televised debates but perhaps will be more muted than in 2011, when candidates were involved in multiple debates.“Until the President engages his election team, it is quite hard for us to get a steer on the shape of the campaign,” said an RTÉ source. “We are planning but it depends on what can be agreed when the campaign proper starts.”The RTÉ source said the national broadcaster expected at least one televised debate involving all candidates. Seán Gallagher, who has secured a nomination from county councils, has also indicated he is willing to participate in TV debates.A source who worked with the President in the past said: “It is going to be a very different campaign than in 2011. Back then it was run by Labour people. He is keen to be seen as Independent and will undoubtedly welcome support from all sides,” he said.Meanwhile, businessman Gavin Duffy may secure his crucial fourth county council nomination on Thursday.

Photograph: Ken Williams Less than 100 years ago, dark skies dominated Ireland. For millennia, the stars guided farmers and helped form our earliest mythologies, while the cyclical movement of the sun inspired the building of major monuments such as Newgrange.Today, light pollution increasingly obscures our view of the stars: studies have shown that there has been an increase of more than 20 per cent in artificial light levels in Ireland over the past 25 years. Scientists say that this is negatively impacting on our health, with sleep disruption and – perhaps less quantifiable – a loss of our sense of place in the universe taking a toll. We now see no more than 300 stars, compared with an estimated 5,000-6,000 in pristine dark-sky regions.“Megalithic monuments were built with a particular purpose in mind,” says Frank Prendergast, former head of the spatial sciences department at the Dublin Institute of Technology. “There was a reason why, for instance, the Boyne Valley passage tombs were constructed, with considerable difficulty, on higher ground, and why they have particular solar alignments.”Prendergast will be a speaker at Pathways to the Cosmos, a one-day conference at Dublin Castle on Saturday, September 15th. Organised by Archaeology Ireland on behalf of the National Monuments Service and the Office of Public Works, it will focus on the alignment of megalithic tombs in Ireland and Atlantic Europe, what the dark sky meant to our ancestors, and why an unobstructed view of the stars is important for communities and tourism today.One of the speakers, Fabio Silva, will show how one particular passage tomb in Portugal was aligned according to the seasonal appearance of Aldebaran, an orange giant star located about 65 years from Earth, and how this star’s appearance indicated it was time to move animals to higher pastures. Closer to home, Prendergast speculates that the appearance of the Pleiades constellation was the trigger for certain post-harvest activities.Today, we appear to be losing a resource our ancestors recognised as very precious. Associate professor of astrophysics at Trinity College Dublin Brian Espey is compiling results from a national survey on night-time light in Ireland. “We use excessive amounts of it,” he says. “People are becoming aware of its effect on their sleep and on wildlife – not to mention the environmental impact of using so much more electricity than we need.”Dunsink Observatory, near Castleknock in Dublin, remains a popular tourist attraction but Espey points out that it is no longer used for professional observing due to light pollution from the city. “We wouldn’t build a multistorey carpark next to Newgrange but we don’t always consider how light from nearby cities could impact on the site. In early results from Espey’s survey, about half of 700 respondents in Ireland said they had been negatively impacted by artificial brightness, both in their own home and outside. But is it too late to turn off the lights?“We can decrease overall luminesce,” says Espey. “Project 2020 commits to trimming and dimming night lights. Commercial and retail light has an impact. We can also look at different levels of light at night: is it really necessary to have residential areas brightly lit at 4am? I appreciate there are concerns about public safety but what we need is better, not more intense, lighting.”He is sceptical of energy-efficient lighting. “Green energy and energy-efficient lighting still use energy. The most efficient option is to turn it off. If light is shining in your window, you can ask the council to turn it down. Lights from homes also leak out into the surrounding area glazed windows and curtains can help.”The night sky is a great way of getting children interested in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) but we’re in danger of losing this invaluable resource, Espey warns. “There are many reasons to tackle light pollution, including tourism at sites like Newgrange and dark sky astronomical events. You can be in the Céide Fields sitting in the huts and getting lost in the night sky it is the best way to get an intimate connection with our history and our culture. The skies are always there and they are accessible to all, but I fear they will be gone and it will be too late.” He adds: “Turning down the lights will improve our health, aid wildlife, reduce energy usage, boost tourism and save something very precious.”Maynooth University PhD student Michael Cleary Gaffney is carrying out a survey on the effects of light-at-night on human health. To participate, go to goo.gldGNwzv Cities are usually visible from afar: just follow the bright orange orb that radiates into space. Since 2001, the International Dark-Sky Association has established more than 100 dark sky places worldwide, although many places fall outside this designation.Some of the world’s best places to view the night sky include:The Atacama desert, Chile: Tourism is the main industry in the small desert town of San Pedro de Atacama in northern Chile. The biggest draw is the night sky and the clear views of the Milky Way, which can be clearly seen even within the town. It’s not just the lack of light pollution spilling in from surrounding areas: the world’s driest desert is situated well above sea-level and clouds are exceptionally rare. Dozens of companies offer star-gazing tours. They’re worthwhile, especially for the views from the telescopes, but this journalist found that taking a bike to the edge of town any given evening also offered a spectacular light show.The Arabian peninsula: Most of Saudi Arabia is empty desert and, as the Empty Quarter is free of humans, it’s also free of artificial light and offers excellent stargazing opportunities. Standing by the Wabar volcanic crater (250m deep and 2km in diameter) while staring up at the Milky Way was a particularly humbling experience.Ireland’s dark sky reserves: No need to take a plane. The International Dark- Sky Association has designated 700sq km of Kerry as a dark sky reserve, taking in an area from Cahersiveen to Valentia Island (see KerryDarkSky for details). In Mayo, the International Dark-Sky Park runs from the Nephin Mountains to the Atlantic the Mayo Dark-Sky Festival will run from November 2nd-4th and includes workshops, talks, walks and stargazing – MayoDarkSkyFestival.ieHonourable mentions: La Palma in the Canary Islands, the Australian Outback, Namibia, Wyoming (US), Hawaii."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3627148.1536771811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nightmare scenario for european elections is now on the cards","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatteo Salvini: observers suggest he could easily be prevailed on to stand for the presidency of the European Commission. Photograph: Massimo PercossiEPAWith elections to the European Parliament looming in May 2019, the plenary this week in Strasbourg, the beginning of the last session before MEPs face the people, was inevitably dominated by a determination to make the place appear relevant, energetic and sensitive to popular concerns.But underlying much of the discussions was the recurring theme of the seemingly irresistible electoral rise of the populist, nationalist right and the neo-fascist far-right. That reality was confirmed by the success of the Sweden Democrats last weekend, although the party’s gains were less dramatic than predicted .Parliament’s fightback was reflected in a first for MEPs, the move to invoke against Hungary the EU’s Article 7 disciplinary procedure to deal with member states who stray from European values and the rule of law. It saw the country’s defiant and combative prime minister, Viktor Orbán, come here to engage with MEPs in person.As MEPs voted on Wednesday by a substantial majority to invoke Article 7, what was clear was the depth of anger at both Orbán’s determination, in the name of Christian purity, to keep out migrants, and his attacks on freedom of the press, NGOs, educational rights and democratic values.That is the case even within the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), where the membership of Orbán’s Fidesz is a cause of serious embarrassment.The party’s expulsion from the EPP is now believed inevitable. Manfred Weber, the EPP’s group leader and Spitzenkandidat (candidate for the European Commission presidency), warned that “We expect the Hungarian government to make a move towards their EU partners ... Fundamental values must be respected by all.”\u0026nbspThe EPP’s reluctance so far to deal robustly with the Hungarian problem is in no small measure a function of the political landscape emerging for the European Parliament elections and notably the growth of the right. The Spitzenkandidat system, under which European Parliament party groups name their lead candidate for the commission job and then expect reluctant national leaders to forsake their own prerogative to endorse the candidate who emerges with the largest vote, is a natural fit for the EPP as the parliament’s largest force.But with the emergence of Emmanuel Macron in France eclipsing its French member-party, Les Républicains, the loss of the Hungarian bloc could also squeeze the party electorally and jeopardise its position, not to mention Weber’s ambitions.Indeed a nightmare Spitzenkandidat scenario is being widely touted – that a cross-Europe alliance of the nationalist and far-right parties around their own Spitzenkandidat could,\u0026nbspwith a fair wind, pass out the EPP and other parties to present the European leaders with a Eurosceptic commission president nomination.Some suggest that a candidate best able to carry that flag for the right would be Italy’s deputy prime minister and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Liga anti-immigrant party, which is in coalition with the Five Star Movement.Salvini clearly has a European vocation and, observers suggest, could easily be prevailed on to stand. He recently met Orbán to discuss a joint anti-immigrant front and claimed they were “walking down the same path”.He then signed up in Brussels to join “the Movement”, the organisation that US alt-right, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon hopes will provide a forum for Europe’s ided far right.An expanded populist representation in the parliament will\u0026nbspmake building legislative alliances more difficult and would promise a turbulent term. But a victory for their Spitzenkandidat nomination, whether Salvini or another, would certainly prompt a major political crisis. Such a candidate would prove completely unacceptable to European leaders, who would certainly find another candidate for the commission job.The parliament has pledged, however, that it will not ratify any commission president who does not emerge from the Spitzenkandidat system. How a centre rightleft majority of MEPs, which will certainly emerge from the elections, will execute a dramatic U-turn to block a Salvini-like commission candidacy will prove interesting.This week in Strasbourg also saw an impassioned appeal from the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to “progressive” parties to form a common platform for the elections. Tsipras said it “will be more than just one more election, it will be a combat on the basis of principles and values”, with pro-EU forces squaring off against “extreme neoliberalism and far-right populism”.“We should not let Europe slide back into the past.”His call is unlikely to be heeded."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3627190.1536774284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit paper a lost opportunity for brexiteers to outmanoeuvre may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP and European Research Group (ERG) chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg (left) listens as Britain’s former Brexit minister David Davis (right) speaks during a meeting of the pro-Brexit ERG in central London on Thursday. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesAsked about the European Research Group’s (ERG) proposal on Northern Ireland on Wednesday, Downing Street’s first response was to say it was the wrong way to ensure that the Border remained open.“We don’t believe that the answer is to move the Border,” a spokesman said.The ERG report didn’t actually propose moving the Border but No 10, in common with much of Westminster, had clearly expected that it would include a plan to check goods at British ports before they travel to Northern Ireland. This would have chimed with Michel Barnier’s proposals for a “de-dramatised” backstop, applying strictly technical and operational checks before goods cross the Irish Sea from east to west, with no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.Jacob Rees-Mogg said at the start of Wednesday’s launch that the report reflected his desire to address the Border issue from the EU’s point of view and David Davis said it was designed to unlock the negotiations. Instead of a bold proposal, however, the paper offered little more than the same administrative and technological fixes that have been doing the rounds for two years and have been rejected by the EU and Ireland as both unrealistic and inadequate.This was a lost opportunity for the Brexiteers to outmanoeuvre Theresa May by disentangling the issue of the Border from the argument over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU. Most of the Brexiteers want a Canada-style free trade agreement and they know that a no-deal Brexit could be economically catastrophic.A deal on the backstop would unlock the negotiations on a withdrawal agreement, guaranteeing Britain a transition period until the end of 2020 during which nothing will change. It would also remove one of the prime minister’s strongest arguments against a Canada-style deal: that it doesn’t deal with Northern Ireland.The ERG lost their nerve, just as the group’s internal isions surfaced after a few dozen of them spent Tuesday evening publicly plotting to overthrow the prime minister. Rees-Mogg and Davis were quick to proclaim their support for May on Wednesday and the Brexiteer mutiny appears to have been snuffed out for now.The DUP endorsed the ERG Border proposal within minutes of its publication, a move the party might have been wiser to consider for longer. As the Brexit negotiations enter their final weeks and the DUP needs the ear and the support of the prime minister, it has sought to embarrass her for no apparent reason by backing a proposal with little merit and no future."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

man hashtag shows early humans capable abstract","story":"Researchers work inside Blombos Cave on South Africa\u0026#39s southern coastThe earliest ever human drawing was a complex ‘hashtag’, scientists have found, proving man was capable of abstract thought far earlier than previously thought.Consisting of three red lines cross-hatched with six separate lines, the sketch was intentionally drawn on a smooth silcrete flake about 73,000 years ago. It was found in Blombos Cave in the southern Cape in South Africa and predates previous drawing from Africa, Europe and Southeast Asia by at least 30,000 years. The slice of rock containing the drawing was discovered by archaeologist Dr Luca Pollarolo, of the University of the Witwatersrand, who at first thought the crossed lines were a natural feature.But after studying thousands of similar flakes, Dr Pollarolo and Professor Christopher Henshilwood, who has been excavating the cave since 1991, concluded they could only have been made intentionally, probably with an ocher crayon.“Before this discovery, Palaeolithic archaeologists have for a long time been convinced that unambiguous symbols first appeared when Homo sapiens entered Europe, about 40 000 years ago, and later replaced local Neanderthals, said Prof Henshilwood. The earliest known drawing in history a red, cross-hatched pattern has been unearthed in South AfricaRecent archaeological discoveries in Africa, Europe and Asia, in which members of our team have often participated, support a much earlier emergence for the production and use of symbols. The team also examined and photographed the piece under a microscope to establish whether the lines were part of the stone or if they had been added later. And after confirming the lines were applied to the stone, the team experimented with various paint and drawing techniques and found that the drawings were made with an ochre crayon, with a tip of between 1 and 3 millimetres thick.The abrupt termination of the lines at the edge of the flake also suggests that the pattern originally extended over a larger surface, and may have been far more complex.The earliest known engraving, a zig-zag pattern, incised on a fresh water shell from Trinil, Java, was found in layers dated to 540 000 years ago and a recent article has proposed that painted representations in three caves of the Iberian Peninsula were 64,000 years old and therefore produced by Neanderthals. It means the drawing on the Blombos silcrete flake the oldest drawing by Homo sapiens ever found.The ability to produce symbols is thought to be a crucial part of humanity, eventually allowing the development of language and writing. The archaeological layer in which the Blombos drawing was found also yielded other examples of symbolic thinking, such as shell beads covered with ochre, and, pieces of ochres engraved with abstract patterns. Some of these engravings closely resemble the one drawn on the silcrete flake.This demonstrates that early Homo sapiens in the southern Cape used different techniques to produce similar signs on different media, added Prof Henshilwood. This observation supports the hypothesis that these signs were symbolic in nature and represented an inherent aspect of the behaviourally modern world of these African Homo sapiens, the ancestors of all of us today.The research was published in the journal Nature.Please review our commenting policyPussy Riot activist in hospital after suspected poisoning, say friends and family\u0026#39Miracle\u0026#39 boy survives falling face first on to

nationalist afd party tactics fascism belong","story":"Martin Schulz, the former leader of the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD), hit out at the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after weeks of tensions over far-Right protestsAlternative for Germany (AfD)The nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is using the “tactics of fascism” and “belongs on the dunghill of history”, rival MPs charged on Wednesday as they rounded on the party in parliament after weeks of simmering tensions over far-Right protests.Alexander Gauland, the AfD leader, tried to use a budget debate to criticise Angela Merkel’s handling of riots which followed the suspected killing of a man by migrants in the east German city of Chemnitz.But instead he and his party came under the most sustained attack from their rivals since becoming the first nationalists to sit in the German parliament since the sixties.At one point the AfD’s 94 MPs staged a mass walk-out after coming under a steady barrage of criticism.In an impassioned and uncharacteristic outburst, Martin Schulz, the former leader of the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD), rounded on remarks by Mr Gauland a few months ago in which the AfD leader described the crimes of the Nazis were “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 glorious years of German history”. “Well, Mr Gauland, the quantity of birds*** amounts to a dunghill, and you belong on the dunghill of German history,” Mr Schulz said.Comparing the AfD’s rhetoric against migrants directly with that of the Nazis, Mr Schulz accused the party of seeking to make migrants into scapegoats for all of Germany’s problems.“The reduction of complex issues to a single group of people is the classic tactic of fascism. This has happened before in this house. It’s time for democrats to stand up and fight back,” the former SPD leader said to a standing ovation from fellow MPs.German MPs gave Mr Schulz a standing ovation after his impassioned and uncharacteristic outburstEarlier, Mr Gauland had accused Mrs Merkel of causing far-Right protests in Chemnitz with her migrant policy.“The internal peace of our country is endangered and a rift goes through our society,” he said.The AfD leader distanced himself from neo-Nazis who were filmed giving the Hitler salute but claimed they were a minority and that most of the protestors were “ordinary citizens”.He accused Mrs Merkel of spreading “fake news” when she spoke of foreigners being attacked during the protests, despite video footage which appears to confirm the claim.Mrs Merkel told the house she understood people’s anger, but refused to back down. “There is no excuse and no justification for hate speech, Nazi slogans or assaults on people who look different,” she said.Alternative for Germany (AfD)Please review our commenting policyPussy Riot activist in hospital after suspected poisoning, say friends and family\u0026#39Miracle\u0026#39 boy survives falling face first on to meat skewerDivorcing women should be shown value of their husband\u0026#39s pension, Age UK says  Parents of stillborn babies given legal right to paid bereavement leave for first timeAny foreign worker with \u0026#39bona fide skills\u0026#39 free to come to UK under Labour, Diane Abbot to announceJean-Claude Juncker calls on EU to become global power\u0026#39Skype calls for all\u0026#39 in revolution on GP servicesMichael Gove\u0026#39s reforms could see horsemeat reappear in the British food chain after Brexit, farmers warnComment: \u0026#39Brexit means the Agriculture Bill matters to the public just as much as it does to the farmer in the field\u0026#39Prince Charles almost lost his Hong Kong handover speech after cleaner threw it in a binComment: A conspiracy of silence surrounds the true threat to Brexit  Britain will not pay Brexit orce bill if there is no deal, Dominic Raab warns BrusselsComment: Britain need not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit -

The survey’s authors said this reflected the uncertainty around Britain’s\u0026nbspdeparture next year.“We are getting closer and closer to exit day and we still don’t know whether London will be able to trade with all the other European financial centres,” Mark Yeandle, co-creator of the index, said.“The fear of losing business to other centres is driving the slight decline and people are concerned about London’s competitiveness.”Since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, some of the world’s most powerful finance companies have started moving staff from London to countries that will remain in the bloc to preserve the existing cross-border flow of trading.Financial services firms, which account for about 12 per cent of Britain’s economic output and pay more tax than any other industry, potentially have a lot to lose from the end of unfettered access to the EU.About 5,000 roles are expected to be shifted from London or created in the EU due to Brexit by March, a Reuters study published earlier this year found.The head of the City of London predicted in July that 3,500 to 12,000 financial jobs would go because of Brexit in the short-term and more might disappear later.Asian competitors are closing in, with Hong Kong only three points behind London, the survey found.Many London executives have warned\u0026nbspthe biggest threats to London are not from other European centres but from global competitors, such as New York and Hong Kong.The rankings, which are based on nearly 2,500 respondents working in the industry, provide a twice-yearly guide to the relative performance of financial centres globally.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ideInternal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape. The Uxbridge MP has repeatedly criticised Ms May’s Chequers plan and used a newspaper article on Sunday to suggest it amounted to “wrapping a suicide vest around the British constitution”.

This marks one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics.

He delivered the Leave vote, Remainers and wannabe future PMs hate him.”Andrew Bridgen said Ms May was to blame for her leadership problems.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, warned Ms May the Conservatives faced a catastrophic split if she did not jettison her Chequers plan.The deep isions on the Tory benches were laid bare as Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee and is a possible leadership rival to Mr Johnson, also hit out at the former foreign secretary.Alistair Burt, another Foreign Office minister who worked in Mr Johnson’s team, said: “I’m stunned at the nature of this attack.

Most major US, British and Japanese banks said they would build up operations in Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.Other European centres moved up in the global rankings. Zurich rose to ninth place from 16th six months ago and Frankfurt to 10th from 20th, while Amsterdam climbed to 35th place from 50th.“London and New York have long vied for the top spot of this index and the uncertainty around the future shape of Brexit is likely to be a factor in their latest switch in positions,” said Miles Celic, chief executive of the lobbying group TheCityUK. “In a competitive world we cannot afford complacency.”A Bank of England official expressed optimism on Wednesday about the future.“The big point...regardless of what happens with Brexit is that Britain will remain a global financial centre,” Alex Brazier, the central bank’s executive director for financial stability, told WalesOnline.“There may be some jobs moving as firms execute their contingency plans, but I don’t expect the big picture to change.”Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

Anything you want to publish will need to first be approved by these filters, perfectly legal content like parodies \u0026amp memes will be caught in the crosshairs, she wrote on Twitter.Article 11 introduces a so-called link tax. That will mean that companies like Google and Facebook could have to pay news organisations to use their headlines on their sites, for instance, which campaigners claim could undermine some of the most central technologies of the internet.All of the rules have received sustained critiicsm from both the big technology platforms as well as internet campaigners. But they have been supported by the big companies in the media industries, as well as some of their biggest stars including musicians like Paul McCartney.But some musicians argued that the rules could actually hurt their industry, by stifling the ability to collaborate.Musicians and artists thrive when they collaborate and share, said Wyclef Jean, who is in Strasbourg arguing against the rules.\u0026nbspI’ve worked with so many young artists – the future – who have sampled my music and succeeded. Upload filters or anything else that restricts this will stop artists from making and creating the future.The rules will now progress through the rest of the legislative process, which will include a final vote in January, which is likely to see the rules passed. EU members will then choose how to enforce the directive in their own laws.The new version of the rules included hundreds of changes that have been made since the parliament rejected them in July, such as allowing exemptions for the very smallest tech companies. But campaigners argue the substance of the new directive is the same, including the parts referred to as a link tax and the controversial automated filters.Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

That phone has the biggest ever display on an iPhone – while it is roughly the same size phone as the Plus-sized phones, it has a much bigger display.On both phones, the camera is vastly improved, according to Apple. Though the hardware didn\u0027t seem to have changed, it relies on the new\u0026nbspA12\u0026nbspbionic chip that powers the rest of the phone to take much better photos and videos.Both the XS and XS Max are also stubbornly waterproof, and Apple said that they can even be dropped into beer and will continue to work.Apple said the technology inside the phone will help improve the experiences that people can have with, and showed those off using a range of app developers. It invited Bethesda on stage to introduce a new Elder Scrolls game, for instance, and basketball app\u0026nbspHomecourt\u0026nbspshowed how it can use the augmented reality features to help people practise shooting.Apple is currently unable to embed an\u0026nbspeSIM\u0026nbspinto its devices in China, so they will release a special iPhone XS and XS Max for the country. With these versions, you will be able to insert two\u0026nbspSIM\u0026nbspcards at once.The iPhone XS starts at $999, or the same in pounds -- the exact same price as the X went on sale for last year.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

referred to as a\u0026nbsp“hashtag” in the scientific journal where the study will be published -\u0026nbspthe archaeologists say they have identified a piece that predates previous attempts at abstract drawing by at least 30,000 years.Among the layer of archaeological debris in which the drawing was unearthed, the team also found more evidence of these early humans’ capacity for symbolic thinking.The same ochre that was used to scratch lines on the rock fragment was also used to coat shell beads.On top of this, they found still more pieces of ochre that themselves had been engraved with abstract patterns closely resembling the ones drawn on the stone.\u0026nbsp“This demonstrates that early Homo sapiens in the southern Cape used different techniques to produce similar signs on different media,” said Professor Christopher Henshilwood, who led the study and has been excavating the Blombos Cave since 1991.“This observation supports the hypothesis that these signs were symbolic in nature and represented an inherent aspect of the behaviourally modern world of these African Homo sapiens, the ancestors of all of us today.”The findings were welcomed by professor Alistair Pike, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton who has previously identified art nearly as old as the Blombos stone, but made by Neanderthals.“It’s very exciting but also not very surprising given the amount of symbolic activity that has already been found in the cave,” professor Pike, who was not involved in the new study, told The Independent.However, while there is a chance the scratched ochre discovered in the cave could have been produced in a purely functional way, he said the drawing itself is unambiguously a piece of art.Blombos Cave in the same archaeological debris that yielded the silcrete flake (ErricoHenshilwoodNature)It also ties together the various engravings and beads from around this period with the elaborate cave paintings made by our more recent ancestors.Professor Pike noted that even though this simple piece may appear to be the sign of a more primitive brain, in fact the person who created it would have been no less developed than the creators of the elaborate animal drawings made in Europe thousands of years later.“I guess you can contrast a Jackson Pollock painting with a Giotto and say gosh, those are two very different things – but they are formed by the same symbolic processes and meanings,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/POLITICS-Brexit-City-071016-0.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/POLITICS-Brexit-City-071016-0.jpg","title":"brexit eu uk single market theresa may plan jean claude juncker","story":"Created with Sketch.EU president says Chequers proposals can be a \u0027starting point\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: EU can \u0027certainly not\u0027 accept Theresa May\u0027s single market plan, Juncker warnsJean-Claude Juncker has given his clearest signal yet that the EU will not accept Theresa May’s plan to keep Britain in the single market for goods after Brexit.In his annual state of the union address in Strasbourg, the European Commission president said parts of the single market could “certainly not” be jettisoned for countries outside the bloc.But he said the Chequers proposals could be a “starting point” for the future relationship and that Britain would “never be an ordinary” country for the EU.“We respect the British decision to leave our union, even though we continue to regret it deeply,” he told MEPs.“But we also ask the British government to understand that someone who leaves the union cannot be in the same privileged position as a member\u0026nbspstate.“If you leave the union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.”Ms May proposed that Britain sign up to a “common rulebook”, effectively keeping British goods in the single market – but without accepting regulations for services, the European Court of Justice\u0026nbspor free movement. The aim of the plan was to allow frictionless trade to continue between the EU and UK after Brexit.If you leave the Union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.Mr Juncker\u0026nbspdescribed the conduct of his chief negotiator Michel Barnier as “masterful” and reiterated that the official\u0026nbsphad the “unanimous” support of EU member states – who Britain has tried to split off in order to get a better deal, so far unsuccessfully.\u0026nbspThe president’s rejection, which echoes the position of Mr Barnier and diplomats from\u0026nbspmember states, could raise the prospect of\u0026nbspBritain exiting without a deal, because UK government ministers have been clear that they view the choice in talks as one between Chequers and\u0026nbspno deal.Elsewhere in his wide-ranging speech, Mr Juncker, whose term ends after the next European elections in spring 2019, said the EU could easily “impose its position on others” when it spoke with one voice.“When we are united we Europeans, as a union, have become a force to be reckoned with that you cannot do without. Some in Europe were unhappy with the agreement that I reached with President Trump. Some were surprised by it, but there shouldn’t have been a surprise. Whenever Europe speaks as one, we can impose our position on others. Where necessary, Europe must act as one,” he said.‘Poor quality’ Brexit plans at key department risks billions of poundsUK will reject any EU offer of a ‘blind Brexit’, says HammondMay’s Brexit plan ‘substantially worse’ than status quo, says JohnsonThird of UK export firms have already lost business due to BrexitIn what might be interpreted as a veiled dig at British plans to set up its own satellite system after it leaves the EU, Mr Juncker said: “No single member state would’ve been able to launch the satellites that 400 million users around the world are already benefiting from. No member state could have done that on its own.”Elsewhere in the speech Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid his commission would bring forward new rules to ensure elections free from third-party interference, and outlined plans for enhanced trade between the EU and Africa.He also suggested reforms to the EU’s governance structures,\u0026nbspscrapping the requirement for unanimous European Council votes on taxation and foreign policy. That plan is likely to face significant opposition from members states, some of whom are likely to view it as a power-grab.In a veiled reference to US president Donald Trump, he also warned: “Europe can no longer be assured that the commitments entered into in the past will still be respected in the future. Yesterday’s alliances may no longer be tomorrow’s alliances. Today’s world needs a strong united Europe.”Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid he wanted to continue work on European defence integration, but denied he was creating an EU army.“If Europe were to unite all the political, economic and military might of its nations, its role in the world could be strengthened,” he said.“This is why – despite great resistance at the time – I reignited the idea of a Europe of Defence as early as 2014. And this is why I will continue to work day and night over the next months to see the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation in Defence become fully operational. Allow me to clarify one important point: we will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It’s a big one.”With the potentially deadly conditions of Florence around 500 miles away from land, North Carolina residents who decided to stay at home made last minute preparations by\u0026nbspstocking up on dwindling emergency supplies.“My message is clear: disaster is at the doorstep and is coming in,” North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said on Wednesday morning. “The waves and the wind this storm may bring is nothing like you’ve ever seen. Even if you’ve ridden out storms before, this one is different. Don’t bet your life on riding out a monster.”At the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Washington, officials were asked about a report that revealed the Trump administration had shifted nearly $10m\u0026nbsp(£7.7m) from FEMA to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Office of Response and Recovery, said they had all the resources required.He said: “This is not going to be a glancing blow. It’s going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast.”Less than 24 hours before the first signs of the severe winds were expected,\u0026nbsppeople flocked to hardware and food shops to stock up on supplies they hope will help them and their families survive through the worst of the storm, which has shifting between being a category 3 and 4 storm.

It was bad — we watched all the floodwater build. It was scary,” said Ms Powell, who is evacuating to Georgia but bought the generator for her husband, who is staying to help the elderly at their church.As the hurricane barrelled towards the United States this week, governors, mayors, and county leadership in states from South Carolina up to Maryland, began issuing evacuation orders and declaring states of emergency.More than 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate, and broader emergency efforts have included moving prisoners from detention centres considered at risk, and keeping an eye on Superfund sites in the area that could be hit by the storm and spread dangerous chemicals.US insurance industry braces itself for Hurricane Florence falloutFlorence to bring ‘life-threatening, catastrophic flash floods’ Hurricane Florence path changes with path projected towards GeorgiaFEMA has sent officials to embed with state responding offices to ensure that federal efforts to help are coordinated and effective. Mr\u0026nbspTrump, after a series of increasingly stern statements on the storm, declared a state of emergency in North Carolina and Virginia, freeing up federal funds to help in the storm preparation efforts.“Hurricane Florence is looking even bigger than anticipated,” Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “It will be arriving soon. FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready. Be safe!’But,\u0026nbspin spite of the warnings that flooding could wash through North Carolina, posing dangerous risk to life and property, many seem unconcerned.“Basically this is going to be – I just can’t describe it,” Kevin Lynn, of Fayetteville, said.\u0026nbspMr Lynn said that Hurricane Matthew felled trees and flooded his community, leading to lost power and long commutes home. This time he hopes he learned the lesson.“You go, OK –\u0026nbspthis time we’re prepared. This year we learned from previous hurricanes,” Mr Lynn said. “I’m not worried at all... if it’s flooded, people need to stay home. It’s not worth risking your life.”Sergeant Cisco Ramirez, who is stationed at Fort Bragg, had also picked up a generator on Wednesday and said he has no worries about the coming storm. He, his wife, and his two children have fortified their house with sandbags, and stocked up on essentials.“I’ve been through worse I’m not worried about it,” Mr Ramirez said. “It’s just a little rain.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

Did EU have canned applause in Juncker\u0027s State of Union speech?And unless things change, Britain was effectively facing an unpalatable and unacceptable choice between the plague and cholera.Sir Sebastian was referring to the key issue of whether Brexit should result in a \u0026lsquohard border\u0026rsquo for trading and movement of people between Northern Ireland - which is part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland that would stay in the EU.He said: Either we accept that we keep all the obligations, but no longer sitting at the table in Brussels, or there is a hard border between Northern Ireland and the UK. Both options are unthinkable.It is widely feared that a hard border could undermine the fragile peace process in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspLondon wants to maintain a virtual customs union for goods with the EU to avoid this problem.October was supposed to be the deadline for a deal to be agreed, but Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has already admitted this is unrealistic - stoking fears that there could be no deal at all.The situation is complicated by the fact that UK Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Chequers proposals are deeply unpopular within her own party.It is understood around 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against her plans, which they think already make too many concessions.Despite the dramatic situation, Sir Sebastian fears that too many top German officials are kidding themselves into assuming that there will still be either a friendly settlement or a second UK referendum with a different outcome.

We do not believe that the EU and the UK will be able to come to an agreement in six months on what they want in the future. And we do not want to suffer due to the fact that they can not agree.Mr Juncker dismissed Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers agreement proposal that Britain should stay close to the EU in trading goods, but go its own way on services.He said: \u0026ldquoWe respect the British decision to leave our union, even though we continue to regret it deeply.

If you earn money from a community, you should pay your share of tax to that community.I was in business, and I know that, within limits, it\u0027s right and proper for people to arrange their tax affairs, and for companies to do so.But when vast companies like Amazon, and other online traders, the new industries, can get away with paying almost nothing in tax, there is something wrong with the tax system.He went on: Let us not delude ourselves into thinking that the gig economy is the only reincarnation of oppression of the vulnerable in employment.Pensions are just one example of the profit motive leading to the weakest being given the most risk and the strongest the most protection.During PMQs, Mrs May put up a stout defence of Universal Credit after Mr Corbyn demanded it was scrapped.Magna Carta, Latin for the Great Charter, is a charter agreed by King John of England at Runnymede, on 15 June 1215. The sealed document was first drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel barons.

Roberta said, \u0026lsquoMy work coach helped turn my life around. He tailored his support to my situation and thanks to him I have found my dream job.\u0026rsquo Ryan said, \u0026lsquoI am happy with the new universal credit.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free.

boosting our mental health.The claims were made by Robin Murphy from the University of Oxford and Matthew Sachs from Hard University.And those who experience the sensation also tend to be in better physical health, are more creative and friendlier than those who don’t, according to the study.Participants in the study watched a 45 minute performance at a summer music festival - 55 per cent said they experienced goose bumps during it and the rest did not.The researchers then asked them about their outlook on life, how empathetic they are, perceptions of their own mental and physical health and more - before comparing the findings.Carried out to celebrate the benefits available to cardholders through Barclaycard Entertainment, the study follows previous studies which identified live music as one the biggest causes of goose bumps.Robin Murphy, associate professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said: “The phenomenon of goose bumps has intrigued us for many years and having the opportunity to test participants in a live setting has certainly provided some food for thought.“The results of the Barclaycard study are the first to show a correlation between different personality traits and people who experience goose bumps.“The evidence suggests that being truly connected with live entertainment and getting goose bumps, has an impact on our overall sense of well-being and mood.”The study found 66 per cent of those who experienced the shivery sensation perceived themselves to be in good emotional and physical health - 46 per cent who didn’t have them said the same.Similarly, more of those who got the tingles  claimed to feel happier after watching the performance than those who did not get them .While 80 per cent who had goose bumps described themselves as ‘empathetic’ and ‘agreeable’ compared to 63 per cent of the sample who didn’t.It also emerged more of those who got goose bumps had a stronger interest in creative activities such as baking, painting and writing.However, more of those who did NOT get goose bumps claimed to be confident than those who DID experience them - 82 per cent compared to 60 per cent.During the experiment, more women  experienced goose bumps than men .And the researchers believe this suggests females tend to make stronger emotional connections to music than males do.A total of 126 goose bump moments were experienced during the study - an average of three moments per minute.And they were found to most commonly occur during the first minute of a song.Barclaycard also commissioned research of 2,000 UK adults where 77 per cent were found to have experienced goose bumps - leaving 23 per cent who NEVER have.However, those who do, experience them six times a month on average – that’s 371 occasions during their lifetime.Among the biggest causes of goose bumps were live entertainment, ‘amazing’ singing voices, guitar solos and crowds singing along together en masse.But the survey also found seven in 10 UK adults have no idea what purpose the tingly sensation serves.Daniel Mathieson, head of experiential marketing at Barclaycard, said: “Most of us can relate to experiencing goose bumps when watching live entertainment.And now we have a clear understanding of why this happens and what it means for us as individuals.“The results reflect the overwhelmingly positive impact music and live entertainment can have on our lives ranging from health and happiness to overall wellbeing.“It’s truly exciting to be part of the first ever scientific study of its kind.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433265964.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"home and garden shop the range apologises over rocking zombie child halloween display after parents complain its terrifying kids","story":"The ghoulish figure, which has no eyes, left young kids jumping out of their skin at The Range in Plymstock, near Plymouth, Devon.Mum Lisabeth Jones, 36, was shopping with for storage boxes with her children, aged two and six, when she spotted the horror show.She told Plymouth Live: I was disturbed by these models, let alone them .I’m praying it doesn’t cause them nightmares.Lisabeth complained to the customer services over the dead child exhibit, which rocks as you walk past it.In a message on a Facebook, she added: My two-year-old jumped out of his skin when one of them moved.Parents have slammed the home and garden shop over the exhibit, that also features a giant skeleton and a red clown.This is too much to be displayed in such a prominent position.Please reconsider to ensure it is child-appropriate.Other parents have taken to social media to vent their outrage at the display.One dad wrote: I have felt unable to go to the range with my children for several years in October but starting this early is a real disappointment.Clearly we can’t go shopping in The Range until November.Another parent said: This is absolutely over the top.

Logistics experience not required.The whole process can take as little as four weeks at which point they are put into a system and assigned routes.Each route for a single driver has a daily volume of between 250 and 300 packages on average, but drivers said it could be as high as 400 during peak periods.Amazon also provides the electronic devices — known internally as rabbits — that drivers use for scanning each package and route navigation.Courier companies pay drivers either a flat rate of between 125  and 150  a day or an hourly rate of between 13  and 15  an hour, according to drivers.The drivers are supposed to get 30-minute lunch breaks and two additional 15-minute breaks  during their day but say that stopping to eat or use the loo would make them fall behind.Ann Chval said female drivers at Tennessee-based JARS TD, where she was a driver in 2017, brought buckets and baby wipes to work so they could pee in their trucks.Marvic Trejo, a driver who has worked for two companies delivering packages for Amazon, said: Its disgusting.Theres no place in society to have people p***ing in a bottle.”Drivers also claimed they were frequently not paid for overtime with one Texas based firm admitting they didn’t pay drivers overtime for at least a year.Others claimed they felt powerless to address problems at work fearing they would be fired or have their wages docked.Justin Waring, a former driver, told Business Insider: If I didnt come in on my day off, they threatened to fire me.”When contacted by The Sun Online, an Amazon spokesperson referred to the statements it had issued to Business Insider.These read: While it is impossible to characterise a network of thousands of delivery drivers based on anecdotes, we do recognise small businesses sometimes need more support when scaling fast.We have worked with our partners, listened to their needs, and have implemented new programs to ensure small delivery businesses serving Amazon customers have the tools they need to deliver a great customer and employee experience.Our recently launched Delivery Service Partner program offers a number of new features including customized branded vehicles for delivery, preventative vehicle maintenance services, low-cost vehicle and employee insurance plans, and a payroll system customized for their business.We are simultaneously recruiting new businesses into this program and transitioning our existing delivery partners into this new program.Hundreds of delivery associates are working full-time jobs that offer competitive pay and comprehensive benefits through their delivery service provider.Amazon requires all delivery service providers to abide by applicable laws and Amazons Supplier Code of Conduct, which focuses on fair wages, appropriate working hours and compensation,“We investigate any claim that a provider isnt complying.The majority of drivers complete their daily routes in under nine hours, which factor in breaks, traffic patterns, and more.And in cases where inclement weather or traffic may impact a drivers ability to complete a customer delivery on time, Amazon works closely with delivery service providers to make adjustments to their delivery route and, if necessary, DSPs call drivers to return to the station.Earlier this year it was revealed warehouse workers in the UK faced similar pressures and conditions.One ex-worker said staff fear getting into trouble for taking too long away from the job.The warehouse measures 700,000 sq ft and some of the 1,200 workers face a ten minute, quarter-of-a-mile walk to two toilets on the ground floor of the four-storey building.Undercover investigator James Bloodworth said: “For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs.”Mr Bloodworth, who worked ten-hour shifts as a picker selecting goods for despatch, walked ten miles a day in the job to research for a book on low-wage Britain.It meant workers operated a “toilet bottle” system.Mr Bloodworth said: “People just peed in bottles because they lived in fear of being ­disciplined over ‘idle time’ and ­losing their jobs just because they needed the loo.”The Sun Online has approached Amazon for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000073872019-e1536748405904.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wetherspoons jagermeister hennessy courvoisier

regions there are major inequalities - such as in London, where Croydon and Hounslow have high benefits rates while Richmond and Bromley are strikingly low in claimant numbers.In Scotland, Glasgow is notably more affected by unemployment than Edinburgh, according to the data.The stats combine Jobseekers Allowance with those on the new Universal Credit system who are claiming while seeking employment.They do not include other types of benefit such as those linked to illness or disability.Birmingham Ladywood became notorious after Benefits Street was aired in 2014.The Channel 4 show

Cooper and his wife Susan lost their lives within hours of each other at Aqua Magic hotel in the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada on 21 August.A public prosecutor in Egypt confirmed the lethal bacteria was a factor in the tragic couples demise as he detailed an official medical report.An inspection of the couples hotel room revealed there were no toxic or harmful gas emissions or leaks but prosecutor Nabil Sadek said forensic tests showed John, 69, suffered acute intestinal dysentery caused by E.coli.Susan, 64, had suffered Hemolytic-uremic syndrome , likely because of E.coli.Thomas Cook had already confirmed high levels of E.coli were found in food at the Egypt hotel where the couple died.The travel giant revealed the results of independent tests conducted at the Steigenberger showed the presence of the food poison bug - as well as bacteria linked to sepsis and deadly toxic shock syndrome.Experts analysing food and hygiene standards at the resort identified a high level of E.coli and staphylococcus bacteria.The couple, from Burnley, Lancs, died within hours of each other at their Hurghada resort.Their deaths were initially recorded as being down to heart and respiratory failure — but a postmortem proved this not to be the case.The bodies have now been released  for repatriation by the Egyptian authorities and once the bodies are back in the UK, authorities here will carry out their own post-mortem.Egypts ministry for tourism released a statement saying it hoped the post-mortem result would help the grieving family come to terms with the tragic loss and end speculative suggestions.John, 69 died in his room after collapsing on his bed, while wife Susan, 64, was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to the then mystery illness.A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said: “Thomas Cook notes the announcement today by the Egyptian prosecutor on the results of the autopsies of John and Susan Cooper following their deaths at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic in Hurghada on 21 August 2018.We have not yet seen the full report and we will need time for our own experts to review it.“We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper. We will continue to offer every support to their daughter Kelly and the rest of their family.”Following the deaths Thomas Cook moved 300 customers out of the hotel.Escherichia coli is a type of bacteria common in human and animal intestines.While most types of E.coli are harmless some can cause serious food poisoning and infection.Some E.coli strains produce toxins  that can cause severe illness.A particular life-threatening complication called haemolytic uremic syndrome  may develop in 5-10 per cent of people infected with a toxin-producing form of E.coli.This is a severe kidney-related complication that may, in extreme cases, lead to renal failure and the need for renal replacement therapy.Egypts tourism minister Dr Rania al-Mashat said: The autopsy reports published today by Egypt’s Attorney General Nabil Sadek are one more step forward towards helping the grieving Cooper family come to terms with the tragic loss of John and Susan.The causes of death, e-coli bacteria, were medically determined by a team of internationally accredited pathologists, which I hope for the family’s sake will put an end to previous speculative suggestions of what might have happened.The health and safety of all tourists to Egypt are absolutely paramount and I am determined, together with the Prime Minister Dr Mostafa Madbouly and our fellow Ministers to ensure the highest standards of well-being for all visitors to our country.We will review the Attorney General’s autopsy reports in fine detail to determine our next course of action to look after the welfare of our visitors."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433254097.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may rejects vladimir putins claim salisbury prime suspects are civilians","story":"The Prime Ministers official spokesman reiterated the UK’s position that they were in fact Russian spies “who used a devastatingly toxic illegal chemical weapon on the streets of our country”.It comes after Moscow’s president said there is nothing criminal about Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are said to be behind the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal.British authorities believe the pair smeared the highly toxic chemical Novichok on a door handle at the Wiltshire home of the ex-KGB officer.Both Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill, along with DS Nick Bailey, the policeman who attended to them.The perfume bottle the members of Russian military intelligence service the GRU used to transport the Novichok was found three months later, killing Dawn Sturgess and hospitalising her partner Charlie Rowley.But despite a raft of evidence implicating Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov, Mr Putin made the claim they were not behind the poisoning.In an address to the Easter Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he said: Of course, we looked who these people are. We know who they are, we have found them already.He added: There is nothing special and nothing criminal about it, Im telling you.Questioned on whether the pair were civilians, he replied: Of course they are civilians.In response Mrs May’s spokesman said: We have repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury in March and they have replied with obfuscation and lies.I have seen nothing to suggest that has changed.Earlier today it was reported Mr Petrov will break his silence on the accusations next week, according to television station Russia 24.Mr Putin appeared to approve of such an intervention, saying: I hope that they will emerge  themselves and tell about themselves. It will be better for everyone.Detectives believe it is likely the two Salisbury suspects, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Mr Petrov and Mr Boshirov are not their real names.Prosecutors deem it futile to apply to Russia for the extradition of the two men but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.Today the security minister Ben Wallace said they entered the UK from Russia via Gatwick Airport, but said requests for Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury had been met with obfuscation and lies, saying their response merely reinforces their guilt.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why are up to 9 million people in the UK lonely?The truth is there are multiple reasons including technology reducing the need for face-to-face contact although we do acknowledge the power that it has to bring people together as well.There are fewer people participating in community groups or speaking even just to their next-door neighbours.An increasing number of jobs being done remotely or alone, which means that even work is becoming isolating.When we’re talking about younger age groups and their propensity towards loneliness that could be as a consequence to that digital connection and the difference between having a virtual relationship and a real relationship.At the same time, for older people, that access to technology could be the solution to loneliness and isolation.Loneliness has previously been thought to mostly affect the elderly. But a study by the Office for National Statistics found found students are more likely than over-75s to be socially isolated.Figures published in April showed 10% of 16 to 24-year-olds were often or always lonely, compared with just 3% of pensioners.The survey showed 23% of young adults said they were lonely some of the time, falling to 18% for the 25 to 34 age group and to 17% among over-75s.Dr Dawn Snape, from the ONS, yesterday told the Public Health England annual conference that social media is creating new problems for younger generations.She said: This is a pervasive thing and this existed since time immemorial. But there are some new things as well.Children, who are hugely, hugely connected, young people who are hugely connected, within the space of seconds can know that they have been left out of something and can see it happening in real time.That they are being left out of something that their friends are doing, that is happening right now and they are sitting there for three hours watching their friends at a party knowing everything that is happening at the party that they haven’t been invited to.I think that’s the first generation that has had to deal with that, and the repercussions of that.I have children aged 16 and 18 and talking to them about it, they say definitely it is horrifying.You are watching this happening and you feel terribly lonely... the desperation of feeling that you have been left out of a friendship group.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you’ve got nothing better to do, go and find yourself some work, because that’s the best cure for stupid personality nonsense”.Other senior Leavers also pledged their loyalty to Mrs May, for now.ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg dubbed the PM “worthy of our support”, adding: “I have long said that the policy needs to be changed, but I am supporting the person”.Brexiteer loyalist Cabinet minister Michael Gove also warned the angry rebels that their scheming is putting Brexit itself at risk.The Environment Secretary implored: ““The critical thing is we need to make sure we have unity in the Conservative Party behind the Prime Minister’s proposition.“This is loose talk. Any diversion or distraction from that mission means our ability to deliver on the referendum mandate is undermined.”Other Brexiteers claimed the ERG hot heads were allowed to run riot at the meeting as most of its more senior figures were not there – including Bernard Jenkin, David Davis, Owen Patterson, Boris Johnson and IDS, as well as Mr Rees-Mogg himself.No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

There would be “equivalence” of UK and EU regulations for the safety of agricultural products and the UK would allow Brussels inspectors into Northern Ireland to check their implementation.Goods would be checked at the point of origin and at the point of sale rather than on border. And tiny firms currently exempt would be asked “voluntarily” sign up to VAT in order to track goods shipped across the Irish border.Setting out their “novel” alternative plan, the Brexiteers admitted their solutions were “not ideal” but they insisted they would solve the border headache.Flanked by Lord Trimble, the architect of the Good Friday Agreement, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and two ex-Northern Ireland Secretaries said their plan was “fabulously practical” solution in partnership with a Canada style free trade deal with Brussels.But Owen Paterson was left red faced after claiming the “boring” paper contained “very little new”.DUP chief Nigel Dodds said last night that the ERG paper contained “sensible practical measures which can ensure there will be no hard border.”But Downing Street hit back to say: “We don’t believe that the answer is to move the border.”Later a Whitehall source told The Sun the ERG plan would “hit small business hard” as they were a “bureaucratic nightmare.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I agree with you.“You said twice that we need to come to a free trade deal. It’s what European exporters want and it’s what we want.“Surely now the time is right, the ground is prepared for a Canada plus style trade deal between you and us.“We leave political union but we carry on doing business on a tariff-free basis. We want it, increasingly I think you want it. Let’s get Brexit sorted.”And Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman told The Sun: “President Juncker used his speech to warn Chequers is not acceptable to the EU.“He strongly suggests a free trade agreement such as Super Canada when he talks of a free trade area.“Tusk and Barnier have both offered a 100% tariff and quota free deal that effectively means a free trade area with only some electronic customs forms.“We should accept this offer and we can then deliver a great trade deal for November.”He added: “I very much welcome the new, more flexible approach the EU has taken to the Northern Ireland border.“A creative solution, as Juncker put it, is exactly what we need.”However, EU officials cautioned that British ministers were likely to be disappointed by Brussels’ interpretation of what a free trade area entails.A senior source told The Sun: “The problem with free trade areas is that, like free trade agreements, they’re everything but free trade.“They eliminate many restrictions, but the problem here is whatever type of deal we arrive at, you’ll always end up with a certain degree of friction.During the speech Mr Juncker also had a dig at UK plans to build a rival to the Galileo satellite.He said: “A strong, united Europe will allow its member states to reach for the stars. Europe is still in the space race. No Member State could’ve done that on its own. Galileo is a success story, primarily a European success story. Without Europe there would be no Galileo.”Elsewhere, Mr Juncker said the EU should do away with the need for Member States to agree unanimously on foreign policy decisions and tax laws.But his speech prompted accusations from eurosceptics that he is trying to erode the role of individual countries and create a federal Europe.Mr Farage said: “All of this means less to be done at the nation state level. It’s all about centralisation. Power, power, power.”The EU Parliament said Eurocrats should trigger sanctions which could lead to Budapest’s voting rights in Brussels being revoked.Euro MPs approved a report accusing the regime of migrant abuse, press control, corruption, surveillance and misogyny.Hungary called the decision-making “fraudulent”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am worried this will have a terrible effect on them. My father has been really unwell recently and has heart problems.I spend a lot of time shielding my parents from what is on the internet about Reeva. We dont need pictures of her blood stains to be seen at all after such a long time.The new documentary reveals for the first time that Pistorius received a mysterious picture message shortly before the murder raising questions over whether this sparked a row between the pair.It was previously thought that the blade runner had  launched into a jealous rage after reading a message on Reevas phone.But the production crew obtained phone records showing Pistorius was sent a message at 1.48am on February 14, 2013 - around 10 minutes before a neighbour claimed to have heard shouting from the house.As part of the documentary, journalist Toby Shapshak explains that the message had the equivalent of 58kb of data, and claims it could have been a photograph or a WhatsApp message.It comes after Reevas mother June revealed she has forgiven her daughters killer, adding that she is done with the Paralympian.June Steenkamp told South African newspaper The Citizen: “I am not interested in Oscar Pistorius, I am finished with that.It’s up to the justice system now – I have no interest whatsoever in him. He is not important to me anymore. It has been five years and I have had enough now.”Pistorious was initially found not guilty of her murder, but convicted of culpable homicide and was jailed for five years.But furious prosecutors appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court overturned his conviction, finding him guilty of murder in December 2015, and he was sentenced to six years.In November 2017, Pistorious had his jail sentence increased to 13 years and five months.In March 2018, he lost his appeal against his 13-year sentence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433237387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says conservative party theresa may","story":"No new leader could change the fact this Government has no majority.

And who is reluctant to topple Mrs May with less than 200 days to go until Brexit?\u0027SHE HAS TO GO\u0027A handful of Tory MPs have publicly stated their discontent with Mrs May\u0027s leadership, in the wake of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit.Andrew Bridgen, Andrea Jenkyns and Philip Davies have all submitted letters to the Conservative 1922 committee to state they have no confidence in the prime minister.If a total of 48 MPs do the same, Mrs May will face a vote of no confidence in the first step towards possibly ousting her from the Tory leadership.Nadine Dorries is also among the prime minister\u0027s fiercest critics, recently telling Sky News it is now the \"end of the road\" for Mrs May.\u0027SHE MUST CHUCK CHEQUERS\u0027The European Research Group  of Tory MPs are strident critics of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit plan and are demanding Mrs May \"chuck Chequers\".Their number include those who are also wanting Mrs May to be toppled.However, the official mantra of the ERG is that they want to \"change the policy, not the person\", meaning they are likely to continue to support Mrs May - as long as she backs down over Brexit.Sky News understands ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg was not present at Monday\u0027s meeting where Mrs May\u0027s leadership was discussed, even though former ERG leader Steve Baker chaired the meeting. The ERG was formed in the early 1990s amid eurosceptic anger at the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for the formation of the European Union out of the European Community.Current estimates of the size of the ERG membership y from between 50 to 80.Mr Baker recently claimed 80 Tory MPs would be willing to vote against Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan in the House of Commons.The ERG is partly publicly-funded as one of parliament\u0027s \"pooled services\".MPs who are members of the ERG are allowed to claim from their staffing or office costs their payments to the group, which charges an annual membership fee of \u0026#16320,000.All the other main parties also have their own \"pooled services\" groups.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"He recently called on Mrs May to introduce Donald Trump-style tax cuts in the UK, which fuelled speculation he is laying the ground for a leadership bid.\u0027IT\u0027S THE WORST OF ALL WORLDS\u0027Tory Remainers are also unhappy with the Chequers plan, with MPs such as Justine Greening and Johnny Mercer describing the proposals as \"the worst of all worlds\".They are less robust in their criticism and have not voiced any direct attacks on the prime ministerBut some, such as Ms Greening, have their own uncomfortable history with Mrs May having previously served in her cabinet. The ex-education secretary resigned from government at the beginning of the year after refusing the job of work and pensions secretary in a reshuffle.Ms Greening is calling for a three-way referendum on Brexit a public choice between the Chequers plan, leaving the EU with no deal, or staying in the bloc.Meanwhile, fellow former minister Nick Boles is suggesting the prime minister tries to unite Tories by signing up to a Norway-style relationship with the EU for a short period before chasing a cleaner break afterwards.\u0027ARE WE THE ONES TO REPLACE MAY?\u0027Mrs May\u0027s current ministers are bound to the Chequers deal under government collective responsibility and, therefore, are professing public loyalty to the prime minister.However, a number will no doubt be harbouring their own leadership ambitions, with Sky News being told ministers are privately confiding to backbenchers that Mrs May \"has to go\". Of those currently serving in cabinet, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Environment Secretary Michael Gove are among the bookies\u0027 favourites to be the next Tory leader.Since taking on his role at the Home Office, Mr Javid has shown little reluctance to disagree with the prime minister\u0027s stance on a number of issues.\u0027STOP THE INFIGHTING AND GET ON WITH THE JOB\u0027There are also a number of Conservative MPs and ministers who are fed up with party infighting and manoeuvring at a crucial time in the Brexit negotiations.Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen told Sky News on Wednesday: \"The business of government goes on, we\u0027ve got critical decisions to make in our negotiations in how to leave the EU and we\u0027re getting on with the business of government.\"I don\u0027t recognise any plots or I don\u0027t understand why people would be doing that.

On Thursday the Brexit department will release a fresh raft of technical Brexit papers including one on mobile phone charges. Without a deal sources say phone users could see the return of levies for using mobile devices on the continent. The pro-Europe Best for Britain campaign said the re-imposition of roaming charges could cost business people visiting the EU up to \u0026pound778 a month. Liberal Democrat MP and Best for Britain supporter Layla Moran said: The cost of a hard Brexit on British travellers is becoming abundantly clear.  Millions of people are facing higher costs to make calls and texts abroad because of the Prime Minister\u0027s botched Brexit plans.  Phone roaming and data charges cost British consumers an estimated \u0026pound350m a year before they were abolished by the EU. But several phone companies have already promised they would not reimpose the charges - including Vodafone and Three. While others would be unlikely to risk losing customers by introducing the fees. Government sources also say there could be UK legislation to stop the charges being imposed.  Earlier this year the Government said that the UK will not be part of the EU\u0027s Digital Single Market but did propose a digital relationship that covers telecommunications and infrastructure. Other areas covered by the documents will include the impact of a no deal scenario on standards relating to the environment and vehicles. The papers will be published after a special meeting of the Cabinet focused on how a no deal outcome could be handled.

Her sister, Simone Cowburn, has slammed the four-part series called \u0027Pistorius\u0027 for also showing images of the blood covered bathroom and hallway, and the gun that was used to kill her.  Shamed Paralympian Oscar Pistorius killed model Reeva, 29, on Valentine\u0027s Day 2013 at their home in Pretoria, South Afrca.  He is serving 13-years in prison for the murder.  Five years after the case, Reeva\u0027s sister Simone Cowburn is angered that documentary makers feel it necessary to show the gristly photos of her sister. In particular, one of her lying dead on the floor has upset her, which  has chosen not to publish.  Speaking to MailOnline , she said: My parents are not young at all. I am worried this will have a terrible effect on them. My father has been really unwell recently and has heart problems.  My question is how did these documentary people get their hands on police photographs of my sister\u0027s body? If his family are involved and trying to get him a reduced sentence, I hope it fails. He needs to stay in prison for a long time for the way he killed my sister.  The documentary\u0027s writer and Producer Sean Richard however argues that the documentary\u0027s purpose was to tell the story as objectively as possible. Included in the four-hour series is a plea from her dad, Barry Steenkamp, to make crime scene photos visible to the public so that the can see the pain that she went through. Directed by Vaughan Sivell, Pistorius looks at the rise and fall of the one-time track hero who shocked the world when he shot his girlfriend four times through a locked toilet door in the night. Throughout his trial, the 31-year Paralympian claimed that he thought that Reeva was an intruder. But the prosecution argued that he killed her during a heated argument. He was at first convicted of culpable homicide, which is the South African equivalent to manslaughter,and sentenced to five years. However the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the conviction and he was found guilty of murder. In 2016 Pistorus was sentenced to six years in jail, which last December was increased to 13-years and four months.  The series shows for the first time that a picture message was sent to the Paralympian\u0027s phone not long before the argument between him and Reeva. While it was originally thought that Pistorius had reacted in a jealous rage to a message on Reeva\u0027s phone the documentary believes that it could have been the other way around. The production crew obtained phone records that show that he received a message at 1.48am on the morning of February 14, 2013. This was ten minutes before neighbours said they heard loud voices from Pistorius\u0027 home. His phone was later sent off by police to be checked and it was discovered to have been connected to a computer owned by Pistorius\u0027 brother, Carl. Journalist Toby Shapshak says in the documentary: When the phone comes back eventually and the information on the phone is accessed it shows that the phone has been plugged into a computer called \u0027titaniumhulk\u0027, which is the Twitter handle of his brother Carl. Now if we look at the data usage of his phone at that time, in the middle of all this there is a very suspicious amount of data and it is at 1.48am in the morning that the duration of the data connection is 309 seconds, which is 5minutes an 15 seconds and it amounts to 58kb. If that was one individual message it would probably be a photograph or a WhatsApp message.

In a hard-hitting, unprecedented speech the Archbishop of \u0026shyCanterbury labelled the online giant “leeches” and slammed its pay for hard-pressed staff which he said needed \u0026shypropping up with benefits. And Mr Welby also ripped into the gig economy, the rise of foodbanks under the Tories and branded Universal Credit a failure. Amazon insisted tonight it paid all the tax “required”. But the Mirror told last month how it declared its lowest UK \u0026shycorporation tax bill in five years. Mr Welby told the TUC Congress in Manchester: “Not paying taxes speaks of the absence of \u0026shycommitment to our shared humanity, to solidarity and justice. If you earn money from a \u0026shycommunity, you should pay your share of tax to that community.  “When vast companies like Amazon, and other online traders, can get away with paying almost nothing in tax, there is something wrong with the tax system. “They don’t pay a real living wage, so the taxpayer must support their workers with benefits. “And having leeched off the taxpayer once they don’t pay for our defence, for security, for stability, for justice, health, equality, education. “Then they complain of an undertrained workforce, from the education they have not paid for, and pay almost nothing for \u0026shyapprenticeships.” Former oil firm executive Mr Welby, who also mocked the demise of payday lenders Wonga, then turned his attention to the poverty raging through Britain.  He demanded the rollout of Universal Credit to be halted, insisting it has left people relying on benefits much worse off. And the 62-year-old said: “The gig economy, zero-hours contracts, is nothing new, it is simply the \u0026shyreincarnation of an ancient evil. “Let us not delude ourselves into thinking the gig economy is the only reincarnation of oppression of the vulnerable in employment. “Pensions are one example of the profit motive leading to the weakest being given the most risk and the strongest the most protection. In these areas, and in \u0026shyemployment rights, and in many others, we see where inequality and injustice seem entrenched it leads to instability in our society, \u0026shydivisions between peoples, and vulnerability to the populism that stirs hatred between ethnicities and religious groups, the rise of ancient demons of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and \u0026shyxenophobia.” On payday loans he added: “Five years ago, I said to the chief executive of Wonga I wanted credit unions to compete him out of business. Well he’s gone. Today I dream that governments put church-run foodbanks out of \u0026shybusiness. I dream of empty night \u0026shyshelters. I dream of debt advice \u0026shycharities without clients.” Mr Welby praised trade unions for their efforts to defend workers’ rights and urged more people, including Church of England priests, to join.  He said: “Great and historic advances were won over this last century and a half by the \u0026shydetermination and vision of working men and women in trade unions.” Mr Welby’s outspoken address, which won a standing ovation, was the first to the TUC since George Carey’s in 1997. GMB General \u0026shySecretary Tim Roache backed his attack on Amazon. He said: “The Archbishop’s speech shows the greed and selfishness of corporate giants who leech off the taxpayer, keep their staff permanently insecure and exercise no level of responsibility to the communities they operate in, is a matter for all of us. “The Archbishop put himself squarely on the side of working people.” New accounts emerged today showing Amazon paid \u0026pound49million tax on its \u0026pound22billion European revenue. That is just 0.02%. But Amazon insisted: “We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate. “Amazon has created more than 25,000 good jobs with good pay and benefits across Britain and we are proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day. “All permanent Amazon fulfilment centre employees are given stock grants, which over the last five years were equal to \u0026pound1,000 or more per year, per person. Employees are offered a comprehensive benefits package.” How they pull it off   By MIKEY SMITH  Political Reporter   Amazon is able to exploit a structure - perfectly legally – to divert sales and profits away from the UK. It means items bought through Amazon’s website are not booked here, but instead through Luxembourg, which has a low-tax regime. Amazon’s UK warehousing and delivery operations are accounted for in the United Kingdom. However, tax deductible share payouts to staff helped slash its corporation tax bill last year. The legal loophole has allowed Amazon to declare its lowest tax bill in five years – paying just \u0026pound4.6million last year as revealed by the Mirror in August.  This means Amazon paid just 6% of its profits of \u0026pound72million. Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, who quit his high-flying Wall Street job to set up the website. By 2013 Amazon had made him a billionaire. Amazon has come a long way since it began as the “world’s largest bookstore” and as well as its delivery service it also streams movies, TV and music via Prime which has 100million subscribers worldwide. Earlier this month it reached a stock market value of 1trillion. Grim working life servicing the machine  By Alan Selby, Sunday Mirror   I worked undercover for five weeks at Amazon’s brand new warehouse in Tilbury, Essex, last year. We exposed the grim reality for workers in the lead-up to Black Friday and Christmas. My colleagues, exhausted by impossible targets, fell asleep on their feet. Campaigners said conditions were like a Victorian workhouse. I struggled to disagree. At every turn it felt like the human staff were reduced to livestock, existing only to service Amazon’s machines. The repetitive, monotonous work turned people into zombies. Anybody who could leave did but many had no option and had to carry on as slaves to the company.  Amazon told us: “Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits. We are proud to have created thousands of permanent roles. Targets are based on previous performance by workers.”   Waves of applause for words of wisdom  TUC Diary   By Paul Routledge   At his 50th Congress  Like the Labour Party, the trade union movement is often described as a broad church. But rarely do the comrades ask the head of the Church of England to deliver a sermon in person. So the appearance of Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, at the Trades Union Congress today was a heaven-sent opportunity for spiritual guidance. He had a difficult act to follow. The Messiah, aka Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who appeared the day before, had promised the earth when Labour gets into power.

Officers from Derbyshire Constabulary were on their way to another job when they came across the two-vehicle crash. They saw the spotted smoke billowing from one of the cars and knew that they had to act quickly. Michael Bradshaw had broken both legs as well as serious fractures to his ribs and arms. One of ankle and foot had also become separated in the head-on collision.  One of the officers told DerbyshireLive , that despite not being able to save his life, they did give him extra time to say goodbye to his family.  PC Pete Robinson said: “We were travelling to another job and went round a corner in the road and were faced with carnage. We think that it happened just a few moments before we arrived. We had to call off what we were going to and deal with this incident.  PC Meek said: “There were two cars involved that had hit head-on, and one car was completely crushed. “Then the crushed car started to smoke. We took our out fire extinguishers and reported the incident. “It took about five minutes for other officers to join us at the scene. “Unfortunately, there was nothing that we could do for the person in the crushed car except keep the flames under control. “But there was a risk that the flames would spread to the other car so we had to take the decision to pull the other driver out of the vehicle.” PC 14193, who didn\u0027t wish to be named, said: “We attended because we are advanced first aiders. We went to the smashed car and we tried to fight the flames but we could not get to him. “So we concentrated on the one in the other car. “He suffered many injuries. He had a separated right angle and foot, and both his legs were broken. “One of his arms had a compound fracture too, and he had some fractured ribs.” "},{"url":null,"title":"former anorexic horrified after branded","story":"NewsFormer anorexic horrified after she was branded a \u0027fat b****\u0027 by weight loss representativeJessica McArthur was told to \u0027enjoy being a fatty for life\u0027 by a Juice Plus representative who messaged her on social mediaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByHannah Smith17:16, 12 SEP 2018Updated17:24, 12 SEP 2018NewsJessica McArthur was not impressed by the message \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who had previously battled with anorexia was horrified when a representative for a slimming brand called her a fat b****. Jessica McArthur, 23, received a message on social media from a person claiming to work for Juice Plus who criticised her \u0027mum tum\u0027. The message asked: I\u0027m guessing you want to lose the mum tum you\u0027ve got? Jessica, who had already worked on her post-baby figure, replied with a photo of her abs. But the response didn\u0027t go down well with the rep, who branded her a \u0027fat b****\u0027 and said that she should have tried the scheme so she didn\u0027t look like a \u0027fat c***\u0027. To add further insult, the person signed the abusive message off with: Enjoy being a fatty for life babes.  Professional singer Jessica, who previously battled anorexia, is speaking out as she believes companies targeting mums at their most \u0027vulnerable\u0027 time could be putting their health at risk. Juice Plus have now apologised to Jessica about the contents of the messages from an \u0027independent representative\u0027 or \u0027franchise partner\u0027 and continue to investigate the incident. Jessica, from Sleaford, East Midlands, said: I was shocked. It makes me wonder if Juice Plus reps are targeting people who they know will be insecure and vulnerable. When you\u0027re a new mum, your body has already changed quite a bit anyway. It\u0027s hard to think how badly affected some women could be by this. She called me fat. I\u0027ve worked hard to get my body back after giving birth and I\u0027m proud of it. How many people have spent money that they should be spending on their baby on this? They may think they\u0027re helping people lose weight healthily but it could very easily go the opposite way. I don\u0027t think its very ethical if reps are targeting news mum specifically.  In the messages, the initially polite woman insists she \u0027wasn\u0027t trying to cause offence\u0027 and thought Jessica would \u0027want to get rid of the belly\u0027. Jessica said: The rep got in touch and sent a message saying I might want to get rid of my mum tum.  She must have been on my Facebook to ascertain I was a parent then targeted me.  It\u0027s a bit weird - it was like she was specifically seeking out new mums by her message. My boyfriend Aidan was here when the message came through and I read it out in the kitchen. He actually said the exact same as I was thinking, calling her a \u0027cheeky b****\u0027. Someone else in my area had received the same message from her and they also had a baby. I\u0027d never spoken to her in my life and she just popped up in my message requests telling me I needed her product.  She carried on and I tried to tell her I didn\u0027t want it then I sent back a photo of me. I\u0027m proud of body because it brought my daughter into the world. It immediately turned into a tirade of swearing and abuse from her then.  As a teenager Jessica battled anorexia but has now recovered and claims she is happy with her body. She fears that targeting individuals when they may already be insecure could cause them to become ill. After reporting the incident to Juice Plus, she was reportedly told the incident would be investigated and the company \u0027don\u0027t ask reps to behave like that towards customers.\u0027 Jess said: I had anorexia as a teenager and I would have spent so much money on those products in a desperate attempt to lose more weight. They could have made me worse. The woman has since deactivated her Facebook.  Juice Plus claim they \u0027sincerely apologise\u0027 to Jessica after she received the offensive comments from someone claiming to be one of their \u0027Franchise Partners\u0027. They have launched an investigation into the identity of the individual, but claim they can find no record of her on their database. Their investigation continues. A spokesperson for The Juice Plus+ Company said: The Juice Plus+ Company would like to sincerely apologise to Jessica and to anyone else who felt understandably upset by the content contained in the message from the independent representative. Here in Juice Plus+ we strongly condemn any similar message and we do not accept at all this kind of behaviour.

Prior to her divorce to Charles in August 1996, but during their separation, Diana took a string of lovers as she broke away from the royal family. Yesterday it was revealed one of those lovers, Oliver Hoare, had died from cancer aged 73. It\u0027s thought married Oliver, a father-of-three, began an affair with Diana in 1992. He was 16 years older than the princess, and the affair ended when his wife threatened him with divorce. Oliver, a close friend of Charles, was said to have been hounded by 300 malicious calls from Princess Diana after he ended the affair. Other lovers Diana took included protection officer Barry Mannakee, rugby legend Will Carling and cavalry officer James Hewitt.  The married close protection officer was a police officer with the Royal protection Squad and bodyguard to Diana. He was eventually transferred from his role as her protection officer following what was described as an inappropriate relationship between the two. In tapes recorded by Diana\u0027s voice coach, she admitted that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. While not referring to him by name, it\u0027s believed she was speaking about Mannakee. She told friends: He was my father figure and looked after me. Mannakee, 37, died in a motorbike accident in 1987. James Gilby   Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s secret plan to leave their husbands and escape royal life  Diana\u0027s friend James Gilby Affectionately gave Diana the nickname of Squidgy. He was caught speaking to her on the Squidgygate phone tapes secretly recorded in 1989. He knew the princess since before her marriage to Charles and the recorded tapes caused huge controversy around how they were obtained. It\u0027s thought Diana\u0027s relationship with James was at its peak in 1989. Will Carling   Clever trick Meghan Markle uses to make sure she doesn\u0027t up-stage Prince Harry  Diana and rugby legend Will Carling met at a Chelsea gym. After an affair, Diana fell out with the sportsman when their relationship was revealed in 1995. Carling, who played for England, was married at the time of the affair with the princess. His wife criticised Diana\u0027s conduct during the fallout, while the princess said he had followed her like a puppy. Hasnat Khan   Princess Diana used clever trick at the gym to try and stop photographers taking her picture  Heart surgeon Hasnat Khan had a two-year relationship with Diana, starting in 1995. She is said to have described him as Mr Wonderful and the pair even considered marriage. Diana is thought to have seen Khan as the love of her life and even visited his family in Lahore, Pakistan. The cardiologist has never sought to cash in on their relationship after her death and has never revealed intimate details of their time together. Diana is thought to have ended the relationship in June 1997.

The Association of Educational Psychologists tabled a motion at the TUC Congress calling for smacking to be outlawed. At present, parents are allowed to smack or physically chastise a child as long as it is deemed “reasonable”. But campaigners hope smacking will soon be a criminal offence. The Scottish Parliament is making moves to ban physical chastisement of children and England could follow. But is a ban on smacking a step too far?   YES   Says Dr Stuart Waiton   Senior lecturer in sociology and criminology at Abertay University  The arguments by the anti-smackers are so confused and convoluted they increasingly sound like irrational, distrusting zealots rather than the caring experts they like to think of themselves as. In Scotland, the law proposed by John Finnie will make a light smack on the back of a child’s hand a criminal offence. We don’t plan on criminalising loving parents who give a light tap on the hand, Finnie says, as he criminalises hand-tapping loving parents. He goes on to say that smacking children is the same as domestic violence. But if he believes this then surely we should criminalise parents, arrest them, drag them down to the station and throw the book at them. So-called experts tell us, “research shows” that any smack is harmful to a child’s mental health. And yet, other research, by Robert Larzelere, a professor in human development and family science, for example, shows that this is nonsense. But we don’t need “experts” to know that a smack on a child’s hand is not going to “scar them for life”. It simply makes no sense. It makes no sense because the anti-smacking crusade is not predicated upon genuine research. It is based on a new type of exaggerated belief, adopted by the professional and political class, that children are incredibly fragile, especially emotionally fragile, to the extent that almost any difficult experience is reinterpreted as abusive and damaging. This is why the NSPCC has equated shouting at a child with emotional abuse. Maybe we should criminalise shouting as well! This outlook is predicated upon a profound mistrust of parents and families, which has more to do with the disconnect between “experts” and ordinary people than anything to do with the abusive nature of the vast majority of loving parents.  This ideology is based on a wrong-headed belief that ordinary parents simply cannot cope without the skills and expertise of parenting professionals. Without them, they believe, parents will harm their children. And yet a starting point for good parenting must be a recognition that there is a profound difference between an adult and a child. A smack is not the same as domestic violence. For millions of people it is part and parcel of being a loving parent. By suggesting otherwise we only confuse parents, undermine their authority and do a serious disservice to children.   Dr Stuart Waiton is a member of the campaign group Be Reasonable.     NO   Says LIAT HUGHES JOSHI   Parenting Author  It is staggering that smacking hasn’t been banned in the whole of the United Kingdom yet. If you smack an adult because you are annoyed at them and you are trying to change their behaviour, that is a criminal offence. Therefore, I don’t really see why it is still OK to smack a child. Sometimes when parents smack it is because they have lost control. When you do that it sets a bad example to your child. It says to them it is OK to smack someone if you feel annoyed. And for a child, who is obviously much smaller than the parent, it is quite a frightening experience to be smacked. I was smacked as a child and remember feeling scared. Then, when I was about six or seven, I had a phase where I went around hitting other children because I just thought that’s what you did. Children learn from adults. If their mum or dad is smacking them they don’t always copy, but don’t complain if they start smacking you back or start hitting other kids in the playground, because that is what they’re seeing. Not smacking them does not mean we should not have firm boundaries. I am a big believer in authoritative parents showing their child they mean what they say and that they are in charge.

Jo Xie and Tommy Yuen had bought an old skate shop to transform into a tea shop and had decided to give the shutters a lick of fresh paint. The decorators were half-way through covering the graffiti when a man came running over with tears in his eyes.  Mr Hamada, who was hired to fit out the new tea shop told BristolLive : “I came back saw a guy was standing there – he was really upset, like he was crying a bit.  He said: “I came up to him and I said ‘what’s up? Did I do something wrong?’ “He told me it was by a famous artist, so I stopped everything and told the landlord.”  At this point the bottom half of the mural, created without the use of his iconic stencils, had been erased. The piece is thought to date back to the late 80s and early 90s. Tommy, who had no idea that he\u0027d purchased work by a world-famous artist along with the shop, said: “We didn’t know. As soon as we found out we thought ‘Oh no! We’d better keep it.’ I actually didn’t believe it at first. I’ve lived in Bristol my whole life and I didn’t know this was a Banksy,” he said.  Banksy enthusiast Simon Whiteway posted a picture of the half-painted over mural on his Facebook saying: “One of Banksy\u0027s original freehand murals on a shutter, circa 1999. Now getting painted over today.”  Alongside was a picture of the store from 2014 back when it was the Rollermania skate shop, with owners Tony and Louise Coffey outside. “Tony told me Banksy used to come in and offer him original artwork in exchange for a few Stussy t-shirts, Tony refused,” Simon wrote. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast hurricane helene","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Hurricane Helene on course for Britain as Atlantic storm U-turns away from USHurricane Helene is currently in the Atlantic Ocean, following the trail of Florence, which is about to make landfall on the east coast of AmericaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNatalie Evans03:00, 13 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/hurricane-helene-looks-huge-spaceand-13236111,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hurricane swirling off the coast of the United States could be on a collision course for Britain. Hurricane Helene is currently in the Atlantic Ocean, following the trail of Florence, which is about to make landfall on the east coast of America. Officials in the Carolinas urged people to evacuate the coast ahead of the storm\u0027s expected pounding winds and rain-driven floods. Florence weakened slightly to a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale but had maximum sustained winds of 125 miles per hour  as of 2pm EDT , down from 130mph earlier in the day. According to the latest trajectory, the centre will most likely strike the southern coast of North Carolina by late Thursday or early Friday, the National Hurricane Center  said.  Isaac, a smaller hurricane, is headed for the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to grow stronger over the next day or two, according to forecasters. But Helene looks set to U-turn at the end of the week, swirling northeast towards the UK. Helene is forecast to gradually weaken over the next couple of days and may become a tropical storm on Thursday, according to the NHC. Helene was located about 1,285 miles south-southwest of the Azores in the Atlantic with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Wednesday.  Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: “There is a chance Helene will be caught up in the jet stream and that would bring some wet and windy weather to the UK after the weekend. “However this will depend on the conditions around the UK at the time of arrival, it could end up strengthening high pressure emphasising drier conditions.”  But the hurricane\u0027s approach to Britain might not be bad news, as the remnants could heat up the already warm conditions expected next week. Smith added: “There is a chance the southeast could turn very warm next week and this could be another effect of the remnants of Helene. “Already we expect temperatures in the region to be higher than average for the time of year due to the direction of airflow bringing warmer air in from the Atlantic. “Air associated with Helene could end up being caught up with this bringing even warmer conditions.”   Meanwhile, the national forecaster yesterday revealed its list of storm names for 2018 to 2019 .  The next severe weather will be named Storm Ali to reflect our “diversity”. This is the fourth year the government weather services of Britain and Ireland have combined to name disruptive systems. But this is the first time \u0026shyofficials have added names to improve race relations. A Met Office spokesman said: “This season’s names have been compiled from a list submitted by the public... selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and diversity.” The list of 21 includes Storm Idris which may be a nod to actor Idris Elba.

The small aircraft was captured dipping in and out of dense clouds before emerging in the centre of the storm that has forced more than one million people to evacuate their homes. The time-lapse footage showed the plane surrounded by a ring of the gray clouds, then breaking through into a still centre with bright blue skies.  Nick Underwood, the government \u0027hurricane hunter\u0027 took to Twitter to share the incredible footage with the caption: This is probably the coolest thing I\u0027ve filmed.  His mission was gruelling, each hurricane-investigating flight typically takes around 8-12 hours and to reach the storm\u0027s eye the aircraft must first break through heavy rain and winds. The researchers on board drop cylindrical GPS instruments called dropwindsondes, which drift through the hurricane in the plane\u0027s wake.  As they fall they transmit critical readings on wind speed, direction, air pressure, temperature and humidity. This helps scientists predict the storms characteristics and next moves - which in turn improves preparation for future storms. One Twitter user commented on the stunning video, calling it \u0027beautiful and terrifying.\u0027 Hurricane Florence is this year\u0027s most powerful storm and has been rated Category 4 with winds of 130mph. It has been expected to strike the southern coast North Carolina by Thursday or early Friday, the National Hurricane Center  said.   National Weather Service told CNN : This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that\u0027s saying a lot given the impacts we\u0027ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew,  Not everyone is running from the extreme weather, Brad Corpening, 35, plans on riding out the storm in his boarded up delicatessen in Wilmington. He said: I\u0027m not approaching Florence from fear or panic. It\u0027s going to happen. We just need to figure out how to make it through.    Updated NHC forecasts showed the storm lingering near the coast, bringing days of heavy rains that could bring intense inland flooding from South Carolina to Virginia. Parts of North Carolina could get up to a metre of rain fall. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper predicted that tens of thousands of homes and businesses would be flooded in his state.  The time to prepare is almost over, Cooper warned.U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter warned of the storm\u0027s dangers and praised his administration\u0027s handling of past hurricanes, rejecting criticism for its response to Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico.

Parts of North Carolina could get 40 inches  of rain. Jeff Byard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  warned residents the storm would bring a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast. Heed the warnings, Byard said.  Wednesday Florence is approximately 435 miles southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina and roughly 470 miles east-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, as of 2 p.m. ET, according to the NHC. The hurricane is currently moving northwest at 16mph with winds of 125 mph. It\u0027s believed the storm could strengthen overnight as it draws energy from warm water in the Atlantic. The wind speed could increase to Category 5 strength, which means winds of 157 mph  or higher. Forecasters also said the dangerous storm was generating 83-foot waves. The NHC\u0027s morning briefing said the hurricane is moving between Bermuda and the Bahamas today and should reach the US coast within 36 hours. “This is a life-threatening situation. Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property.”   Thursday 8am  The storm will have winds of 145mph by tomorrow morning local time.  Thursday 8pm  By the evening, it\u0027s believed the wind strength will have reduced to around 140mph. Florence is expected to remain off the coast for the next few days, churning the coast with storm surge, high winds and flooding rainfall.  Friday 8am By Friday morning, the storm\u0027s wind speed will be 120mph as the hurricane remains off the North Carolina coast. The storm, which is expected to be Category 3 by this time, will then start to drift left down the coast. It\u0027s unclear when or if it will make landfall. Some reports suggest it will remain in the ocean gathering strength by this stage.    Friday 11pm It\u0027s believed the storm will hover off the coast before making landfall. It\u0027s unusual for a hurricane to linger along a coastline and this could bring dire results as parts of the Carolinas could endure hurricane conditions for 24 hours. This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that\u0027s saying a lot given the impacts we\u0027ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew, the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina said. The service also stressed the potential for “unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm.   Saturday 8am As it approaches the coast, it\u0027s estimated the wind speed will have reduced to around 100mph. Florence is forecast to approach the South Carolina coast Saturday morning at 8 a.m. The storm could be reduced to a category 2 storm by the time it reaches land but this could result in an increase in rainfall to 40 inches in North Carolina. Florence is forecast to meander inland, slowly into South Carolina and could spend the weekend battering the Carolinas.

Joshua Horner, a plumber from Redmond, Oregon, had been handed the lengthy jail term after he was convicted of sexually abusing a young girl. Horner was put behind bars after a jury found him guilty of sexual abuse of a minor on April 12, 2017. Six months after his conviction, Horner contacted the Oregon Innocence Project - a voluntary organisation dedicated to investigating miscarriages of justice - in a desperate bid to clear his name.  During the case the complainant claimed Horner had threatened to hurt her pets if she went forward to authorities. The girl says Horner then shot the black Labrador to make his point more forcefully, an allegation that he strenuously denied. Volunteers at the Oregon Innocence Project tried to find the distinctive black Labrador cross-breed and employed the help of Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel who agreed to assist with enquiries.  The team then worked off a tip that alleged Lucy had been given away and began scouring the state for further clues. “They made a couple [of] trips around Deschutes County [and] he was not there,” Oregon Innocence Project legal director Steve Wax said. “We heard he was in Seattle. Then we learned he had a place on the Oregon Coast.” Lucy the dog was later found on the porch of a home in Gearhart, some 80 miles northwest of Portland. “She’s not purebred,” Christon said. “She’s got this adorable-shaped head and really long ears.  She was drinking a bowl of water and sitting in shade underneath a porch. We played with her. Petted her. It was wonderful.” Using the new evidence, Horner\u0027s case and subsequent conviction was overturned by Deschutes County Judge Michael Adler.   First ever double heart bypass surgery performed on dog - at a cost of \u0026pound12,000  OIP’s Legal Director, Steve Wax, says, “this case is a prime example of a cooperative search for truth and justice when the validity of a conviction is called into question.” Getting an innocent man out of prison takes an incredible amount of effort and that is all worthwhile when you see him walking free”, he added. Mr Horner thanked the work of the Oregon Innocence Project to clear his name - marking the first time the organisation has overturned an unjust conviction.

Shervin Dorostkar, 31, allegedly slipped the Spanish Goldfly sex drops into the woman\u0027s mocktail at the exclusive celebrity haunt, the Kensington Roof Gardens so they could have sex. Dorostkar told a jury he was so drunk he mixed up the drinks at the club on 14 May 2016. He had picked her up at about 11.30pm and she was under the impression that they would be meeting some friends but they never arrived. One of the barmen at the club spotted Dorostkar making strange movements under the bar and sounded the alert, Southwark Crown Court heard. The pair were separated and the police were called.  Giving evidence Dorostkar said: I wanted to put this sachet [of Spanish Goldfly] in my own drink to go to dance. I didn\u0027t know which one was mine and which one hers, I was drunk. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith asked: Are you telling us now you made a mistake and put it in the wrong drink? He replied: Absolutely yes, I made a mistake. Mr Daniells-Smith: After sipping, twice, from the strawberry cocktail you made a mistake? The Iranian tearfully replied: Yeah because I was thinking it was my own drink.  The prosecutor asked: Do you accept, now you have seen video, that you put the sachet of liquid into [the victim\u0027s] drink? Dorostkar replied: I believe that now, yes. Veronica Ramsden, defending, said: You are stopped by security and you send a couple of messages to [the victim]. She explained that the messages, sent in his mother tongue of Farsi, were instructions for the victim, telling her to tell police that she knew about sex drops. I was panicked, he explained. It was the first time happening in my life, somebody stopping me and asking me questions. They told me, the staff, if she\u0027s your girlfriend you go home and nothing will happen. When the woman asked him over text what the concoction was for, he replied: It\u0027s only for sex. Why are you talking about sex at all? asked Ms Ramsden. Dorostkar replied: She asked me what it is, I panicked. I said its nothing dangerous or harmful, it\u0027s just for sex. The prosecutor also read from the police statement taken from Dorostkar the morning after his arrest. He told police: I open the sachet and I put it in my drink and I drank a little bit.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/BrewDog-2-e1496670653794.jpg ","title":"brewdog to hand out free beer in dundee today but you need to be prepared","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBrewDog has announced an international ‘Bad Beer Amnesty’ giving drinkers the opportunity to swap any mainstream lager for a pint of its new headliner beer, Lost Lager, which hits its bars today. 100vw, 3500px\" /BrewDog in Dundee\u0026#8217s Panmure Street will have a designated ‘Bad Beer Bin’ where visitors can dump their unwanted cans of beer in exchange for a pint of BrewDog.They will be accepting cans from midday to closing time on 12th September 2018 in all participating bars.Each person who swaps a can of ‘bad beer’ will be entitled to one free pint of Lost Lager.The initiative to get drinkers to upgrade their lagers will be available in all BrewDog’s UK bars, as well as its Barcelona, Berlin and Brussels bars in mainland Europe.The move is to celebrate Lost Lager being stocked by Tesco and Booker nationwide from today, in 330ml bottles, 330ml cans, and 660ml bottles.BrewDog cofounder James Watt said: “Lost Lager is our best lager to date a crisp, clean pilsner with hints of spice and a zesty lime marmalade character.\u0026#8220To mark its launch, we wanted to give beer drinkers a chance to taste a lager made with soul and passion, rather than the mass-produced fizzy yellow swill that the big breweries have been peddling for years.\u0026#8220So, bin your Budweiser, say farewell to Fosters, and get your hands on a pint of Lost Lager.” “For decades, the craft of lager has been lost and forgotten, bastardised by mega breweries putting profit before flavour.\u0026#8220But brewed right, lager can pack huge flavour and offer a really exciting style with depth and character.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/Gerry-Cinnamon-4-940x529.jpg ","title":"cult hero gerry cinnamon announces dundee gig","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish music sensation Gerry Cinnamon has announced a Dundee show for this winter.The Glasgow singer-songwriter will take to the Caird Hall stage on Thursday December 13.The 32-year-old has played in the city twice already this year with each gig at Fat Sam\u0026#8217s selling out in minutes.Cinnamon will perform another gig in Dundee which will be sure to delight eager fans.Gerry’s music covers a number of themes, but one constant is his honest and often humorous appraisal of his past growing up in Castlemilk, and his times spent in ious jobs, chasing girls and drinking with friends.

I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b963815b248d-769x564.jpg ","title":"return of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil

it – we need people to get on board for that.”Xplore has secured the loan of a £220,000 demonstrator bus from Northern Irish firm Wrightbus for the three-month trial.Tourists boarding the bus – which has eye-catching electric green livery featuring graphics of city landmarks – can pick up a brochure showing them the full route, as well as links to other services to places further afield, such as Broughty Ferry.The all-electric bus can operate all day without having to be charged, running from 8am-5.30pm at a fixed price of £3 for adults and £2 for children.Should the trial be considered a success, Xplore hopes to either extend its lease of the bus or find money to buy one of its own.Christine added: “The fact is there is a need for this service.“If it is successful, then brilliant – but if need be, we will look into subsidies such as low emission grants and tourism grants to keep it going.“It will all depend on how people use it.“We’re looking into things such as a recording played over the speakers telling people about their next stops, and tying it into tickets like Plusbus, which you can buy when you buy a train ticket to Dundee.“It’s trying to cater for all – local people to give them the connectivity, and people coming in to discover the city.”The Tele joined the 360’s inaugural run around the 2.65-mile route, taking in the Waterfront, Overgate, Verdant Works, McManus and Foxlake.The eco-friendly bus – which can recapture energy lost during braking to keep the battery charged – is zero-emission, apart from a tiny diesel generator used to heat the interior.Among the passengers on the City Circle’s first run were city council development chief Mike Galloway, North East Labour MSP Jenny Marra and local B\u0026ampB owners Barrie and Olwyn Jack. Mr Galloway said: “With the Waterfront coming to fruition and becoming a reality, a service linking everything together is another piece in the puzzle.“I hope it is really successful and does well.”Ms Marra said: “I think it’s great – the more public transport in Dundee the better it is for getting around.“It’s also really important that they’re using an economical bus. It’s great for the environment and I would like to see even more environmentally-friendly buses in the area.”Barrie and Olwyn, who run Duntrune House north of the city, say they think the 360 is a “great idea”.Olwyn added: “It’s excellent for people who come into Dundee that don’t have their bearings, linking everything up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s

contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notifications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notifications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specifying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item if they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her life now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a divorced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no life, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my life was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horrific surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year. Just turn up at the door at 6.30pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsFacebookSocial mediaCharityPrestwick"},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated09:50, 12 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal. A museum in the Town Hall and a drive to convert empty shop units for housing have also been put forward. It is all part of South Ayrshire Council’s answer to save the ailing High Street and politicians are launching a consultation to get feedback. Revealing the masterplan, council leader Douglas Campbell said: “The Citadel is coming to the end of its useful life. We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the

committee.\n\u0026ldquoWe have worked very closely and collaboratively with a wide range of stakeholders over the past few years to develop this project and we believe very strongly that it complied

available electricity grid connection, proven turbine delivery route and is relatively isolated.\n\u0026ldquoIt is also located in an area identified in the council\u0026rsquos finalised renewable energy supplementary guidance, dated March 2018, as having the highest capacity for wind turbine development.\n\u0026ldquoWe were especially disappointed with the decision, given that the application was presented at the planning committee with no objections from any of the statutory consultees and was recommended for approval by the council\u0026rsquos own chief planning officer.\n\u0026ldquoWe

B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either

motorists to stop off in the Royal Burgh.\nAnd the town\u0026rsquos Business Improvement District  officers are currently probing the ious options.\nLocal councillor Caroline Penman said: \u0026ldquoAlong with Selkirk BIDs we are looking at what the new signs should say to encourage people to stop and explore \u0026ndash should it be the Old Town Centre, William Wallace or Sir Walter Scott?\n\u0026ldquoThe signs would pinpoint people towards attractions and also where to park.\nSir Walter Scott dispensed justice from the bench in Selkirk for almost 30 years.\nAnd, as well as a town centre statue to celebrate the connection, his courtroom has been transformed into a museum to the world-famous author and poet.\nBut William Wallace\u0026rsquos connections to the town are every bit as strong.\nIt is widely believed that he was declared  of Scotland at a medieval kirk just a short walk from the town centre at the height of his Braveheart battles with England.\nA geophysics

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnificently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other significant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"price-tag-of-up-to-1449-for-iphone-xs-max-defended-by-experts","story":"Apple\u0026rsquos pricing of its new iPhone XS Max has been defended despite plans to charge up to \u0026pound1,449 for some models of the new device.\nThe technology giant announced three new smartphones \u0026ndash the iPhone XS, XS Max and iPhone XR \u0026ndash at its latest live event in California, promising fans that the new products are the \u0026ldquomost advanced the company has ever made.\nThe XS Max features the largest screen and battery that Apple has ever used for an iPhone, a landmark reflected by a \u0026pound1,099 starting price, which rises to \u0026pound1,449 for the 512GB storage version.\n\"\nRu Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch, said although these were steep prices, such figures were common for modern smartphones, and there was enough choice to satisfy all budgets.\n\u0026ldquoThe Max is clearly a serious piece of tech and its starting price reflects that, he said.\n\u0026ldquoThis might be at the very top end of what Apple has charged customers before, but the tiered pricing strategy across the three handsets means that iPhone enthusiasts and newcomers alike can find a device that suits their needs among this latest generation of smartphones.\nAlongside the flagship XS Max and smaller XS, Apple also announced the iPhone XR.\nIntroducing the device, marketing head Phil Schiller said the firm wanted to \u0026ldquoreach as many people as possible.\nThe XR features many of the same specifications as the XS duo but has only a single rear camera, an LCD screen \u0026ndash unlike the XS\u0026rsquo OLED \u0026ndash and starts at \u0026pound749 when it goes on sale in October.\nBen Wood, chief of research at analyst firm CCS Insight, said Apple\u0026rsquos popularity would offset the price for many.\n\u0026ldquoThe iPhone XS Max once again takes Apple into new territory when it comes to price, he said.\n\u0026ldquoAt 1,099 dollars it\u0026rsquos the most expensive iPhone to date, but I have little doubt that it\u0026rsquoll be a huge success. It underlines what a powerful franchise Apple has created and that the public\u0026rsquos love affair with the iPhone is stronger than ever.\n\"\n\u0026ldquoHistory tells us that every time Apple introduces a new larger-screen iPhone, it prompts a surge in upgrades by existing owners.

formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two

zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to

In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

Avoid touching the animal and always make sure to wash your hands if any contact is made dead marine animals, like any other animal, can carry disease or infection.\u0026#8216This is obviously really unusual and something we, along with many of our colleagues, are working to investigate.  All of these carcases stranding in Scotland were in advanced state of autolysis and had been at sea for many days. Consequently, it has not been possible to derive much pathological information from these cases, which is a pain, as this is information we need to identify possible causes of death.\u0026#8216Cuvier’s beaked whales  are native to both British and Irish waters where they occur in deep waters, typically greater than 50 km offshore. It is well documented that Cuvier’s beaked whales are one of the most sensitive species to acoustic disturbance.\u0026#8216Beaked whales, like many cetaceans, ‘see’ the world through sound, so excessive underwater noise can have potentially disastrous effects on their physiology and behaviour. Loud noise can damage the sensitive hair cells in the ear, rendering the animal functionally deaf, or cause gas bubbles to form in the tissues leading to the equivalent of the bends.\u0026#8216Unfortunately, many of the pathological indicators left by excessive exposure to underwater noise are rapidly lost after death, so in most of these cases we won’t have much to go on based on examination of the carcases alone.\u0026#8216The more cases we find, the more chance we have of being able to triangulate a possible origin for these deaths.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown loyal hands out 2000","story":"One half of the money, all raised by the club\u0026#8217s annual charity match on Saturday August 25, will pay for new soft furnishings in the Sunroom, a palliative care suite at the hospital, to create a more home environment for patients.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-flats-at-former-musselburgh-tesco-set-to-start-in-spring","story":"  Plans were approved by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee nearly a year ago.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Officials said the changes involved positioning of new properties and parking but did not alter the number of homes planned for the land.  The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events. But it was granted with several conditions, including that the club must tell police about any 18th or 21st birthday parties being held in the Recreation Park clubhouse at least two weeks in advance.  They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not just a rugby club any longer \u0026ndash it has several different aspects to it as a community hub.  \u0026ldquoI do not see a problem in relation to the licence.  Iain Dove, NBRFC president, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased with the news that the licensing board have approved our application for a full licence, along with an identified area to the front of the club that can be used for drinks in good weather.  \u0026ldquoThis will be a fenced area, secure for children, and we hope it will prove to be popular with families. We hope to continue to grow the use of our facilities by the North Berwick community.  At the meeting, Mr Fruzynski criticised the club for not sending anyone to attend the hearing, at Haddington Town House last Thursday.  Highlighting that they were not the only applicants to fail to attend the hearing that day, he said: \u0026ldquoIt is disappointing so many applicants have not turned up to answer questions of the board because they are all advised that someone should be available to attend.  Mr Dove apologised to the licensing board, via the Courier, and added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that we have changed our licence and we simply didn\u0026rsquot know that it was possible to attend.  Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of the High Street in late-2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes, and a Post Office - as well as refurbishing The Fraser Centre.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s life that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

The XS Max features the largest screen and battery that Apple has ever used for an iPhone, a landmark reflected by a \u0026pound1,099 starting price, which rises to \u0026pound1,449 for the 512GB storage version.  Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch, said although these were steep prices, such figures were common for modern smartphones, and there was enough choice to satisfy all budgets.  \u0026ldquoThe Max is clearly a serious piece of tech and its starting price reflects that, he said.  \u0026ldquoThis might be at the very top end of what Apple has charged customers before, but the tiered pricing strategy across the three handsets means that iPhone enthusiasts and newcomers alike can find a device that suits their needs among this latest generation of smartphones.  Alongside the flagship XS Max and smaller XS, Apple also announced the iPhone XR.  Introducing the device, marketing head Phil Schiller said the firm wanted to \u0026ldquoreach as many people as possible.  The XR features many of the same specifications as the XS duo but has only a single rear camera, an LCD screen \u0026ndash unlike the XS\u0026rsquo OLED \u0026ndash and starts at \u0026pound749 when it goes on sale in October.  Ben Wood, chief of research at analyst firm CCS Insight, said Apple\u0026rsquos popularity would offset the price for many.  \u0026ldquoThe iPhone XS Max once again takes Apple into new territory when it comes to price, he said.  \u0026ldquoAt 1,099 dollars it\u0026rsquos the most expensive iPhone to date, but I have little doubt that it\u0026rsquoll be a huge success. It underlines what a powerful franchise Apple has created and that the public\u0026rsquos love affair with the iPhone is stronger than ever.  \u0026ldquoHistory tells us that every time Apple introduces a new larger-screen iPhone, it prompts a surge in upgrades by existing owners. We expect the iPhone XS Max to have exactly the same effect despite its price tag.  Apple introduced its first \u0026pound1,000 smartphone \u0026ndash the iPhone X \u0026ndash last year, and despite a slight drop in sales, the company has reported increased revenue and profit during 2018.  Elsewhere at its event in California, Apple introduced the fourth generation of its Apple Watch, with even greater focus on health and wellbeing.  The new Apple Watch Series 4 features sensors that can detect when wearers suffer a heavy fall as well as alert them if it clocks abnormal heart rates."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8676638.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"victoria-beckham-and-burberry-set-to-be-highlights-of-london-fashion-week","story":"  An audience of thousands made up of buyers, media, designers and models from 50 countries and all five continents are descending on the capital for five days of catwalk shows and presentations beginning on Friday.

Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my wife screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"sfa-agree-to-buy-hampden-park-from-queens-park-for-5m-after-current-lease-expires-in-2020","story":"  The governing body has agreed to buy the stadium from current owners Queen\u0026rsquos Park for \u0026pound5 million when the existing lease of Hampden expires in summer 2020.  The decision follows a lengthy process that saw Hampden Park competing with BT Murrayfield to be the home of Scottish football following the Euro 2020 finals.  The Scottish FA will now work with Queen\u0026rsquos Park to complete the agreement, which will see the ownership of Hampden Park transfer to the Scottish FA for a cash price of \u0026pound5 million.  Queen\u0026rsquos Park will adapt Lesser Hampden to become its new registered licensed ground for all its matches.  Ownership of Hampden Park will enable the SFA to control the future of the stadium.  It will open up opportunities to continue to develop the infrastructure and create a national stadium that will inspire the next generation of football fans.  The SFA expressed their gratitude to Lord Willie Haughey, who has pledged half of the total cash commitment .  SFA president Alan McRae said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement has been the conclusion of a four-year process to review our national stadium beyond 2020.  \u0026ldquoIt was a hugely difficult decision and I would like to place on record our thanks to Scottish Rugby for their professionalism throughout the process.  \u0026ldquoThey made a truly compelling case to move to Edinburgh and gave us a very difficult decision to make.

It is about the future of football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoI would also like to thank everyone who has been part of this process and to recognise the enormous generosity of Lord Haughey.  \u0026ldquoFinally, it has also been a hugely challenging time for Queen\u0026rsquos Park, Hampden Park Limited and all of the people who will be directly affected by this decision. We appreciate all their efforts to reach an agreement today and look forward to working with them to shape the future and continue to develop a national stadium that we can all be proud of.  SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: \u0026ldquoI would first of all like to offer my thanks to Dominic McKay and his team at Scottish Rugby. They have been impressive throughout the process and I would like to continue to build that relationship. There is a lot we can learn from each other.  \u0026ldquoToday is a big day for Scottish football. Hampden Park has been the spiritual home of Scottish football for over 100 years it has been central to our sport\u0026rsquos identity in this country. But today\u0026rsquos decision is about the future, not the past.  \u0026ldquoOur mission is to inspire a nation to love the game and having a home that we can call our own is an important part of that. It will enable us to drive investment into the game and give us the best chance to improve football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile we are now committed to Hampden Park we also recognise that it needs to change. We have heard the fans\u0026rsquo views throughout the process and agree with them that we need to improve access, transport links and the overall experience. We are committed to doing that.  \u0026ldquoWith all the commitments that have been made to the Scottish FA and Hampden Park Limited throughout this process, taking ownership of the Hampden Park site will create the potential to transform the home of Scottish football for the benefit of Scottish football fans. Ownership really will change the game. We look forward to working with all interested parties to achieve an exciting and fan-friendly vision for Hampden Park.  \u0026ldquoWith that in mind, we need all of Scotland to pull together to make it Scotland\u0026rsquos national stadium.

Read more: Births to mothers over 45 growing faster in Scotland than anywhere else in UK\u0026nbsp  While the Royal College of Midwives  stressed that the staffing situation is \"much better\"compared to England and welcomed the Scottish Government\u0027s investment in training new midwives, it flagged concerns over shortages in the north of Scotland and the threat posed by a sudden exodus of midwives to retirement with 40% of the workforce north of the Border\u0026nbspnow aged over 50. This compares to 32% in England.  The \u0027State of Maternity Services\u0027 report found that 51% of pregnant women in Scotland in 2017 were obese or overweight, the first time the proportion has exceeded 50%.  This puts them at greater risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature birth.  Meanwhile, a total of 158 babies were born to women aged over 45 last year - the highest number to date, and up from 29 in 2000. The number of births to women aged 40 to 44 has increased 68% over the same period.  On average, older mother require more care and support during pregnancy and birth as they are more likely to have complex medical conditions or be giving birth to twins and triplets on account of IVF.  Read more: Risk of heart attacks and strokes increases the more children a woman has\u0026nbsp  The report states that these demographic trends have contributed to an increased workload for midwives despite falling birth rates.  At the same time, the vacancy rate for midwives has increased from 1.3% in September 2013 to 5% in March 2018 - equivalent to 127 empty posts.  Recruitment problems are toughest in Grampian, Highland and the Western Isles.  Looming retirements were also highlighted, particularly in the context of the redesign of Scotland\u0027s maternity services following the Best Start review which will see mothers allocated a named midwife for all their pregnancy, labour and postnatal care.  It could see a shift away from fixed shifts to an \u0027on-call\u0027 model that would see midwives responding whenever a mother on their caseload went into labour.  The report states: \"This model of care has strong evidence of benefits for women, families and, potentially, for midwives.  \"However, the introduction of such a significantly different way of working also brings with it uncertainties for the future workforce.  \"Some older midwives may choose to retire rather than take on a new way of working and it is also not yet clear whether the new model of care will require more midwives.  \"The impact of the implementation of the Best Start review recommendations on the workforce will start to be seen over the next one to two years.\"  Read more: Only two in 300 mothers in Scotland having a home birth  However, the report praised the Scottish Government for maintaining bursaries and free tuition for student midwives at a time whether they have been axed in England and fees imposed for the first time.  The student midwife intake was also \"very significantly increased\", meaning there will be 230 starting the three-year training courses in Scotland this year compared to 178 in 2016.  Mary Ross-Davie, RCM director for Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere are some great things happening in our maternity services in Scotland, not least the very ambitious Best Start maternity programme.  \"The Scottish Government has also delivered real increases in the number of student midwives, which we welcome.  \u0026ldquoHowever, pressures on our midwives are increasing \u0026ndash the care needs of the women in our care are rising, while the number of unfilled midwifery posts is also rising. I am still concerned about the age profile of our midwifery workforce, though it is encouraging to see the \u0026lsquogreen shoots\u0026rsquo of higher numbers of younger midwives joining our service.

Around 50 MPs discussed ways and means of getting rid of her at a gathering of the European Research Group .  A number of MPs told how they had already submitted letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, and others discussed plans to follow suit.  If 48 letters are handed over a vote of no confidence would be triggered.  At a dinner with the PM\u0027s senior aides, meanwhile, MPs raised \"leadership issues\".  Backbenchers told the Prime Minister\u0027s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, his boss must \"chuck Chequers\" over a dinner at No 10.  The flurry of activity came after former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launched a fresh attack on the PM\u0027s Brexit plan, claiming it would be \"substantially worse than the status quo\" for British businesses.  Speaking after the No 10 dinner, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen did not deny suggestions the PM would face a coup.  He told ITV News: \"I\u0027ve been told that she will get a full appraisal of comments that were made over the dinner.\"  Asked if there would be a coup, he replied: \"I think we will just have to wait and see.  \"I hope that the Prime Minister will take on board what she\u0027s heard and chuck Chequers.\"  Conservative Brexiteer John Baron told ITV: \"We were discussing leadership issues.\"  Downing Street yesterday reiterated that Chequers was \"the only serious, credible and negotiable plan which is on the table which both delivers on the will of the British people and which prevents the imposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland\".

It delivers a full citizens advice service over the phone and online, through live chat, email and social media.

Multiple organ failure was said to have led to Mrs Baxter\u0026rsquos death, with sacrocolopexy mesh repair \u0026ndash an implant to fix a pelvic organ prolapse \u0026ndash noted as an underlying cause.  Her son Mark, 52, has called for the products to be completely banned.    Ms Freeman said\u0026nbspNHS boards had been told to halt the use of mesh in cases of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.This will continue until a new \"restricted use protocol\" is drawn up.  Other mesh procedures, such as transabdominal mesh, will be kept under active review and will also be subject to high vigilance procedures.She also praised the bravery of women who have come forward to share their problems following vaginal mesh surgery.  Healthcare Improvement Scotland has established a group to oversee any continued use of the treatment.  And Ms Freeman said the chief medical officer has continued to keep the issueunder review and is listening to the women who have been affected of this.  She said: \u0026ldquoI have today asked the Chief Medical Officer to instruct Health Boards to immediately halt the use of transvaginal mesh altogether in cases of both pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, pending the implementation of a new restricted use protocol that will ensure procedures are carried out only in the most exceptional circumstances and subject to a robust process of approval and fully informed consent.  \u0026ldquoThe instruction to halt is, I believe, a proportionate measure whilst a rigorous, high vigilance restricted use ptotocol for any future practice is developed and put in place.  \u0026ldquoThe lifting of this halt in use can only be considered once there is confidence that there is sufficient evidence that the protocol can only be triggered in only the most limited of circumstances \u0026ndash informed by any new evidence and the forthcoming NICE guidance which is expected in the spring of next year on the management of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.  Holyrood\u0026rsquo\u0026nbsppublic petitions committee had\u0026nbspcalled for the use of mesh implants to stop, citing \u0026ldquoserious concerns over an independent review into their use.  That review concluded the procedure \u0026ndash used in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse  and stress urinary incontinence  \u0026ndash must not be offered \u0026ldquoroutinely to women with pelvic organ prolapse.  The review was announced by the Scottish Government in 2014, with health boards requested to stop the procedure until its conclusion.  It remains under suspension in NHS Scotland except in exceptional circumstances.  The review\u0026rsquos final report was branded a \u0026ldquowhitewash by some women who have suffered painful and debilitating complications from mesh, including campaigners Elaine Holmes and Olive McIlroy.  Professor Alison Britton has been commissioned to conduct a review of the review, which is due to report later this year.      6 years of campaigning with the brilliant Elaine Holmes and @MBLacey of the Scottish mesh survivors and we have got the Scottish Govt to see sense and ban mesh implants - this could have been done 6 years ago. pic.twitter/aOuiVpoaS7  Mrs\u0026nbspBaxter\u0026nbspfrom Loanhead, died in hospital in Edinburgh last month.\u0026nbsp  She underwent mesh surgery five years ago.

And Labour MSP Neil Findlay said that he understood\u0026nbspit was the first time mesh had been specifically cited as an underlying cause of death in Scotland.  Hundreds of women in Scotland have suffered painful and debilitating complications from being given mesh implants, including infections, bleeding and even paralysis.

But critics insist it does not go far enough and will simply lead to public control of loss-making routes, leaving councils lumbered with debt.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Colin Smyth said bus fares have soared under the SNP, while passenger numbers have plummeted.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis bill is a chance to deliver real change on our buses and start to reverse the SNP\u0026rsquos decade of decline.

A new report co-written by Community Land Scotland  \u0026ndash which previously called for the regeneration of townships destroyed by the Highland Clearances \u0026ndash calls for \u0026ldquoan institutional culture change to address the problem.  Dr Calum MacLeod, director of CLS, which represents Scotland\u0026rsquos community landowners, said: \u0026ldquoMuch of the public policy around the myth of so-called \u0026lsquowild\u0026rsquo land has airbrushed the community dimension out of many of Scotland\u0026rsquos rural landscapes.

The new report, which was co-written with the Institute for Heritage and Sustainable Human Development, takes aim at Scotland\u0027s conservation policies.  It argues current models single out \u0026ldquospecial landscapes for protection, while ignoring communities and shutting them out of decisions.

Author Dr Chris Dalglish said: \u0026ldquoGenerally speaking, people are excluded when it comes to deciding what matters about Scotland\u0026rsquos landscapes and to making decisions about the conservation of those landscapes.  \u0026ldquoThere is an apparent lack of recognition for community voices in this context.

This means that Nicola Sturgeon will not be in a position at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference to give a clear view on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future because the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will still be unknown.  This is likely to disappoint many Nationalists, including those who this weekend will gather in Glasgow for a Hope over Fear Yes rally.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos future agenda, published last week, stated: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the period of negotiation with the EU, and when the terms of Brexit are clearer, we will set out our judgement on the best way forward for Scotland at that time, including our view on the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future.  It is widely thought that any deal with Brussels will now not be sealed at the October 18/19 European Council but could come at a special summit pencilled in for November 13.  This will be followed by ratification by parliaments across the EU as well as the so-called \"meaningful vote\" at Westminster on the final deal, possibly before Christmas.  However, Mr Blackford was clear that, as the informed debate on the economics of independence continued following the publication of the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report, no decision on when or whether to call for a second independence vote could be made until after the details of a deal were fully known.  He told reporters at a Westminster briefing: \u0026ldquoThe judgement we have made is we can reflect on what the options are for Scotland once we know the Brexit outcome. Now, some time ago there was an expectation that would happen in October but that is probably unlikely in October\u0026hellipIt will be presumptuous of us to give an outline of what we will do until we know what the Brexit destination is.  \u0026ldquoThere has to be clarity.

In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.

VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important.

At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent.

I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero.

The 15-minute online course is designed to give them the knowledge and confidence to recognise possible signs of child abuse. Covering all types of abuse, the training also provides them with guidance on who to tell if they have concerns about the well-being of a child.                    \" title=\"Protecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.

The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwife felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an individual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be diverted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwife whom you interviewed.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 6:02 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 6:02 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 6:03 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Thursday 13 Sep 2018 6:04 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He been a stalwart for Dingwall, helping to raise thousands of pounds in his role as chairman of the Fire Brigade Community Group, of which he has been on the committee for 54 years.He is also vice-chairman of the Seaforth Highlanders Regimental Association . He lives at Millcraig Road with wife Jennifer, and has been retired for nine years.The couple have a daughter, Lorna, who lives in Glasgow and three granddaughters, Morgan , Kayla  and Nyah .The eldest followed in her grandfather\u0026rsquos musical footsteps and gave him one of his proudest moments when she performed a senior drumming role in the Army Cadets Pipe Band parade last Easter. Mr Angus is a noted drummer and was back behind the drum kit on Saturday just prior to his accolade, entertaining the crowd.The former Dingwall Academy pupil threw himself into his drumming career ahead of a 26-year stint with North of Scotland Water Authority, which became Scottish Water. He said he enjoys helping his home town.Thursday 13 Sep 2018 6:04 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartThursday 13 Sep 2018 6:04 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Ms McDonald is nominated in the business women of the year category for firms with less than 50 staff.Also shortlisted for the same award is Anne Roberts, co-founder of Inverness-based Mime Technologies, which produces monitoring technology for use in in-flight medical emergencies and by emergency service first responders.

The party’s depute leader Keith Brown said MPs, MSPs and activists would be given a target of speaking to 50,000 people across the country on 29 September.            Revealing the plans in an interview, he said the party would be “making the case for an independent Scotland” on the doorsteps by mobilising its sizeable membership.            Earlier this month it was confirmed that the SNP had become the UK’s second largest political party, with 125,000 members to the Conservatives’ 124,000.Mr Brown said the day of action would allow the SNP to take a “huge sample of public opinion”, arguing that the time was right to make the case for independence given the “chaos of Brexit”.Citing a recent poll which found that Brexit could sway support in favour of Scottish independence, Mr Brown said he wanted activists to “mine that seam” by talking to voters.“What’s really important now is taking that message out, right in the teeth of the chaos of Brexit, to put forward our proposition of why we believe Scotland should be independent,” he said.While the party has been running street stalls to attract the attention of voters, taking its message onto the doorsteps marks a step up in its preparations for another referendum on independence.            However, Mr Brown also suggested that plans for a re-run of 2014’s vote may have to be pushed back if the timetable for the Brexit negotiations slips.“It’s not fair to confront people with another constitutional question when the constitutional question of Brexit is as yet unresolved,” he said.SNP activists will be instructed to seek voters’ views on the Growth Commission report, which attempted to reboot the economic case for independence, as well as other issues.“People just now are seeing things like their mortgages going up because interest rates are going up, the cost of food is going up, they’re hearing stories about potential food shortages, about huge queues at the borders, they’re seeing the Tory party tearing themselves apart,” Mr Brown added.            “These things do tend to change the political environment: the perceived competence or otherwise of a government and the extent to which it’s seen to be in control of events is a big factor for people. We want to find out how people are feeling about that.”The day of action is also part of the SNP’s preparations for a possible snap general election, with Mr Brown revealing that the vetting process for new candidates is already well under way. “This is putting people on the streets, which is really important. With 50-odd Tory MPs talking about taking out the Prime Minister and installing another leader, and the manoeuvres that Boris [Johnson] is on, it seemed a sensible idea.”Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the day of action would merely remind Scots that the SNP “continues to obsess over one thing” at the expense of the nation."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

We must build on this while retaining those positive traditions and values that help to define us and which have withstood the test of time and adversity.\n“The visit of the Pope Francis can and should contribute to the new and positive relationship which has been developing between the Irish state and the Catholic Church,\" she explained. \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live. This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"dont deport us back to iraq","story":"\nTWO junior Iraqi doctors who fled their war-torn nation due to death threats made to one of their lives, say they hope the Home Office will reconsider its decision to imminently deport them due to complications with their visa.\n\nSpeaking from their home off Lisburn Road’s Chadwick Street, Yosra Taleb Abdalla who shares the property with her husband Usamah Ather Ali and two young children – one of whom is aged just 20 months –  explained how she and Ali had been working as junior doctors when Ali, who worked for the Ministry for Defence in Baghdad, received a threat to his life. \n\n“We applied for a visa to Dublin and then went onto Belfast,” said Yosra. “We have been here nearly three years, from the beginning of January 2016.”\n\nYosra continued: “The people here have been extremely kind to us and the children enjoy the multicultural side of life.\n\n“We feel safe here, we are safe here we feel that no-one can hurt us here.”\n\nYosra explained how the Home Office decision, which was made in late July, refused the family’s submission for asylum and to date the family have received no further correspondence as to when they have to leave the country.\n\nAs both Yosra and Ali have not successfully secured asylum neither can work, leaving the family in limbo.\n\n“We fear we will forget all we have learned in our profession,” said Yosra. “It is our hope to work.\n\n“We were doctors in our home country, we were living a normal life, and now we are here trying to live our lives. We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountiful fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day if it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identified all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them if they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramifications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however, if we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or if Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37309828.ece/9ef2e/AUTOCROP/w620h342/120918dk1105.jpg","title":"entries now open for new look belfast city marathon","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They are pure fantasy with no attempt to set out how they can actually be achieved.\n\n“It is interesting but not surprising to note that there is absolutely no reference to rights, to freedom of movement or to the role of the European Court of Justice in these proposals.\"\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, whose party backed Brexit, said the paper presented a \"positive and timely development\".\n\n\"The paper makes clear that, in the event of a free trade deal being negotiated with the EU, there are sensible practical measures which can ensure there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,\" he said.\n\n\"It therefore accurately reflects the fact that the border issue is no impediment to the negotiation by the UK of a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. This a position we have consistently articulated.\"\n\nHe added: \"For too long some have used the border issue, and the political process in Northern Ireland more generally, to try to mould Brexit to their way of thinking or to thwart it altogether. That should stop.\"\n\nMany of the technology-based solutions put forward in Wednesday\u0027s paper have \npreviously been rebuked\n by experts in the field.\n\nIn August 2017, the Centre for Irish and European Security said suggestions of a \"frictionless\" border were \"complete nonsense\".\n\n\n\n\nRees-Mogg: I have a Brexit plan for Northern Ireland\n \n\n\n\nIn the new paper, the group propose the Government should agree equivalence of UK and EU regulations and conformity assessment for all agricultural goods on the island of Ireland.\n\n\n\nThe EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland.\nEuropean Research Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland and the Republic would be maintained as a Common Biosecurity Zone after Brexit, allowing the smooth movement of these products across the border.\n\n“Since UK and EU standards are identical and will remain identical at the point of departure, determining equivalence after Brexit should be straightforward,” said the document.\n\nFor other goods, the ERG said existing simplified customs procedures could continue to be used to avoid the need for checks at the border.\n\nLarger companies would use “trusted trader” schemes to clear their goods for export and import, and other declarations would be incorporated into the existing system used for VAT returns.\n\n“The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland,” said the ERG paper, launched in Westminster.\n\n“At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg arrives at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall to discuss the group’s proposals \n\n\n\n\n“The one element of ‘alignment’ necessary is the maintenance of the current Common Biosecurity Zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious.\n\n“The necessary procedures described can all be implemented within the existing legal and operational frameworks of the EU and the UK, based on the mutual trust on which regular trade depends.\n\n“Rational, pragmatic approaches can ensure that the vital trade across the border is maintained. At the same time, this allows the United Kingdom to conduct an independent trade policy without threatening the integrity of the EU single market.”\n\nThe ERG said its proposals could be delivered without the need for any new infrastructure at the border and without weakening North-South co-operation.\n\n“There is nothing which would reduce our commitment to the Belfast Agreement, or which might jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland,” the group said.\n\n“Harnessing the latest developments in international best practice can deliver continued co-operation and prosperity in the best interests of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37310067.ece/3e7cc/AUTOCROP/w620h342/SoSPrimark01.jpg","title":"secretary of state says northern ireland interview was taken out of context","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That’s a very different world from the world I came from.” \n\nSince her admission last week the interview has inspired the #ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew on Twitter.\n\nFrom where the international airport is, or isn\u0027t, to how people across the divide take their tea, there has been all manner of hilarity.\n\n\"The Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners,\" joked one scamp.\n\n\"Makes Twitter worth it,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long. \n\n\"We might have more than our fair share of problems but when it comes to dark humour and laughing at ourselves  we really excel,\" the MLA said. \n\n\"I\u0027m not particularly worried about Karen Bradley\u0027s lack of knowledge about here before she was appointed Secretary of State,\" said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. \n\n\"I\u0027m very concerned about her lack of action since she arrived.\"\n\n\nThe Guddies are for wearing on your feet and not a 70s TV show starring Bill Oddie. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Marty Morgan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nMost dogs in Northern Ireland are called Ormo because they\u0027re well bread \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— DaddyTayto  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Ewing was in the shower all the time... \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Arvo McPart #FBPE #ABTV #Remain  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\nGordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White and Jamie Oliver all hail from Cookstown.\n— Ryan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nA dreary monday Morning brightened considerably by \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Davy Sims  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n\nCatholics put green Milk in their cereal and Protestants put Blue Milk on theirs...\n— Slim™  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n \n\nMaze prison was actually a Maze and once prisoners found the exit they were allowed to leave.\n— Tim McCullagh  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast International Airport isn\u0027t actually in Belfast \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— David McCann  \nSeptember 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Norris was in the RA \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— The_Flamming_Cahoot  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Paisley was widely misunderstood When he called for an end to \u0027Popery\u0027 he was actually decrying the popular 1980\u0027s perfumed wooden shavings which many middle class women kept in an ornate dish in the living room. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Shirley Anne McMillan  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners.\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— TimesIwonder  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n we still have to check under our cars for leprechauns \npic.twitter/zrpRnWxSR7\n\n— Julie Watson  \nSeptember 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\"...and I know it\u0027s famous for building the world\u0027s most famous ship - the Starship Enterprise.

Progress! \nhttps:t.co/TJE30CLgIY\n thank you \n@peta\n \n@LondonFashionWk\n 💥🌈🎉🎊\n— Paloma Faith  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the BFC has not itself imposed a ban on fur being used, and insists it will support choices made by brands at the biannual event.\n\nThe 68th London Fashion Week comes as the industry contributed £32.3 billion to the UK economy in 2017 – a 5.4% increase on 2016.\n\nFashion remains a major UK employer with 890,000 jobs across the industry, up 1.8% on 2016.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"8 of the best questions and answers from a nasa astronauts","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double.

The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place.

Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

It is something they want to try and address to make the town even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.\n\nMournes councillor Laura Devlin said that due to the force of nature there was no way of maintaining a sandy beach, which was why s he believed a pop-up beach on top of the promenade was an alternative worth pursuing.\n\nShe believes the move would provide Newcastle with that beachy summer feel and was pleased council officers were to examine if a temporary beach could be provided and the costs involved.\n\n\u0026ldquoTourism is the district\u0026rsquos biggest economic driver so let\u0026rsquos see what more we can do to improve the product we have to offer and provide a new outdoor amenity for people in the resort as well, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Environment Agency has determined, along with other coastal erosion experts, that due to the construction\u0026nbsp\n\nof the promenade, sand is naturally depleted from Newcastle beach and there will never be enough of it to form a usable beach. In addition, efforts to place sand on the beach would be counterproductive.\n\n\u0026ldquoMany countries have provided artificial beaches which have proved very successful and I think we need to look at all the options and costings for a similar scheme on our own promenade.\n\nCllr Michael Ruane said he had no issue exploring the merits of a temporary beach and pointed to a successful scheme which dumped tonnes of sand on Warrenpoint beach a number of years ago.\n\nHe proposed Environment Agency officials be invited to address politicians about the possibility of adding sand to Newcastle beach with the initial focus on this project and also look at the option for a temporary beach on the promenade.\n\nSupport was also voiced by councillors Glyn Hanna, Henry Reilly, Brian Quinn and Andrew McMurray and the proposal was unanimously endorsed.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Union officials urging council workers’ unity  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTRADE unions urged workers to stand together as they protested outside Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos headquarters in Downpatrick on Monday night.\n\nMore than 80 council employees and local trade union representatives attended a protest rally at the Downshire estate offices as councillors arrived for the monthly meeting.\n\nThe protest comes just days after the council\u0026rsquos 1,400 trade union members began to vote on whether or not to take industrial action.\n\nThe highly vocal protest was not discussed by councillors inside the council chamber, although several councillors stopped to listen to speeches before going in.\n\nA ballot of council workers by their four trade unions \u0026mdash GMB, NIPSA, SIPTU and UNITE \u0026mdash started last Friday.\n\nTension between council management and the joint trade union has increased in recent weeks, following a vote of no confidence by trade union members in council chief executive Liam Hannaway.\n\nThe joint trade unions side claims that employee terms and conditions are being eroded as the council introduces job-matching as part of the legacy council restructuring process to lower ranks of employees.\n\nHowever, the council hit back with a statement last night.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
