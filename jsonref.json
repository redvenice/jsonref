But now the Arsenal manager finds himself wondering how much he can risk putting into this game. On one hand, the match has assumed greater importance because of last weekend’s elimination from the FA Cup, which leaves this thing as the only silverware Arsenal can win this season on the other hand, they face Spurs on Sunday with north London pride on the line as well as points that could prove crucial in the race for the Premier League’s top four (and reaching that, according to late-era Arsène Wenger, is as good as winning a trophy). Considering that, and the uncertain fitness levels of players, it’s a tricky business trying to predict how Arsenal will line up today. There’s uncertainty around Liverpool’s lineup too. We know they are shorn of their three best attacking players, with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané at the Africa Cup of Nations and Divock Origi injured (don’t bother writing in). But Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino is available again, as are Virigl Van Dijk and Allison at the other end. Andy Robertson may be, too. So Liverpool can be expected to try to tear into Arsenal and rack up a first-leg lead that Arteta’s team won’t be able to overturn a the Emirates.

File photograph: Damien MeyerAFP via Getty ImagesThe milder impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on infected people and hospitals has led the Government to relax the rules on isolation and testing to allow more people return to work and to protect essential public services. Here is a guide to what you need to know about the new rules in this regard.What are the changes?The Government has agreed to loosen rules on Covid-19 testing, self-isolation guidance for those who test positive for the virus, and restrictions for people who are close contacts of Covid cases.What is the biggest change?The most significant difference is on fully vaccinated close contacts who have received their vaccine booster and are not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19. They no longer have to restrict their movements for five days. Instead, they are being asked to wear a medical (typically blue) or higher-grade face mask (the typically white FFP2N95 variety) for 10 days when in crowded or enclosed spaces and to take regular antigen tests over seven days, with the last test on day seven. Close contacts who have not been boosted only have to restrict their movements for seven days, instead of the 10 previously recommended.Close contacts of any age who have themselves recovered following Covid-19 detected by a PCR or antigen test since December 1st are not required to restrict movements or test if asymptomatic.What effect will these particular changes have?This new arrangement will likely affect tens of thousands of people who are stuck at home and cannot go to work, ensuring – most importantly – that essential services can continue.What is happening with testing?Previously if people between the ages of four and 39 with symptoms tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test, they had to get an official PCR test through the HSE to confirm their infection. From now on, anyone who has a positive antigen test no longer needs to go for a PCR test. They can register their positive antigen test result on and upload their close contacts to the HSE’s system and antigen tests will then be sent out to their close contacts.What is changing in relation to the rules for those who test positive for Covid-19?There has been no change in the rule for people who have received the vaccine boosters: if these people test positive, they still have to self-isolate for seven days. For those who have not received a booster dose who test positive, however, they only have to self-isolate for seven days, instead of the 10 previously. In other words, everyone who tests positive for Covid-19 will only have to isolate for seven days. People should only exit self-isolation after seven days if their symptoms have substantially or fully resolved for the final two of those seven days.Are any additional precautions being recommended?For 10 days including any isolation periods, both confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts are advised to limit close contacts with people outside their household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces to wear a face mask in crowded spaces to take an antigen test before entering crowded spaces or prior to close contact with others outside their household, and to work from home if possible.Everyone over 12 who tests positive should wear a medical grade or FFP2 face mask for 10 days under this new advice and children aged between nine and 12 who test positive should wear a well-fitted mask for 10 days. Any close contacts over 12 who have not been boosted should wear an FFP2 or medical grade mask for 10 days. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that booster vaccines for children aged 12 to 15 will be considered shortly.When will these changes come into effect?From midnight on Thursday, so most people will not enjoy the benefit of these changes until they wake up on Friday morning.Will the State be sending out antigen tests and medical and respirator masks for free?The HSE is already sending out antigen tests to close contacts but the Government is not planning on providing them to the general public. There are no plans to distribute free medical-grade masks or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks. Opposition parties have called on the Government to cover the cost of both antigen tests and medical grade masks for all households.What has led to these rule changes?New EU advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued last weekend paved the way, with a change in guidance for close contacts. The ECDC said that if any close contacts had a negative PCR or antigen test, they may not need to restrict their movements so long as they self-monitor for symptoms, continue to wear a mask and stay away from vulnerable groups. Dr Holohan told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in a letter on Tuesday that the updated guidance from the ECDC, considering the rapid spread of Omicron in Europe, aimed to provide options on quarantine, particularly when countries face “high or extreme pressure” on health systems and other essential services.What is the motivation to make the changes now when daily case numbers are still so high?The vast number of confirmed Omicron infections since Christmas has affected two or three times this number because of people being identified as close contacts of those cases. Given that Dr Holohan estimated that up to 500,000 people were likely to have been infected last week, this would mean well in excess of 1 million additional people may be forced to stay at home, based on the average number of close contacts. The Government had expressed concern that the rules on close contacts were causing major difficulties for businesses and public services. An estimated 15,000 HSE staff are currently out on Covid-related leave, putting hospitals under severe pressure.Is it premature given the high number of cases?Some have suggested that it is, particularly when the seven-day average of new daily cases is still north of 20,000. Dublin City University immunology professor Christine Loscher expressed surprise at the “blanket” easing of close contact requirements amid concerns over how much more transmissible the Omicron variant was and how little was known about what percentage of close contacts become infected.How do the changes compare with what is happening in other countries?In the UK, since Tuesday, most people with a positive antigen test have not been required to take a confirmatory PCR test to confirm they have Covid-19. Last week, Germany reduced self-isolation for positive Covid-19 cases and close contacts from 14 days to 10, with the option to end their isolation period on day seven with a Covid-19 test. The US has gone further, reducing the amount of time that confirmed Covid-19 cases must isolate to five days last month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ashling murphy she was a shining light as a teacher the children in her class adored her","story":"Floral tributes near to the scene in Tullamore, Co Offaly, after Ashling Murphy, was killed on Wednesday evening. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire The principal of Durrow National School where Ashling Murphy taught first class has described the newly qualified teacher as “a shining light” and said “her pupils adored her”.Children had been coming into school this morning with tears in their eyes, James Hogan told RTÉ radio’s News at One, but although she was not there, she was not forgotten by her class or her colleagues.The school community was devastated to have lost a colleague and a friend, a person who brought light with her and who would put a smile on anyone’s face, he added.Mr Hogan said that the children in the school had been invited to write “little messages” to Ms Murphy which were being put into a memory box for her.Although she had been in the school for a relatively short time – since March 2021 – she had made a “huge impact” and “fit in so well”, said Mr Hogan. “Her personality, her bubbliness, her smile, her talents. She would reach out to any child.“She was one in a million. It’s heart-breaking that it was all taken from her.”Mr Hogan said the priority of the school community was to care for the children and staff, and supports had been put in place. Staff had met early this morning for a briefing at which “there were waves of tears”, he said.Mr Hogan said that the thoughts and prayers of everyone in the school were with the Murphy family as they attempt to cope with the loss of their lovely daughter.Bouquets of flowers and a candle have been left on the bank of the Grand Canal in Tullamore, Co Offaly, close to where Ms Murphy was killed.She had been out for a run along a canal towpath when she was fatally attacked on Wednesday afternoon.Damian White, principal of Killeigh National School in Co Offaly where Ms Murphy had carried out her teaching practice three years ago, said she was a fabulous young teacher and person.“She was just setting out on what was going to be a great teaching career.”Mr White described how he had been at a local football match when news of the murder began to circulate.“You could actually get a sense that the crowd were all hearing what was after happening at the same time. Interest was lost in the match…suddenly there was nobody talking football. Then when it emerged who it was, it’s actually mind-blowing.”‘Absolute gem’Former principal of Durrow National School Frank Kelly, who is also a friend of the Murphy family, told The : “She was a shining light as a teacher, the children in her class adored her. Her word was gold, they worshiped the ground she walked on.”He added: “She was an absolute gem. She came to the school as a substitute teacher in March 2021 and was then put on a fixed-term position from September.“Ashling was very musical, she had recently bought a set of uilleann pipes and was going to learn how to play them, they are a very difficult instrument to master, but no obstacle was too big for her. She also loved her sports and was involved with the choir.“Her smile would light up a room.”Mr Kelly returned to the school today to assist in implementing the critical incident plan. Counsellors from NEPS met with teachers at the school at 8am to prepare them for how best to explain what had happened to the children and to assist them in processing their loss.The president of Mary Immaculate College (MIC) in Limerick, where Ms Murphy studied, said: “The entire MIC community is heartbroken and shocked to the core to hear of the tragic and senseless killing of Ashling Murphy who graduated from MIC only three months ago. Our heartfelt sympathy go out to her family, friends, colleagues and pupils. RIP Ashling.”The flag in the college is at half mast, there is a remembrance table with her photograph and a lighted candle, and a memorial page is due to be set up on Friday.The college chaplain Fr Michael Wall said her death would also have an effect on the hundreds of students and teachers at the college, and set out the young woman’s achievements.“She’d come through primary school, come through secondary school, got the course she wanted did very well in that course despite the Covid stuff and went out with a very good honours degree and then got a job at home,” he told RTÉ’s Drivetime programme.“She achieved all the things that loads of parents would like their children to achieve, or loads of students would like to achieve.”In a statement on social media, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation said “for such an appalling tragedy to befall a young woman, who only recently began her teaching career, adds to the profound sense of loss and grief felt”.The secondary school that Ms Murphy attended, Sacred Heart School Tullamore, said in a post on Facebook that she was a “vibrant member of our school community during her six years here and she will be sadly missed”.Always smilingMs Murphy played with the KilcormacKilloughey Camogie club in Co Offaly. A statement by the club said: “It is with profound sadness, devastation and shock that we learned of the untimely and tragic death of our friend Ashling Murphy.“Ashling was a much-loved member of our junior and senior teams, having also played underage for the club. She entered and exited the pitch with a smile every time, was enthusiastic and pleasant to everyone, while also being quietly determined and dedicated, often driving from college in Limerick to attend training.“She will be sadly missed by her devastated friends and teammates.”In an unsigned handwritten message left with flowers at the scene of her death, a local person wrote: “You were one of the kindest girls I’ve met. Always helpful, always had a smile on your face. You were a great mentor on and off the pitch. Fly high angel. Rest in peace.”Tina Stones, who works in a corner shop nearby, said it was a sad day for the country. “A sad day for women, sad that you can’t go for a walk in broad daylight and feel safe. She was after working a hard day and never made it home,” Ms Stones said.“I find it hard to talk about it because I get too upset. It’s horrific. Even last night someone commented that there was no one out walking the streets on their own.“Normally women would be out walking early. It’s a sad day for women and a sad day for Ireland that this happened.“We all walk there and everyone knows everyone who walks it and you all say hello to each other.”Tim Malone, a resident of Thornsbury Estate, which is also close to the Grand Canal, said: “It’s disgraceful that you can’t go down there and do what you want to do. It’s terrible. It’s a grand place to go.A man in his 40s is in custody at Tullamore Garda station.

Illustration: HammersonSome of first plans for Dublin city’s most prominent redevelopment site, the 5.5-acre plot stretching from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, have been approved by Dublin City Council. UK property group Hammerson last June lodged three applications for a mixed retail, office and residential scheme on the large north inner city block formerly known as the Carlton site, parts of which have lain vacant and derelict for more than 40 years.The site, which stretches west from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, and north from Henry Street to Parnell Street, is being developed under six separate planning applications.Two of the first three applications, which focus on Moore Street and Henry Street, and include residential, hotel, retail, restaurant and cafe and cultural uses, have now been approved by the council.In relation to the third application which largely pertains to the northern end of Moore Street at O’Rahilly Parade, the council has asked Hammerson to revise its plans. The council is seeking an amended daylight and sunlight analysis on the effect the development will have on neighbouring apartments.However, the two approved applications are the more substantial, with one involving the land surrounding the 1916 Rising National Monument buildings at 14-17 Moore Street.These State-owned buildings are due to be developed separately as a 1916 Rising Commemorative Centre, a project expected to cost at least €16.25 million.The application surrounding this site had been controversial as it proposed a large archway beside the national monument, leading into an open courtyard, which broke up the Moore Street terrace. As part of the conditions attached to the grant of permission the archway must be reduced in scale and its detailing more closely aligned to 17 Moore Street. The second approved application, which deals with buildings on Henry Street and the southern end of Moore Street, involved the construction of a nine-storey hotel, and the demolition of two buildings, one at 38 Henry Street would be replaced with a new passageway into the site. The other, number 41 Henry Street, at the corner of Moore Street, would be replaced with a new building.The Department of Housing had made a submission to the council opposing the demolition of number 38 Henry Street, saying it was “unnecessary”. However the council has approved its removal.The site was for years known as the Carlton site as originally it just encompassed the old Carlton cinema, the plot beside it that had been vacant since 1979, and some backlands between O’Connell Street and Moore Street.Hammerson three years ago decided to scrap the existing 2010 planning permission for a €1.25 billion enclosed shopping complex on the site which runs west from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, and north of Henry Street to Parnell Street.Instead it plans a more open scheme which will restore the historic street pattern, and will include a new east-west pedestrian street between O’Connell Street and Moore Street, two new civic squares, shops, offices, apartments, hotels and an underground station for the new link rail line.As part of the next three applications the facade of the old cinema will be restored, though the cinema itself will not be retained in situ. Three protected structures, 42 O’Connell Street – the last remaining Georgian house on the street, O’Connell Hall at the back of No 42, and Conway’s pub, will also be restored.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"north korean women pay heavy price as kim turns on black market breadwinners","story":"A man buys flowers at a stall near the Pyongyang railway station on March 8h, 2021,   International Women’s Day. Photograph: Kim Won-jinAFP via Getty ImagesSeol Song-a remembers when she decided it was time to “buy myself a husband”. Born in the late 1960s, Seol grew up poor and hungry in the industrial city of Sunchon, north of Pyongyang. But after years working on a construction site, her life changed in the early 1990s when she started selling penicillin pilfered from the pharmaceuticals factory where her mother worked.It was a time of rising demand for medicine: the country’s economy and state-directed food rationing system had collapsed in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union, leading to a famine that is believed to have killed millions of people. Armed with her mother’s expertise as a chemist, Seol started to produce medicines herself, hiring several employees and bribing public officials to protect her from arrest.Yet despite the money she was earning, Seol still needed a politically-connected husband to make up for her own lowly status in North Korea’s patriarchal society as a woman from a family that languished at the bottom of the country’s political caste system, or songbun.“In the past, a woman with a pretty face and a certain job was regarded as a good bride,” she says. “After the famine, women who were good at doing business were considered the best. I could have any man I wanted.” With her capital and his political connections, she bought a large house and converted it into a confectionery factory, an illicit private enterprise that served markets across the entire province.Seol – who escaped the country a decade ago – was one of thousands of North Korean women to develop a black market business under the nose of the authorities, filling the void left by a bankrupt and incapacitated state. In time, they emerged as a new entrepreneurial class, driving the spread of markets, taking on responsibility for feeding North Korean society, and challenging traditional gender roles in the process.Social influenceBy the time North Korean leader Kim Jong-un imposed an extreme lockdown in January 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, women dominated an informal economy estimated to contribute more than 70 per cent of the country’s household incomes.They were also much more likely to defect – 80.7 per cent of North Koreans arriving in South Korea in 2019 were female compared with just 12.2 per cent in 1998, according to the South Korean government – making them disproportionately responsible for the remittances sent by iniduals in China and South Korea upon which many North Korean families depend.Yet, despite their market power and newfound social influence, North Korean women remain vulnerable to antediluvian social attitudes and the predations of the state, say experts who have conducted extensive interviews with escapees from the country.Deprived of social and political status, even those able to acquire large amounts of capital depend on “protection” from male officials and family members. Those unable to pay bribes or fulfil state-mandated quotas of cash and goods are routinely expected to do hard labour or can fall victim to sexual abuse at the hands of predatory officials.And with Kim having sealed the country’s borders with China and Russia and forced out foreign diplomats, aid workers and NGOs since the start of the pandemic, North Korea’s women are expected to pay a disproportionately heavy price. The regime, fearful of unrest amid chronic food shortages, is moving to reassert state control over the very areas of the informal economy dominated by women.“North Korean women are not just victims they are entrepreneurs, market actors, and providers for their family,” says Sea Young Kim, a researcher at Yonsei University in Seoul. “These draconian border restrictions don’t just threaten their supply chains. They also prevent the women themselves – and their stories – from getting out.”PatriarchyIn July 1946, the Provisional People’s Committee for North Korea, a precursor to the present day Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), enacted a law on sex equality stating that “women hold equal social status and rights with men in all areas of state, economic, cultural, social and political life”.North Korea has maintained the fiction ever since, claiming in a submission to the UN in 2016 that “all the policies, laws and sector-specific action programmes of the DPRK accord women equal rights with men on the principle of zero tolerance of discrimination against them in all their forms and any affront to their dignity”.The reality is very different. In a country in which there is officially no unemployment and in which all citizens are assigned roles by the state, those women who are not registered as housewives tend to be confined to certain sectors of the economy such as health, education, or retail.Those who work in other sectors are mostly assigned to back office or secretarial roles in overwhelmingly male-run public institutions, or forced to do hard labour cutting down trees, building roads or working on construction sites in areas where there are shortages of male workers.This state-imposed patriarchy is upheld by the country’s public distribution system of food rations. Women are expected both by the state and society to marry, and their rations are then allocated to the husband, who is registered as the “master of the household”.But if the public distribution system reinforced North Korean women’s dependence on their spouses, the country’s economic collapse in the 1990s afforded them an opportunity to forge a different role.“Men were still expected to turn up to unpaid jobs in factories, state enterprises and public institutions, leaving it to women to go looking for food and engaging in grassroots market activity,” says Kim Sung-kyung, a professor at the University of North Korea Studies in Seoul. “The irony is that their low status under this patriarchal system gave them more space to act independently.”Many sold clothes or foodstuffs or offered services such as cleaning, child-minding or hairdressing. It led to the creation of trading networks in products ranging from shoes to baby formula, foreign pharmaceuticals, herbs and noodle and bread-making machines that ned the country and stretched across the border into China.“People often imagine market activity in North Korea as something stationary, like women sitting at market stalls, but it is actually very mobile,” says Hanna Song of the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB) in Seoul. “Unlike North Korean men, the women aren’t necessarily expected to report to a certain place every day. They can bribe their local neighbourhood surveillance, train conductors and law enforcement officials to get around.”Many women engaged in trade simply to help their families survive, but others formed the backbone of a new entrepreneurial class. In some cases, this caused tensions with male spouses as women became the main breadwinners.“The system changed to one in which women feed the family and men go and sit all day at their workplace,” says Hyun Hyang (38), who before she escaped the country used to smuggle South Korean cosmetics from China and sell them out of her house in the northern city of Hyesan. “So gradually, the women’s voices got louder and men started losing their voice.”Surveillance societyAll North Koreans belong to an inminban, a neighbourhood watch unit consisting of between 30 and 40 households that is typically presided over by an older married woman who monitors every aspect of its members’ lives on behalf of the state.One woman who spoke to the Financial Times, whose name and hometown have been withheld to protect her identity, served as the head of an inminban in a rural area in the north of the country. She saw first hand how the lives of the women in her community changed during the 1990s.When in 2002 the regime legalised and licensed the operation of a limited number of market stalls around the country, it amounted to official acceptance of the role that predominantly female traders had played in filling the void left by the collapse of the country’s rationing system.By 2020, there were at least 436 official markets in North Korea, each with up to 20,000 stalls operated exclusively by women and raising approximately $56.8 million per year in revenue for the government, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.But, as they have emerged as drivers of this grassroots activity, North Korea’s women have increasingly been targeted by the state.Through the inminban, the regime has an intimate knowledge of each family’s circumstances. “We knew every detail of each household: births, deaths, jobs, children, who had relatives in China, how many guests dropped by,” says the former inminban leader who now lives outside the country. “We knew the contents of everybody’s home, down to the last spoon and chopstick.”All North Koreans are expected to deliver their inidual quotas to local authorities, which in turn are expected to meet the demands of ministries in Pyongyang. Even children are expected to participate in the construction and refurbishment of their own schools in order to be permitted to attend lessons, according to escapee testimonies.“The North Korean government tacitly accepts that it cannot maintain its economy without the operation of black markets, so it extracts as much from them as it possibly can,” says Joanna Hosaniak of the Citizens’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul.Double-edged swordThe main vehicle for the state to extract cash, goods or labour from married women is via the Women’s Union, a Workers’ Party organisation that they must join unless they are a member of another party entity.Members must deliver quotas to the Women’s Union to satisfy demands for everything from kilos of silkworm cocoons to kidney beans or matsutake mushrooms for the regime to sell for foreign currency, or scrap iron for a local construction project.For female traders, their relative prosperity has become a double-edged sword. “The more you are able to accumulate, the more you will be exploited,” says Hosaniak, who has interviewed senior members of the Women’s Union. “Rather than empowering women, their earning power made them a target.”As they are more likely than men to engage in mobile illegal or semi-legal economic activity, North Korean women are also more likely to find themselves at the mercy of officialdom in a country where sexual exploitation is rife, say escapees.This culture of abuse pervades all echelons of the state apparatus – something that has been acknowledged by victims and perpetrators alike.“At some point in the night, each of us picked our favourite actresses from films we watched and asked the hotel lobby staff to bring them to us. Whomever we chose would be at our room door within the hour,” a former high-ranking secret police agent told US campaign group Human Rights Watch in 2016 when describing his monthly drinking sessions with colleagues.“We were powerful and influential, we paid them, and they knew that if we liked them they could call us if they got into trouble or needed a favour.”‘Capitalist mindset’Against a backdrop of chronic food shortages, severe pandemic restrictions and a series of devastating droughts and floods, Kim Jong-un is moving to reimpose ideological orthodoxies redolent of the reign of his grandfather, founding leader Kim Il-sung.In a letter read out to the Seventh Congress of the Women’s Union in June 2021, the young dictator exhorted North Korean women to wear traditional clothing, write encouraging letters to male soldiers, and protect children from “alien ideology, culture and lifestyles”.“It is only in the last two or three years that Kim has started trying to reimpose traditional gender roles,” says Kim Sung-kyung. “North Korean women are marrying later, having fewer children, and prioritising market activity. To the regime, this represents a capitalist mindset that is getting out of control.”Analysts say that many of the economic opportunities afforded to North Korean women in recent decades are likely to be closed off as the regime maintains its stranglehold on cross-border trade and Kim attempts to reassert his control over the market mechanisms that sprang up in response to the collapse of the rationing system.What is less clear, say observers, is how generations of North Korean women with a newfound sense of agency will respond to the revival of the “male-dominated state”.“The ability to make money by bringing in goods from abroad, and the ability to escape, were the two main pressure valves for many women living in North Korea, and now both of those are under threat,” says Song at the NKDB.“Before the famine, women were able to stay at home – they didn’t know anything about earning money,” says Hyun. “But after experiencing these market activities, it would be very difficult for them to go back to where they were.”It is a sentiment echoed by Seol Song-a. “I was bringing in all the money, and yet I kept asking myself why I was born as a woman, why I have to wash his socks. Who made the law saying that women should do the laundry?” asks Seol, who left North Korea – and her husband – in 2010 to set up a business in China, and now lives in Seoul.“Before she died, my mother told me that she had spent her life waiting for rations,” she adds. “I have never forgotten that.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris has outlived usefulness conservative party readers right","story":"As Boris Johnson faces mounting calls from MPs and the public alike to resign as Prime Minister after admitting attending a Downing Street garden party on May 20, 2020, there is speculation that he could face a no-confidence vote.The most prominent call for his resignation comes from Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Tories, who said Mr Johnson\u0027s position was no longer tenable. But a number of Cabinet ministers rallied behind the Prime Minister on Wednesday evening to publicly shore up his support. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, for example, insists Boris Johnson is the right person to be Prime Minister.With the Prime Minister facing a barrage of criticism from all angles, the question stands: Is he still the right man for the job?  readers have taken to the comments section to share their views on whether Mr Johnson should remain leader, and indeed who they think should replace him.Read on to see what your fellow readers had to say.@Tim Cooke:Sadly, it doesn\u0027t matter at all whether Johnson stays or goes. The cabinet is stuffed full of mediocre characters who will simply carry on with the same policies we\u0027ve seen since Blair, Cameron, May and now Johnson.When did you last hear a senior politician give a truly historic speech? A speech worth taking some quotes from? Not from any of the current parliament. They\u0027re all career politicians interested only in climbing the ladder and nothing to do with bettering our once great country.We need a return to local selection of candidates. Let the people decide who would be good for their own community.@James Jeffery:The Tory MPs have made a colossal error of judgement in not backing their leader to the hilt. You \u0027circle the wagons\u0027 in a political crisis, failure to do so (in this case) could mean defeat in the next election whichever new leader is elected. More should have been made of the fact that both Boris and Oliver Dowden spoke of \u0027public\u0027 spaces in which to walk and exercise the Downing Street garden was obviously a private place. I noticed in repeatedly talking about \u0027double standards\u0027 the BBC commentators dropped the \u0027public\u0027 in their analysis, which Michael Fabricant had first pointed out on The World Tonight a few days ago. I have issues with Boris but this baying for his blood, the use of private grief as a public weapon, and the pathetic self-righteousness of the Labour front bench is frankly sickening.This is not just about Boris. We have allowed our governments to be formed by self-serving, career-minded politicians, most of whom have not experienced ordinary, paying jobs, or had to rely on state benefits. The majority have not had to choose the \u0027best\u0027 schools for their children in often low-achieving leagues. They have not had to buy a house in an area they can afford, rather than in a good neighbourhood.Furthermore, most of them have never lived in an area that never sees a policeman but where low-level crime, vandalism, antisocial behaviour, and shoplifting are rife. This applies to all parties - just look at Starmer. At the next general election, we need real people as candidates, not just PM aspirers. Otherwise, turnout will be even more abysmal as the electorate abandon democracy. I’m sure I will not be the only person spoiling a ballot paper because all the candidates are clones of each other.@Geoffrey Thirlby:If you\u0027re an old Tory from the Southern heartlands or a new Tory from the Red Wall seats, Boris Johnson is now a liability. He delivered a three-quarter-full Brexit, leaving Northern Ireland in limbo. Yes, he delivered on getting the Covid vaccine rolled out, but his ridiculous green agenda, the raising of taxes, his failure to foresee the current energy crisis by cutting back on natural gas production and storage and the abuse of regulations by the No 10 prove he is not fit to be Prime Minister.I want a Tory Prime Minister who is a true Conservative, not a woke, green liberal. The whole Party seems to be losing sight of what their electorate voted for.@J Ward:Boris should go, but that has nothing to do with this nonsense that provides the excuse. Boris has outlived his usefulness to the Conservative Party and has now turned woke and \u0027green\u0027 under the influence of his woke wife - for whom we did not vote.We need some letters to go into the 1922 committee and a swift election with Liz Truss as the winner. We must not have the dithering which we had over the May fiasco. It will be quickly forgotten this way.It\u0027s time to rebuild our political system from the roots upwards. Parliament is full of self-serving lightweights. If you have no confidence in your sitting MP, let them know about your concerns. I have total confidence in my MP, who is a member of the Government. He is honest, direct and always prepared to discuss constituents\u0027 concerns. If he continues with his support for Boris Johnson, that\u0027s good enough for me. I am not an uncritical supporter of Johnson, but am far from happy about any push from the media to remove him from office.@CIJS:I do not in any way condone what Boris did during a time of insurmountable suffering and loss, and once trust is lost, it is gone forever. However, there are a lot of people throwing stones in glass houses, and if Boris was to resign, who is competent enough to replace him? There is currently no one.Boris Johnson really has to go. He\u0027s a self-serving shambles. It would be good to see a principled inidual as PM - say Iain Duncan Smith, but unlikely. Perhaps Liz Truss. Penny Mordaunt doesn\u0027t seem to be mentioned much, but is someone I think would be great in the PM job.I will always be grateful to Boris for, firstly, supporting the Leave campaign, for delivering Brexit and also for enacting the world-beating vaccine campaign. These are three massive achievements for which he will be remembered well by those on the Right.However, Boris is now doing damage to the institution of Prime Minister (one which I still have a fair amount of respect for) and I do hope he resigns.I want Farage and Tice. I want Fox. I want proper Conservatives like David Davies and Andrew Rosindell. I want people like this to throw in their lot with a new project to rid this country of opportunism, wokery, hypocrisy and the unpatriotic slide into darkness which the Blair and Cameron consensus started and which Johnson has failed to address once the Brexit referendum was won.We need a new Battle of Britain to win hearts and minds and get Global Britain on the map.Join our webinar and chat to  journalists about Boris Johnson\u0027s leadership tomorrow Friday January 14 at middayMore from News‘Don’t hide your age with facelifts’: Jenny Agutter gets under the skin of ‘self-obsessed’ actorsSki holidays back on as France lifts UK Covid travel banWas the Russian flu a ‘coronavirus’?

For this and other acts of political courage and determination she earned the reputation and title of the Iron Lady.Our Foreign Secretary has modelled herself on Mrs Thatcher. From her tough talking to tank driving, her pride in her country and promotion of it as trade secretary, she has won the admiration of the Conservative Party faithful and is now one of the highest regarded cabinet ministers. However her popularity is not only based on the image she has promoted but also on the effective way she delivered over 70 trade deals in the short period after we left the EU, so silencing the Remain critics who argued that leaving the EU would leave the UK isolated, poorer and bereft of export markets.She now faces another massive challenge as she starts talks with Maroš Šefčovič. She has to replace the NI Protocol with arrangements which undo the damage to the NI economy, and more importantly ensure that the protocol arrangements which have made NI an annex of the EU, and undermined the sovereignty of the UK government in that part of the UK, are removed. In simple terms she has to demand and secure an agreement which restores NI to being a full part of the UK.These negotiations will be a test as to whether she is an Iron Lady or a tinfoil cut out. In the face of an EU team which still has as its remit the task of punishing the UK for daring to leave the EU and using NI as a warning to other countries that a severe price will be exacted against them if they have the temerity to dare break free, the Foreign Secretary will have to use all her considerable negotiating skills and demonstrate her determination. There is much at stake. In her hands rest the responsibility of getting Brexit done and undoing the massive damage done to the integrity of the UK by the NI Protocol.Furthermore, consumers in NI are now unable to purchase goods from companies in their own country and customs and taxes are levied on a whole range of goods supplied to NI. If the government decides to use the fiscal freedom which Brexit gives to reduce VAT on energy bills, the measure could not apply in NI because NI remains under EU VAT rules.The economic damage is nothing compared to the constitutional damage caused by the Protocol. Indeed it stems from it. Whilst nominally NI remains part of the UK, in effect UK laws as they relate to manufacturing, agriculture and fiscal policies cannot apply to NI if they are in conflict with EU law. All past and future EU laws in these areas will apply in NI without any input by NI politicians or the UK government. Furthermore their application will be overseen by the ECJ.The Foreign Secretary’s objective has to be the undoing of this injustice and the full restoration of the sovereignty of the UK Parliament over the whole of the UK. If she has to implement the threat of acting unilaterally as she is entitled to do under the Withdrawal Agreement, then she must have the resolve to do so. There is too much at stake to do otherwise.She doesn’t need to be intransigent because there is a way in which the sovereignty and economic integrity of the UK can be protected while at the same time safeguarding the EU single market from the miniscule amount of trade which enters it through NI. The Mutual Enforcement proposals developed and put forward by the Centre for Brexit Policy, the workability of which have never been seriously challenged, should be the bedrock for a replacement of the NI Protocol.It doesn’t matter whether Liz Truss swings her handbag, fires a salvo from her tank or uses her considerable negotiating charms the important thing is that she does not leave these negotiations without undoing the damage which the NI Protocol has done to the UK and to the political stability in NI.Rt Hon Sammy Wilson MP is a Director at the Centre for Brexit PolicyMore from News‘Don’t hide your age with facelifts’: Jenny Agutter gets under the skin of ‘self-obsessed’ actorsSki holidays back on as France lifts UK Covid travel banWas the Russian flu a ‘coronavirus’?

Soon, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition were confined to their sickbeds and London hospitals were struggling to cope. The disease felled burly policemen and Bank of England clerks. At a wedding party attended by 100 guests, it was reported that all but three had fallen ill. You could be forgiven for thinking this is a description of the latest omicron strain of Covid-19. In fact, it details the severe wave of illness that swept London during the “Russian influenza” pandemic of the 1890s. The so-called influenza was blamed on Russia because the first reported outbreak occurred in St Petersburg in November 1889. But though some of the symptoms, such as fever, chills and aches, were consistent with flu, an increasing number of scientists believe the Russian flu may have actually been due to a bovine coronavirus.As with omicron, the majority of infections were mild. But approximately one in a hundred cases resulted in severe illness or death, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions. Many complained of “a hard, dry cough of a paroxysmal kind, worst at night”. Whereas influenza tends to be most fatal to infants and the elderly, with a graph of mortality by age tracing a U-shape, in the case of the Russian flu the mortality curve was J-shaped, reflecting the rising mortality in the over-60s. In other words, similar to Covid.Russian flu was also associated with inflammatory conditions and fatigue reminiscent of long Covid. Sir Morrell Mackenzie, a Victorian throat specialist, noted that the influenza had a propensity to “run up and down the nervous keyboard stirring up disorder and pain in different parts of the body with what almost seems malicious caprice”. Marked neurological symptoms included intense headaches and shooting pains, as well as a loss of taste and smell.Four million people in England and Wales were ill during the first wave in the winter of 1889-90, with a recorded 27,000 excess deaths from respiratory diseases. In spring 1891, there was a second, more severe wave, which accounted for nearly 58,000 excess deaths. The winter of 1892 saw a third wave, marked by a further 25,000 deaths. Taking into account a revival in 1893, and the fourth wave in 1895, it was estimated that at least 125,000 Britons had perished.The parallels are striking. So, if the Russian flu was caused by a coronavirus, what might that pandemic tell us about the likely evolution of Covid-19, and what can we learn from the Victorian experience of living with repeated waves in an era before vaccines and antiviral drugs?Intriguingly, the Russian flu was preceded by catastrophic outbreaks of a highly infectious respiratory disease in cattle. These led to repeated culling between 1870 and 1890, as farmers sought to prevent the contamination of milk supplies. In an era before refrigeration and pasteurisation, the only way to supply growing urban populations with fresh milk was by bringing cows to city centres – a plausible root for the interspecies transmission of BCoV, or the bovine coronavirus. Thanks to some nifty molecular detective work by Belgian virologist Dr Marc Van Ranst at Leuven University, we know this is closely related to the human coronavirus OC43 with which it shares a common ancestor in around 1890 – suggesting that this is when it probably first jumped from cattle to humans. The date coincides with the first reports of the Russian influenza. At a time when most medics subscribed to miasma theory – the idea that diseases were the result of poisonous exhalations from the earth carried on the wind – little consideration was given to social distancing or masks. Instead, doctors emphasised the importance of bed rest and a positive state of mind, lest fear become the “mother of infection”.The Lancet medical journal even went as far as to blame “dread of the epidemic” on the worldwide telegraphic network which, in 1889, had enabled Reuters correspondents to transmit news of the pandemic from St Petersburg well ahead of domestic outbreaks.Satirical magazine Punch warned: “If you sit all day in your great coat, muffled up to the eyes in a woollen comforter and with your feet in constantly replenished mustard and hot water, as you propose, you will certainly be prepared, when it makes its appearance, to encounter the attack of the Russian Epidemic Influenza, that you so much dread.”A good insight into how Victorians adjusted comes from English social reformer and women\u0027s rights campaigner, Josephine Butler, who suffered recurrent bouts of flu throughout the 1890s.In December 1891, Butler complained of  “a cough… and a good deal of weakness”. In January 1892, she told her son: “I don’t think I ever remember being so weak, not even after the malaria fever at Genoa.” Six months later, she suffered an attack of pneumonia and pleurisy, leaving her the use of just one good lung.  Embracing the miasmatic theories, Butler wrote that the Russian influenza had been conveyed to Britain on the “northeast winds”. This suggested that closing doors and shutting windows might be a safeguard. However, others were convinced the disease was contagious and that the best protection was ventilation and the disinfection of letters thought to harbour infectious particles.If the Russian flu was due to a coronavirus – and it is an “if” – the Victorian experience does not augur well for our present. Epidemiologists estimate that up to 60 per cent of the population was infected in the initial phase between 1889 and 1892. But herd immunity does not appear to have been reached, hence the recurrent waves of illness, marked by high mortality.“You don’t get herd immunity with coronaviruses,” says Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia. “When you combine that with the clinical evidence, the similarities between the Russian flu and Covid-19 are striking.” Indeed, Butler was still complaining of Russian influenza at the turn of the century. She was not alone. “Influenza has declined to move westward and become almost a regular Christmas annual,” complained one weary medical commentator in 1900. “A pair of blankets and a pillow, properly applied, still form a complete protection against 99 attacks out of a hundred. But in that hundredth case it will detect and advertise some latent flaw, add the last straw… with fiendish ingenuity and deadly effect.”Mark Honigsbaum is author of The Pandemic Century: A History of Global Contagion from the Spanish Flu to Covid-19 (Penguin, £16.99).

We should “wait for Sue Gray,” say government ministers when pressed about the Prime Minister’s notorious garden party. Lets “see what Sue Gray finds,” say Conservative backbenchers when asked if they’ve submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady calling for a vote of no confidence in Johnson’s leadership. Sue Gray, Sue Gray! It is the most striking incantation of a British woman’s name since Mrs Moore was given similar treatment by EM Forster in A Passage To India. But can the spirit of Ms Gray calm the febrile mood in Westminster, as the PM’s supporters hope, or will her report on partying at Downing Street prove to be the tipping point, with Boris Johnson the entity getting tipped?Historical precedence suggests that the findings of the Gray inquiry, expected within a fortnight, are unlikely to contain explicit condemnation of Johnson. That is just not what senior establishment figures do to sitting prime ministers when called on to assess their conduct. But neither are they particularly keen on becoming bywords for a whitewash. So we will probably be left scouring her conclusions for a memorable piece of indirect criticism, a withering phrase that will echo down the ages.That alone does not end Johnson\u0027s problems, however. His latest poll ratings are verging on levels last experienced by the Tories in the latter Theresa May era and he has brought most of it on himself.What looks increasingly like a fatal character flaw was spotted way back in his school days by Martin Hammond, Johnson’s housemaster and classics teacher at Eton. “I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else,” wrote Hammond in a letter to Johnson’s father Stanley in April 1982.For most of his life, Johnson got away with that cavalier approach, deploying charm and charisma to grant himself licence to behave differently from lesser mortals. But leading the country at a time when huge sacrifices were being demanded of the British public has tested that approach to destruction. The country’s chief rule-maker can hardly be a major rule-breaker too, not when lives are at stake. The muted responses of the Conservative benches at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday was telling. Still, there are glimmers of hope for him. The Covid data is continuing to improve and much of the country may eventually credit him with having got the big decisions right over the past 12 months, even if they are not in the mood for doing so at the moment. He oversaw the fastest vaccination programme in Europe, successfully unlocked the country in July, accelerated boosters in the autumn and refused to lockdown again in the face of the omicron wave in December (with the aid of his backbenchers and Cabinet minister). The biggest challenge looking ahead is the cost of living crisis, which will lead to even more resentment towards a government that is raising taxes and refusing to extract energy domestically, so good news on Covid is unlikely to suffice.Johnson can reasonably rely on Sue Gray’s report not pointing the finger directly at him. But he cannot be sure — especially if Labour maintains a lead in the polls — that his party won’t turn on him before the next general election.Join our webinar and chat to  journalists about Boris Johnson\u0027s leadership tomorrow Friday January 14 at middayMore from News‘Don’t hide your age with facelifts’: Jenny Agutter gets under the skin of ‘self-obsessed’ actorsSki holidays back on as France lifts UK Covid travel banWas the Russian flu a ‘coronavirus’?

If he were to resign, hed be joining a long list of British political leaders who have fallen on their swordBoris Johnson is being called on to resign Image: PAByHarry Thompson:,  Jan | comments Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under enormous pressure to resign following his admission that he had spent  minutes at a garden party at Downing Street, during the first lockdown, in May, .He is also under threat of falling to a vote of no confidencehis party backbenchers trigger one. This, in turn, could see the beginning of a whole Tory leadership election. Scandals surrounding the breach of Covid regulation have already seen high-profile members of Johnsonaposs entourage leaving their roles.Then Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, resigned in June, , after he was found to have broken social distancing laws when he kissed his aide. At the time, Johnson said he was sorry to receive the resignation. In December, , Johnsonaposs aide, Allegra Stratton, also resigned after footage emerged of her laughing when preparing a response for the media about an alleged Christmas party.On both occasions, the Prime Minister accepted their resignations but has not yet done so when it has been asked of him. Do Prime Ministers resign often   The short answer, recently, is yes. In fact, all three of Johnsonaposs most immediate predecessors, who were elected in the st century, have left their posts at the head of government through resignation. Read on to find out why they did. Theresa MayJohnsonaposs direct predecessor, Theresa May, announced her resignation on May , , following repeated attempts to get her Brexit withdrawal deal passed through parliament.She had met stf resistance from MPs time and time again as she attempted to get her plans through. Eventually, she admitted defeat and stood down, her deal having been defeated three times. At the time, she said: It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort. David Cameron Another victim of Brexit, David Cameron resigned on June , , only hours after the UK decided to leave the EU.Cameron had fought his election on the promise of the vote but personally campaigned in favour of remaining in the union. However, within hours of the % majority vote in favour of leaving, he tendered his resignation and would be gone by the end of October that year. Due to his personal preference for remaining in the EU, he said: I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination. Gordon Brown Gordon Brown fought in the May , , general election, however, the close race resulted in a hung parliament. By May , , Brown announced he would be standing down as leader of the Labour party. He tendered his resignation to the Queen and, in doing so, encouraged her to ask David Cameron to form a government.At the time, he said it had been a privilege and wished his successor well. He said: Above all, it was a privilege to serve and, yes, I love the job, not for its prestige, its titles and ceremony, which I do not love at all. No, I loved the job for its potential to make this country I love fairer, more tolerant, more green, more democratic, more prosperous and more just - truly a greater Britain.

The Commons Standards Commissioner found Daniel Kawczynski had caused signicant damage to the reputation of the Commons as a whole, and undermined the Independent Complaints and Grievance Schemewith comments made to the media, including the Daily Mirror. And in a scathing report, the cross-party Standards Committee, which recommends sanctions following the Commissioner’s investigations, accused Mr Kawczynski of “struggling with a capacity for genuine empathy with others.” Mr Kawczynski spoke to the Mirror following the publication of a previous report into his behaviour, which found he had had acted in a “threatening and intimidating manner” towards workers after a tech glitch meant he was unable to join a committee hearing. He was ordered to make an apology on the floor of the House. But the Standards Commissioner launched a second probe after Mr Kawczynski told the Mirror making the apology was something Iaposm going to have to do and he would use the script he had been provided. He also admitted he had had one large glass of wine before making the phone call, but denied being drunk. The Commissioner’s report, published today, found Mr Kawczynski had failed to comply with the required sanction, which recommended an “unequivocal” apology. The Commissioner also found Mr Kawczynski had broken confidentiality requirements by making comments to BBC Radio Shropshire which could have identied the staff members who complained.The Committee’s scathing report found Mr Kawczynski had been “slow to develop insight into how his remarks …would have impacted personally on the two original complainants.” It went on: “The Committee notes that even in his most recent comments, Mr Kawczynski has focussed very much on his own personal journey rather than on the damage he may have caused to others. “The Committee feels that Mr Kawczynski has an intellectual understanding that he has damaged the ICGS system, but is still struggling with a capacity for genuine empathy with others, and as a result still has a tendency, which he may not fully realise, to see himself rather than others as the victim in what has happened.” But the Committee accepted that the Shrewsbury MP had been on a “journey” towards better self-knowledge. And they said his comments had been, in part, “triggered” by his belief that the sensitive details of the original  investigation into his behaviour had been leaked. The Committee warned that ordinarily Mr Kawczynski’s behaviour would warrant a “substantial” suspension from the House. But after paying “particular regard to the mitigating circumstances adduced by Mr Kawczynski”, including his commitment to “undertake further work on his behaviour”, they recommended a one-day suspension and a further apology to the House.

And it will be his downfall, because he can’t help repeating the lie. He still thinks the illegal May rave in the No garden was a “work event”. He told MPs he had “taken one for the team” implying that he had done nothing wrong. He can’t face the real truth, that he broke the rules he imposed on others, because he is a congenital liar. For him, the lie becomes the truth. And when you believe your own lies, you’ve had it.I doubt that the forthcoming Partygate report by civil servant Sue Gray will add much to the sum of our knowledge. It might not be a classic Whitehall whitewash, but it could be a damp squib.Asking the head prefect to cane the headmaster is laughably naive. So where do we go from here  There are electoral tests to come. A parliamentary by-election in Erdington, Birmingham, and council polls in May. If Boris Johnson manages to cling to power until then, voters should so ­humiliate him in the ballot box that the Tories have no choice but to dump him.

So he decided to start getting healthy - and had an unusual way of achieving his goalMatt has lost an incredible  stone Image: Matt PenzerByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsAs Matt Penzer donned his work unorm and looked at his reflection, he was unhappy with what he saw. “I looked in the mirror and pushed my love handles up, and thought ‘What would I look likeI didn’t have these’ ,” Matt, , told The Mirror. Always being fairly slim as a teenager, Matt reckons he started to pile on the pounds after marrying his husband Brett in . “It wasn’t his fault or anything, but I just got comfortable and I became less mobile. I’d always been quite active at school and in college, but I just got lazy,” he recalled. After getting married, Matt lived with Brett and his mum and was out of work for a while. During this time, he says his weight started to balloon. “I’d get up and have glasses of coke and fizzy drinks. I love Kettle Chips and wouldn’t really have a proper breakfast. I’d just eat a whole bag and not really think about the calories.

This was all before dinner! “Then for dinner I’d have a large meal with chips and mayonnaise. Maybe pizza or a takeaway.” Over the course of a day, Matt, from Birmingham, estimates he ate between , and , calories - without really thinking about the nutritional content of his food. Towards the end of , however, he decided it was time to make a change. Now working in security, he hated how he looked in his unorm and knew he had to start eating more healthily. So as the clock struck midnight on  January , and weighing st lbs, he vowed to eat better and get active. “I thought, ‘This is it, I’m going to do it’. I had my belly hanging out and thought, ‘I don’t want to be like this forever’. “I went in % and knew I needed to change something, no excuses.” Instead of following a particular diet plan, Matt swapped his old go-to meals for healthier alternatives.  He said: “I cut out bread and started researching foods that were bad for you - some of them came as a surprise. “I stopped eating crisps and biscuits and drinking fizzy pop. If I wanted a sandwich for lunch, I’d swap out bread for rice cakes. For breakfast, I’d have an apple and a banana.” He also cooked all his food in low-calorie alternatives to oil, which he still uses to this day. Matt also tracked his daily calories using MyFitnessPal to keep on top of how much he was eating. By March , Matt had already lost two stone and was over the moon with his progress. But when lockdown hit, he was terried he’d slip back into old habits. “I worked for a week before I got put on furlough and I was so scared I’d go back to how I used to be, and maybe even put on more weight,” he said.  With gyms closed and admitting he’s never been the type of person to go for a run, Matt worried about how he’d stay active. But a purchase he and Brett had made before Christmas proved to be his saving grace - the Nintendo Switch games console. The pair had bought a Ring Fit Adventure game for the console, which gets people moving while they play. “I’d get up six days a week and go on the Ring Fit for an hour. I made sure I did it every morning, with one day off,” Matt said. “It was great entertainment as well as a good fitness game. It really helped me to lose weight because it was tough and actually tired me out.” After three months of a strict lockdown, with little  to do other than play Ring Fit Adventure, the weight had fallen off Matt. And he realised just how much progress he’d made when he saw his mum for the first time as lockdown eased. “She said she saw me walking up the street and didn’t know it was me at first. She was amazed, it took her a minute to register such a massive change in such a short period of time,” he recalled. As he met up with more family and friends he hadn’t seen for months, Matt was showered with compliments over his appearance. By the end of July, he’d reached his goal weight of st lbs and was so pleased with the progress he’d made. Eighteen months on, Matt has maintained his goal weight with healthy eating habits - but he admits he’s barely used the Ring Fit since. “My job is quite active and I do a lot of walking and lting, so I have exercise in my everyday le,” he said.Have you had an incredible body transformation  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcLooking back on his incredible weight loss, Matt says anyone  can achieve the samethey are motivated enough - eventhey don’t have all the tools.

Vowing never to blend into the background again, she decided sheaposd aim to look like a Barbie - which brought her more attention. She said: “I was not confident growing up at all. I had a job in Sainsbury’s for five years and people still thought I was the new person. “I was really quiet in school, I used to be pale and have black hair. I was even kind of emo-looking and then I realised it wasn’t me.”  When she was , Scarlett first experimented with lip filler - and had top ups every month. Then, at  years old, she went under the kne for the first time to have a breast enhancement - taking her from a E to a H - a procedure that cost £,.

They all think I’m crazy for it and they’ve told me not to have any more surgeries but I’m already thinking about a third round.” Her overall goal is to look like Kim Kardashian, but she also takes inspiration from former Geordie Shore star Chloe Ferryaposs body shape.

Scarlett revealed: “My mum drove me to work and back everyday and I had to lay across the back seat. Then in the office, I stood at my desk all day. “I even had to do my eyelash clients while standing up. But I want a third BBL because I feel like my bum could still be bigger and I fell in love with the shape I achieved at post-op. “You lose up to % of the fat put in as it doesn’t all survive so I’m looking to achieve that look again!”Scarlett, who is on Instagram @Scarlettgladwin, hasnapost ruled out more cosmetic surgery in future, with her sights set on another nose job, bigger boobs and fox eye surgery, which pulls the eyes upwards.She admits her love of plastic surgery is like an addiction - and trying something new gives her a buzz.

The chocolate four-year-old Jack Russell cross works hard on her family-run farm in County Kilkenny, Ireland, and helps to herd flocks of sheep and alpacas. In the footage, Inca’s owner and regenerative farmer, Suzanna Crampton, is behind the camera, scattering pellets for the sheep before letting them out of their field. At  seconds, tiny Inca makes her first appearance, barking and running in and out of the flock. When Suzanna begins calling for the sheep to move towards the orchard, Inca steps up to her sheepdog role and scampers behind them, barking loudly.  The energetic Jack Russell leaps across the grass and runs back and forth as the sheep walk ahead. One brown sheep refuses to move and tries to continue feeding, but Inca doesn’t have time for slackers - she barks in the sheep’s face and jumps until it follows orders. As the flock move towards the orchard, Inca makes sure they are behaving and runs between them. Suzanna calls: “Inca, job done!” but Inca persists to finish the job and follows the sheep ahead. Throughout the nine-minute video, Suzanna and Inca work as a team to herd the dferent flocks of sheep.Thevideois captioned ‘The World’s Smallest Sheepdog, Inca herds flock up to orchard’ and has been viewed by more than , people. One supporter commented: “Your tiny helper is shockingly adorable! Itaposs wonderful that she has a job.” Another said: “Beautul breed. Got some good help there.”The YouTube video is one of , onZwartbles Ireland’s channel- many of which feature tiny Inca demonstrating who’s boss.Owner Suzanna welcomed Inca into her home on the family-run farm when she was a puppy in July . At  months old, Inca began displaying a natural instinct to herd the lambs on the farm. “It was lambing season and Inca started to go out into the field and round them up,” Suzanna explained. “She would herd sheep, but not like a typical border collie - more like a New Zealand Huntaway, herding the lambs away from me towards their destination.”  Though Inca is “as small as the head of a Huntaway”, she became a “great help” on the farm. Now, Inca is one of five dogs in total and lives alongside German shepherd She Wolf, crossbreed Bear, border collie Pepper, and Inca’s own daughter Maya. Inca is the only sheepdog, though Maya does try to follow in her mother’s pawprints and assist. “When it’s lambing season, Inca is very good at helping out,” Suzanna said. “Lambs can be dficult to move, but Inca isn’t afraid to bark and tell them where to go. “Over time, I have taught Inca how to do things my way, and now she follows my commands. “If all the sheep are moving, Inca will glance at me to check they’re doing the right thing.”  Inca helps to herd  sheep on the farm, and also herds the alpacas. “She’s very good at dodging their kicks,” Suzanna said. Suzanna describes Inca as “intelligent and tenacious” and said she “loves to please”. When Inca isn’t getting down and dirty with the sheep and alpacas outdoors, she enjoys being pampered inside. “My cat Ovenmitt loves giving Inca baths,” Suzanna said.In oneYouTube video , you can see Ovenmitt licking Inca’s head clean.The County Kilkenny farm has been in Suzanna’s family since the early s, and she now raises her flock of Zwartbles sheep along the banks of the River Nore. “We are one of the first organic farms here in Ireland,” she said.  Suzanna is a huge advocate for regenerative farming and is passionate about improving soil ersity. And of course, her sidekick Inca likes to join in too. Suzanna and Inca teach other farmers about the importance of dung beetles. “Whenever I’m giving a demonstration, Inca will dig up the dung beetles to show people,” Suzanna said.

The teenager underwent successful chemotherapy and was given the all-clear by doctors when she was . Mike, now , and his we, , vowed to raise money for le-saving research to find a cure. And the couple, from Newport, South Wales, have stuck to their promise for  years - raising £,.The devoted pair have spent the past four decades working tirelessly to raise cash for Cancer Research. Retired architect Mike said the mission started after a family chat on their way home from London. He said: “My youngest daughter was affected by cancer. She was still in school and had wonderful treatment in London. “We were on the way back after her final surgery and chemotherapy and she said, ‘Mum, I’m one of the lucky ones. I’d like to give something back. This got us thinking.” The couple have raised thousands through supermarket collections, breakfast mornings, golf events and raffles. It became their full-time job after Mike retired  years ago. “It makes you feel you’ve done something positive and it’s given me a purpose,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed it because I think I’m doing something useful with my le. It’s like having a job without getting paid for it.”  Mike discovered a love of making marmalade and has sold over , jars - all for charity. They are now hoping to raise the final £, by July - after the pandemic saw donations dry up.

Well, I made it to  but we still haven’t hit the £m. “Although over the last two years we have had the pandemic to worry us, all cancer is going to be there after the pandemic has gone.”  Mike, who was awarded an MBE in  for his services to Cancer Research, added: “It will just be the icing on the cake to reach £m.” His we Bridget, a former local newspaper journalist, said: “I think it’s in my blood to raise money. “Even as a small child during the war I used to do a collection and was given a reward for raising more than the other girls.” The couple have three daughters and six grandchildren. Daughter Sally Kay, now , said: “The reach of the fundraiser has been amazing. Just last week we had donations from the Netherlands. “It’s incredible to see. We get lovely messages from strangers.” Sophie Busson, from Cancer Research, said: “What Mike and his family have achieved is phenomenal. “Mike’s dedication will enable scientists to find new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer and we’re incredibly grateful to him. “One in two of us will get cancer in our letime. “It’s thanks to people like Mike that we’ll be a step closer to helping more people survive the disease. “Mike is an inspiration and we would love for him to reach his fundraising target.

The mum-of-six raised concerns about the military-style rules at Outwood Academy Ormesby in Middlesbrough and said they were being compared to a Nazi salute.She said Tilly was one of seven pupils taken into the library on Thursday morning after refusing to raise their hand while lining up to go into the building, reports Teesside Live. The school said four pupils have been suspended - but not just for refusing to raise their hand. Executive principal Mark Hassack has has described Samanthaaposs claims as utterly ludicrous and nonsense.  Samantha, who is also mum to to an adult daughter, Thomas, six, and two-year-old twins Oscar and Wilson, said: Yesterday Tilly didnapost raised her hand but due to the hype of it they must have let it go. But today they have come back with a vengeance. I felt mixed emotions because I donapost want her getting into trouble. Iaposm annoyed that the kids havenapost got a voice. Theyaposre not little kids no more, theyaposve got feelings. They should be given respect. Samantha told Teesside Live earlier this week that her children were unhappy with the lining up method. The full-time mum said: They are not happy, they have even said kids are shouting aposHeil Hitler!apos when they are doing it. Itaposs like a military camp - itaposs like a salute. Why are the kids having to raise their hand  I feel they are being turned into performing monkeys. What are they going to do next  Rub their tummy when theyaposre hungry  Itaposs an unnecessary action. Samantha said Tilly refused to raise her hand on Thursday morning and was taken into the library with six others, where she also failed to hand over her mobile phone. She said her daughter has been suspended from the school until Monday and will be taught over Google Classroom.Samantha, who has got a meeting with the school on Monday, said: I have told Tilly that she shouldnapost have had her mobile with her. Itaposs a shame they are getting backed into something and they have no voice. Theyaposre not allowed to speak or have an opinion. Sheaposs got a voice, she still hasnapost been able to voice her opinion. Kids are our future. If you canapost back your child for believing in something and standing their ground then you have got problems yourself. Mr Hassack has now hit back at the comments made about the schools lining up method, which have been shared on social media. He said: This whole situation is utterly ludicrous and stems from a parentaposs social media post in which she compares school children lining up to Nazi Germany. This is incredibly dangerous, insulting, offensive and frankly rude. Our staff and children work incredibly hard and I’m not going to allow an unintelligent social media post to affect all of the good work going on at Outwood Academy Ormesby.  This parent clearly wants us to lower standards in school - which weaposre not going to do. In relation to the suspensions, he said seven pupils were taken into the library, after failing to put their hand up during lining up, so that they could receive an intervention from a member of staff. Mr Hassack said four of them were suspended, but this was not just for failing to put their hand up. He said: We would never suspend a child solely for not lining up and whilst I can’t comment on specic cases, I will say is that a school it’s sometimes necessary to use suspension as a final resort to ensure that schools remain safe, orderly and calm so that all children can have a good experience of school. Children may be suspended as a last resort for ious reasons. It could be that a child has refused a number of reasonable instructions.  Mark said that lining up is a standard operating strategy of a school and is not a new method which has been introduced. He added: Iaposm surprised that it’s even news that children line up in a school and children put their hand up in a school. Children putting their hand up is not new. The only thing slightly dferent is the location in the school where students are doing it. It is just a standard operating strategy of a school. It doesnapost just happen in Outwood schools, it happens in lots of dferent schools. I think anybody who comes into our school can see that children are respected by adults and vice-versa and this very clear when you walk around any of our schools. “For children who have additional needs, we always ensure reasonable adjustments are in place and for any children who find it dficult to meet our expectations, we provide a wealth of support to enable them to do so. What we won’t do is lower our standards but we will do everything we can to help all children to meet them. I would say the relationship between adults and children in this school is particularly strong. Everyone in education is dealing with incredibly challenging circumstances in the midst of a pandemic. We just need to get on with educating children and not be distracted by this nonsense. We would always listen to the voices of parents and children but some parents must understand that this does not always mean that they will get their own way.

Little Arianna Solieri was told she has a rare and aggressive form of the disease after complaining about a pain in her back. Parents, Chris Solieri,  and Abigail Solieri, , said it was the most devastating week of our lives” when their daughter was diagnosed. Since then, Arianna has received six rounds of chemotherapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and is an inspiration to her little sisters Mya, three, and Zara, one. Her dad said that while Mya does not understand the extent of her sister’s condition, she always offers a helping hand. Mr Solieri, from Ware, Hertfordshire, said: “One day when Arianna was sick, Mya just jumped up and brought her a bowl because she has seen me and her mum do it. “She loves her sister and she looks up to her. “She always wants to be around her but when Arianna is not here, her best friend is missing. Ariannaaposs parents initially assumed her pain was caused by a new bed in July last year. But after eight trips to AE and a scan, they were told the heartbreaking news that she had stage  high risk neuroblastoma. “Arianna was complaining about a pain near her shoulder blades but we just assumed it was muscular after just buying her a new bed, Mr Solieri said. After seeing an Osteopath the pain subsided. “However in November, the pain shted to her lower back pain and it was clear something was very wrong.” Overnight, the pain had become so agonising for little Arianna and her temperature had spiked to  degrees. As doctors prescribed antibiotics for a possible kidney infection Arianna’s mum felt that something was not right and her maternal instinct kicked in. She took Arianna back to the GP as well as AE eight times in six days until the doctors confirmed her diagnosis. Mr Solieri said: “In AE they’re always busy and we were initially told it would be a seven hour wait to see a doctor but my we insisted further tests were done. “After an ultrasound on her kidney, the radiologist asked for his colleague and my heart sunk. I knew it wasn’t going to be good news. Doctors found a tumour above Ariannaaposs left kidney and she was sent to Great Ormand Street two days later which led to her final diagnosis. Neuroblastoma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer which affects around  children a year in the UK, according to the NHS website. Mr Solieri added: “With this type of diagnosis, we were given a  to  per cent chance of survival with a  per cent chance of relapse. “In a week, we found out our daughter had cancer, her survival rate had now dropped, and she would now have to go under an aggressive treatment plan. As the determined little girl undergoes her treatment, Arianna is also excited for the arrival of her new sister who is due around her sixth birthday in March. The five-year-old is currently going through an intensive treatment plan including cycles of chemotherapy every ten days. A GoFundMe has been set up for Arianna as it is likely that she will need further, non-NHS funded treatment in America. Her father said: “We have high hopes that Arianna will get through this, and she will have no evidence of disease and at that point there is the bivalent vaccine that reduces the risk of it coming back. Although it is too early in Ariannaaposs treatment plan to sign up, her parents are looking to raise funds immediately as they need the equivalent of £, for the procedure in New York. “Any money raised that isn’t used for Arianna’s care we would like to donate to another family in a similar situation or to the ious charities that have helped them along the way,” Mr Solieri said. Arianna continues to laugh and smile and her love of superhero costumes, especially Wonder Woman which has given her the strength and confidence on the days when this has been incredibly scary. Her dad said: “She really is a gt she is perfect in every way. It is horrendous something like this can happen to someone with such a good heart.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSGreat Ormond Street HospitalWonder WomanHospitalsLoveBack painCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The noise could be a low-pitched humming, a buzzing, a high-pitch whistle or a hissing. According to estimates from the International Journal of Audiology, as many as one in six iniduals with Covid had tinnitus, most often during the early stages of the virus, reports Devon Live. The NHS lists tinnitus as one of the symptoms of long Covid - also known as post-Covid syndrome. Below, Katie Ogden, the HCPC registered hearing aid dispenser and Training Manager forReSoundNorth-West Europe offers some expert advice on tinnitus. There is also a list of long-Covid symptoms from the NHS  How to tellyou’re suffering from tinnitus  There is no set rule about what that sound will be with the following being the most common:A low pitch humming sound A high pitch whistle Buzzing Clicking Hissing Throbbing Music  How can it impact everyday le  Tinnitus can be very distracting and prevent people from being able to concentrate which in turn is very frustrating, it is often associated with insomnia and can contribute to issues with mental health such as anxiety, stress and depression. The vicious cycle The dficulty is that tinnitus can become part of a vicious cycle, in its most basic form of this cycle, stress feeds off of tinnitus and tinnitus feeds off of stress so the key to successfully managing tinnitus is to find the method s that breaks the cycle for the person that is struggling to cope with tinnitus.  What causes tinnitus  There is no clear cause for tinnitus only theories of possibilities, this is why there is no cure. Remember this is a sound that no one  can hear, which means no one  can proveit is even happening, nor can anyone prove it isn’t happening. This makes tinnitus an incredibly complex condition but also a very unique condition to the person who is trying to live with it. There are however some thoughts around possible causes relating to hearing loss:Trauma to the head, neck and ears Infections Wax build-ups Stress and anxiety Nerve damage and other neurological disorders Treatments and medicationOn the other hand, tinnitus can often occur or start for absolutely no reason at all. How to manage and cope with tinnitus While there is no cure, there are many methods, tactics and strategies that can enable a sufferer to successfully manage their condition. These include:Cognitive Behavioural TherapiesMindfulness Meditation Reducing stress Relaxation therapies Tinnitus Retraining TherapiesHearing AidsWhere to get help  In the UK, there are many regional tinnitus support groups where you can go and meet others to discuss further management techniques or even just talk about your experiences with others in a similar situation, which can be a huge help.You can also contact your GP or a hearing care professional for further information. UK audiologists can be found and contacted through the ReSound website. Alternatively, you can go to the British Tinnitus Association website at https:www.tinnitus.org.uk  for even more information about tinnitus and available support. If you are experiencing symptoms of stress, anxiety or depression and want to talk to someone there are many people waiting to listen to you right now call the Samaritans on   or text SHOUT to  or go to https:www.samaritans.org  to live chat. NHS on long CovidHow long it takes to recover from Covid- is dferent for everybody.Many people feel better in a few days or weeks and most will make a full recovery within  weeks. But for some people, symptoms can last longer. The chances of having long-term symptoms does not seem to be linked to how ill you are when you first get Covid-. People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems. Symptoms of long COVID There are lots of symptoms you can have after a Covid- infection. Common long Covid symptoms include:extreme tirednessshortness of breath chest pain or tightness problems with memory and concentrationdficulty sleepingheart palpitations dizziness pins and needles joint pain depression and anxiety tinnitus, earaches feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste rashesRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSMental healthInsomniaCoronavirusLong Covid\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid has slashed the number of days people will need to isolate, with the new Covid rules set to come into effect from Monday January .The news was announced as Javid updated Parliament on the governmentaposs plans.On Wednesday January , Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced that a decision would be made on the matter as fast as possible. At Prime Minister Questions, Johnson had said: “We are certainly looking at reducing the isolation period, and we hope to bring you more about that ... as fast as possible.”The new comes just days after asymptomatic people were told they no longer needed to get a PCR test after ing a positive lateral flow.How long do I need to self-isolate under the new Covid rules   Under the new rules, people now need to isolate for just five full days, meaning thatthey have tested negative twice they can exit on day six from the day their isolation began. People must have tested negative on both days five and six. The move brings the UK in line with guidance in the USA, where people already only need to isolate for five days. When calculating your isolation period, a full day is counted as starting at : am on the next calendar day from the day you tested positive. This means people will be isolating for somewhere between five and six days - this will be dependent on when their symptoms started or they received confirmation of a positive test. If you still test positive after days five and six, you will need to continue to isolate until youtwo negative tests on two consecutive days. The two negative tests must be reported before peopleto work and educationthey want to leave before the full -day period is completed.People leaving isolation on day six after Monday  are being firmly encouraged to wear a face covering and limit close contact with other people.Mr Javid said: “These two tests are critical to these balanced and proportionate plans and I’d urge everyone to take advantage of the capacity we’ve built up in tests so we can restore more freedom to this country, whilst we are keeping everyone safe.”  WhatIaposm a close contact If you are a close contact you may also need to self-isolate. For example,someone you live with tests positive you will need to do so, unless you are exempt.Exemptions in this scenario include being fully vaccinated, having received a final jab no less than  days before coming into contact with the virus. This also appliesyou are a close contact of someone with the virus. Under-s are also exemptthey are a close contact, as are people unable to take vaccinations for medical reasons.But evenyou are exempt from isolation, the NHS strongly recommends that you take a lateral flow test every day for seven days and consider limiting contact with others where possible.What were the rules before  Until Monday, guidance states people need to isolate for six full days from the point they developed symptoms or tested positive for Covid-.This means people are currently free to leave isolation partway through the seventh day. The change in rules is the second of its kind - previously people had to isolate for the full  days regardless of whether they were testing negative in the late stage of their time at home. The new rules will come into play at .am on Monday morning. Why have the self-isolation Covid rules been changed again  The change has been forced from an NHS staffing crisis and huge pressure from Tory MPs.Mr Javid said the move would maximise activity in the economy and education. He also said: UK Health Security Agency data shows around two-thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of day five.The changes were announced amid a heated parliamentary session, where the Labour Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the Prime Minister is not fit to lick the boots of NHS staff in this country.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Omicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On January , , the pair said they were leaving The Firm to seek privacy – and their fortune – where.The shock announcement is said to have blindsided the royals, as they revealed they planned to split their time between the UK and North America and would carve out a progression new role in the institution while becoming financially independent.Days later on January  - exactly two years ago today - unprecedented crunch talks were held in what became known as the Sandringham Summit between Harry, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William. Here we look back at exactly what happened during that emergency meeting... What was the Sandringham Summit  Meghan and Harryaposs statement days earlier that they were stepping down as senior royals is said to have come as a surprise to the Queen. In the days that followed, the Queen and her heirs, Princes Charles and William, ordered a series of crisis talks to deal with the wantaway couple, forcing Harry to a Sandringham Summit at the royals’ Norfolk estate. Meghan did not take part in the talks. Gathering in the Long Library of the family’s th century Sandringham estate, the royals looked each other in the eye and agreed to find a resolution.What happened at the Sandringham Summit  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Chairing the meeting, across a large polished table with room for eight chairs, the Queen and her family set out their vision of how a new version of monarchy would emerge. Among the topics discussed are thought to have been titles, finances and security. The emergency meeting ended with the Queen reluctantly granting her grandson and his we permission to step down as senior royals. Agreements were put in place alongside a -month review of the thrashed-out agreement, in which they promised to “continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty” while getting their independence.However, one book claims that William refused to eat with Prince Harry at a summit - leaving him to dine alone with the Queen.According to Robert Laceyaposs book Battle of Brothers, William was distraught after Harry and Meghan announced they wanted to step down as senior members of the Royal Family with a statement on social media.  Lacey wrote: The Queen had suggested the family should gather for lunch before their big pow-wow in the library that afternoon, but he refused his grandmother’s invitation. He would obviously turn up at pm for the meeting, he said, but he only wanted to talk business. The Prince himself has not confirmed his friends’ speculation that he was so furious with his younger brother that he would not be able to endure the hypocrisy of smiling at him over lunch. Summit statement  Following the summit, a statement from the Queen said the groups had “constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family”. It added: “My family and I are entirely supportive of their desire to create a new le. “Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le while remaining a valued part of my family.” Two years on  Now two years on from the summit, a lot has changed for Harry and Meghan.Theyaposve now settled in Calornia, signed several big-money deals with the likes of Netflix and Spoty, given a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey and welcomed a daughter called Lilibet.In their Oprah interview, they made a series of shocking and controversial claims about their time as senior royals.  Meghan claimed she had been refused mental health treatment after revealing to palace staff that she was struggling with suicidal thoughts while she was pregnant with their son Archie. The couple also claimed that questions had been asked about what colour Archieaposs skin would be. Harry accused his dad of cutting him off financially and claimed he had stopped taking his calls.  Last month, it was reported that Harry and Charles had barely spoken in eight months, with their relationship at an all-time low.Meanwhile, Harry also reportedly continues to have a frosty relationship with brother William. According to friends, after the Oprah interview, William was left feeling very upset and reeling over the claims, with his head all over the place.And a source has now told the Sunday Times that he was still furious several months later and didnapost want to attend the Diana statue unveiling with his brother, who jetted in from Calornia for the event last July.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The  months since have been dficult for the royals, with tell-all interviews, racism claims and sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew - which he strongly denies. They also said goodbye to the Queenaposs strength and stay, Prince Philip.Royal expert Robert Jobson believes that even now, the family are still feeing the impact of the hole left by the Sussexes, especially since Andrew was forced to step down. He tells the Mirror: Two years on front the Sandringham summit the dust has settled over Harry and Meghan’s decision to quit as full time royals.  So much has changed, but one thing is certain - the Sussexes’ departure has left the Monarchy in a worse position. Why  Because they were international stars, who shone a light on Britain and what is good about our country, our ersity and our humour. What followed were accusations of racism aimed at the royal family by the couple and more bitter recriminations. I travelled with the couple on the tours they did before they decided to abandon their jobs. As a country we benefitted from the afterglow as they toured Fiji, Tonga, Australia, and Morocco. And before Meghan, Harry was regarded as the most popular royal, whose work with AIDS and helping ex service personnel much lauded. The bitterness that emerged during the South Africa tour and the legal wrangling that followed - only led them to a series of legal spats with then media, and inevitably attacks from both sides. The once cool couple, who were seen as energetic, youthful and fun, suddenly became pariahs. But I fear the monarchy, as we approach the soon-to-be -year-old Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, appears a tired institution, dated, in need of renovation, an uplt. Since the start of the pandemic weaposve seen the Queen step back from some of her duties, firstly due to lockdown restrictions and then for medical reasons. With Charles and Camilla also deemed high risk due to their age, it fell to the younger royals to keep things going over - with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie Wessex and Prince Edward taking centre stage.  Robert explains: We sadly lost the patriarch Prince Philip last April and since then the Queen has scaled back her engagements. Prince Charles continues with his gruelling schedule at home and abroad, ably supported by his future Queen Consort Camilla. When he was snapped almost falling asleep as the Queen’s representative at the handover of Barbados who could blame him  He was jet lagged and exhausted. At , nobody can question his work ethic. He is totally committed to Crown and duty and is taking a lead role. But he is only human. There had been talk that Charles was planning a cull of lesser royals and wanted to streamline The Firm when he is king. His thinking behind such a move was to make the institution more cost effective and perceived to be more efficient. Such a cull is no longer really needed with Harry and Meghan’s self-imposed exile and The Duke of York’s enforced absence from royal le due to ongoing sex case. With a civil case against him brought by trafficked Virginia Roberts - now Mrs Giuffre - who accuses him of having sex with her three times whilst under the age of . That means he is no longer seen as a working member of the royal family and ato public le of the -year Duke, is extremely unlikely. So the streamlining has happened naturally. It means going forward, that the pressure will increasingly on the Charles and Camilla But long term it will be William and his we, Catherine, who will carry the heavy burden of making the Crown relevant. This year promises to be especially dficult for the queen.  Yes, she will be the focus of national celebration as we commemorate her  years on the throne this summer in public, and she will do so privately on  February, the anniversary of her father’s death. But this year she will no longer have Philip. Her strength and stay for so many years throughout her long and celebrated reign, he was always her wisest of counsel. The Queen now relies more and more heavily upon her son Prince Charles and a grandson, Prince William to steer the ship of monarchy in the right direction. Whether the departure of Harry and Megan and the enforced retirement of Prince Andrew has seriously damaged the royal family only time will tell. But it seems that the monarchy is less stable than it once was. Already Barbados became a republic, ditching the Queen after all her years of service as Head of State. Other former colonies may follow, including Jamaica, where there has been a push towards a Republic. Only time will tell whether Australia, New Zealand and Canada will follow when Charles becomes Kong. For William and Catherine, however, the shining star stars of the monarchy, there is no respite. With Meghan and Harry out of the picture, the spotlight is on them and the extra workload too.

Pupils at Bishop Heber in Malpas, Cheshire, can only wear a costly branded school jacket on school grounds. Photos taken by furious parents show staff milling around outside in warm overcoats while some children are just in jumpers, Cheshire Live reports.One mum said her asthmatic son was put into isolation for retrieving his confiscated coat because he was cold. The school says it believeschildren were allowed to wear their own coats, it would erode the great relationships we have with the students, because they might end up wearing hoodies. The schoolaposs policies have been slammed by Cheshire MP Mike Amesbury, who is currently pushing a Bill to make sure parents are not being saddled with hefty bills for branded unorms.Do you agree with the schoolaposs unorm policy  Have your say in the comments section below Parents have also complained about the cost and quality of the branded windcheater which costs £. One parent who has bought the branded school anorak said it was not sufficient to keep her children warm. She said: They would literally have to have a branded polo, branded sweater, branded fleece and branded anorak in order to be warm and dry outside. Given Mike Amesburyaposs law, that is extremely excessive branding - and Iaposve never heard of another school having a branded outside coat before now. Those four items would set parents back by £., ignoring the need for multiple purchases sensible for some items. An angry mum added: “They confiscated his [my sonaposs] coat yesterday - outside - which I thought was absolutely ludicrous. He has asthma, which he is on constant medication for, so getting cold does him no good whatsoever. Because he went and got his coat back because he was cold, he has been put into isolation, that was his punishment. “Why would you take a coat off a child when you know they’ve got asthma   She continued: “Kids should not be worried about getting into trouble for keeping warm. It’s just nonsensical. When they’re going into a warm classroom it’s totally dferent, but when you’re going into a classroom with the doors and windows open, you soon get cold when you’re sitting down. “At some point, common sense has to prevail. These kids should not have to be cold.” Another mum said: “It was bitterly cold, freezing all day, and his hands were so cold that he couldn’t hold his pen in English. When he came out of school he was absolutely frozen. “These children are freezing outside, then they’re going into a classroom with the windows all open - they need to be warm. If we’ve got to have this rule,that’s what the headteacher wants, then please can he ditch his padded coat and can the teachers lead by example by all standing outside without their coats on  Because I think that would set a good example for the children. She added: “These children have a right to be warm. Another mum said: Some of the policies of the school are absolutely archaic. A lot of parents have been asking why their children have been put into isolation, and they’ve not really received any answers from the school.  Whether it’s raining, sleet or snow,it’s really Baltic cold, they’re not allowed to wear their jackets. Teachers will go up to them in the yard and tell them to get their coats off. They’re preaching about what an amazing school they are, but they’re not treating pupils with respect. A fourth parent added they felt Bishop Heber is more akin to a Victorian workhouse than a school. In an email to the parents of Year  students, head teacher David Curry explained the rationale behind the coat ban. He said he was aware that there’s been some discourse on social media about coats and why students cannot wear their own in school The email reads: I’d like to take this opportunity to state that students are allowed to wear coats to and from school as some have long journeys and have to wait for parents and or buses in the morning afternoon. However, once they arrive at school after registration period, we expect that an undergarmentalong with a school polo shirt, jumper, fleece and optional jacketwould be sufficient to keep them warm and conversely allow them to take layers off when in warmer classrooms. In essence, the four five layers of clothing we suggest should be more than ample to ask them to go out at break to get a blast of fresh air and withstand almost all weathers. We are fortunate at Heber that students almost always understand this and so usually it works really well. If we allowed non-unorm coats, we believe strongly that it would erode the great relationships we have with the students day to day as inevitably students would push the boundaries and wear hoodies and other coatsthat undermines the high standards we have. More importantly, I also believe that it would become a status issue for us and possibly make some students feel vulnerable. Many of the most expensive coatsand wearing owning the ‘right’ coat could become the motive rather than its thermal properties which I feel, could undermine what we stand for as a comprehensive school and put pressure on students in school and families to conform to a set of norms expectations that aren’t healthy, marginalising some students and putting at risk that sense of belonging which we work so hard to achieve at Heber. I hope our rationale makes sense and that our drive to ensure every child can be the best they can be is central to the decision. An Act of Parliament designed to reduce exorbitant school unorm costs was passed this year, and is set to come into force from this September. The Bill was introduced and championed by Mr Amesbury, MP for Weaver Vale and Shadow Local Government Minister. He said: “The reason I championed this cause was because too many children, families and carers were facing the strain of increased, prohibitive costs in terms of school unorms up and down the country, particularly around branded items of clothing. “Schooling should [be] about a child’s ability to do not their family’s ability to pay. “What is being reported by parents is clearly against the spirit of the Act. To hear about coats being confiscated in the middle of winter because they are deemed non-compliant with unorm policy, is plainly ridiculous. I agree with the principle of school unorm but would encourage Bishop Heber to get ahead of the game by adopting a more reasonable approach in its policy, with greater emphasis on affordability and less emphasis on insisting on every item must incorporate school branding.” Cheshire West and Chester Council and Ofsted both said that they do not have a policy on school unorm, and so could not comment on this case.

Sharon Evans, , had just had the joint replaced in an operation two months ago, following a diagnosis of hip dysplasia which affects the ability of the hip socket to remain in place. It comes as the health service faces unprecedent pressure with Covid infections soaring to record levels and having a knock on effect in other areas of the NHS, including staff shortages.The former NHS administrator says her heroic daughter, Lauren, , who rushed into action, has been left traumatised after watching her mum scream in agony with no pain relief for  hours.Despite initially being told it would be a six hour wait for paramedics when they called  at around pm on December , crews didn’t show up until shortly before am the following morning. Sharon, from Oswestry, Shropshire, said: “I was about to take my daughter out to meet a friend, I bent down to put my shoe on and I heard it pop.  “The pain was absolutely horrendous. They advised me not to move and not to eat or drink anything. “The only pain relief I had was paracetamol. “They told me to try and not move but it was absolutely freezing in the hallway where I had fallen, so I managed to drag myself past the door. “We were calling them every four hours to see where they were and they kept telling us someone was coming.  “I told them what I thought that it was an absolute joke. My daughter was shaking like a leaf.” After failing to get hold of her husband who was working, Sharon called her son, Luke, , who rushed home and stayed by her side with his sister. The pair called  every four hours for an update and were told each time the crews were coming. Sharon continued: “I think it has really affected my daughter, she was alone with me watching me screaming with pain on the floor and I do think it has really traumatised her. “She’s terried of it happening again. “My children are my heroes, I don’t know what I would have done without them. “I dread to thinkthis had happened to an elderly person living alone, I doubt they would have survived.” After undergoing emergency surgery, Sharon was discharged the following day and spent New Yearaposs Eve recovering in bed.  This week, NHS England revealed that December had been the worst month on record for treating people in Accident and Emergency within four hours. More than a quarter were left waiting over that threshold as just .% of patients across England were seen by AE staff within four hours during December. The figure is the lowest percentage since records began over a decade ago in November . Last year .% of patients seen within the time frame in December , Sky News reports. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: “The whole of the NHS remains under severe pressure and unfortunately, long hospital handover delays on the day meant some of our patients waited longer for an ambulance to come to them in the community than we would want. “We are working with all local partners across the health and care system to reduce delays so crews can respond to the next incident as quickly as possible.” “We would like to apologise to Mrs Evans for the time it took to reach her.

Springer spaniel Philip arrived at the vets weighing more than ten stone, which is three times heavier than he should be, and he could barely walk ten feet without collapsing.His owners had allowed him to binge on biscuits, cakes and other human foods. Philip had become so overweight that he had almost stopped eating altogether, CheshireLive reports.Edward Davies, a vet at the Cheshire Pets clinic at Holmes Chapel, chose to adopt Philip. He said: “I’ve been a vet for  years and I’ve never seen a dog as overweight as Philip. It was amazing that his legs could hold him up at all, and he was so big it was hard to even examine him to find out what was wrong. “He could have had a football-sized mass in his abdomen, and we wouldn’t have felt it underneath all the fat. But his blood tests actually came back surprisingly clear. “I thought he might have reached the end of the road but although his quality of le was virtually non-existent, we’d never want to put a dog to sleep when we feel we can treat and rehome it.”  At first, Philip was too unfit to go on walks with Mr Davies’ other dogs, Archie and Tilly. He would do circuits of the garden instead, to build up his stamina, and Mr Davies placed Philip on a firm diet. A big moment in Philip’s transformation was when one of the other dogs dropped a ball, and Philip brought it over to Mr Davies. He said: It was ashe was learning to play again, or maybe even for the first time. Now he’ll chase balls and pick up sticks. “We often go to a reservoir, and it was unbelievable to see him really take to the water. He absolutely loves swimming, and that’s been great for burning off calories.”Philip now weighs kg, with the weight loss improving not only his arthritis, but his quality of le.“His personality has really come out,” Mr Davies said. He’s such a friendly dog, and you just didn’t see that before.

It was built in  and is a Grade II listed building, but it was decommissioned in  and sold to a trust for preservation.According to the Met Office, fogbows are created by the same process of refraction and reflection that creates rainbows, but form instead by the water droplets in fog, mist or cloud, rather than raindrops.These water droplets are much smaller than raindrops, nearly always less than .mm in diameter. Due to the small water droplets, fogbows appear mostly white, with a red outer edge and blue inner edge. The fog bank has to be relatively dfused and thin to allow the light to pass through the droplets and create the effect. Fogbows are large, almost as big as rainbows.

The pair split over  years ago, with their orce finalised in , but the couple is known for having an unconventional relationship.Just last month, Sarah appeared on an Italian talk show where she said she stood by Andrew  per cent and explained that they share a love unlike any other.And previously, their unusual relationship has even seen them forced to deny they had got back together. Sarah once told the Daily Mail: Weaposre the happiest orced couple in the world. Weaposre orced to each other, not from each other.  Here we look at their unique relationship... Wedding and then orceAndrew and Sarah had been friends since they were children but it wasnapost until  that they started dating after being seated together at Royal Ascot that year.They got engaged nine months later on February ,  - his th birthday - and Andrew gave his we-to-be a ruby engagement ring.Their wedding was a grand affair at Westminster Abbey and afterwards, they shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.They welcomed their first daughter Princess Beatrice in  followed by Princess Eugenie in .But cracks had begun to appear in their relationship as Andrewaposs naval career saw him away from the family for long periods of time. And in  they split with their orce finalised in . Speaking to US TV host Ernie Manouse in , Sarah said: “My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer. “But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didn’t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. “For our marriage, I saw him  days a year.” Living arrangements Despite their split over  years and the fact that their daughters are now both in their s, Sarah and Andrew continue to live together at Royal Lodge in Windsor when she is in the UK. Speaking to the Sunday Times last year, Sarah said: I travel a lot and I’ve always been able to make wherever I am home. If I am staying in a hotel I have the same family photographs and scented candles around me.When I’m in the UK I’m lucky enough to stay at Royal Lodge. I wouldn’t call it my home as that would be presumptuous. Romance denial In , Sarah and Andrew enjoyed a getaway to Bahrain with Beatrice and her now-husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.At the end of a series of official engagements in the country she and Andrew attended the Bahrain Grand Prix. This prompted rumours that the couple had rekindled their relationship. But a spokesperson for the Duchess of York said at the time: The Duke and Duchess of York continue to be good friends and nothing has changed in their relationship. And a senior Palace source told the Mirror: While Duke and Duchess are not officially back together, it is fair to say their relationship is incredibly strong. The two of them are not involved in relationships with anyone , which of course likely to fuel rumours of an unlikely reunion. They very much enjoy each otheraposs company and their public displays of affection for one another are becoming more frequent. But for now they are enjoying spending time together and as a family. aposNever really left each otherapos Before the denial, in  Sarah even claimed she and Andrew had thought of remarrying but said the late Prince Philip wouldnapost allow it.And in  she admitted thatthey had their time again, they would stand up to those who pushed them apart. She said: “Both Andrew and I… both of us say nowwe could go back we would definitely play it dferently and we should have learnt how to play the chess game dferently. “And maybe we have still been together because we would have said ‘no ‘to being separated just after our wedding.” In  she also set tongues wagging when she told an Australian radio show that they never really left each other. But in an appearance last August on ITV show Loose Women, she swerved a question about a romantic reunion with her ex-husband.  Panellist Jane Moore asked her: You are the happiest orced couple they have ever seen! So, any chance of a rekindling of romance there  Sarah responded: Oh goodness me! Youaposre all fairytale, youaposve all got your wands out! Andrew and I remain steadfast. In the past, weaposve been co-parenting, and now weaposre co-grandparenting. Sarahaposs support In August last year, it was revealed that Andrew was being sued by a victim of paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who alleges he had sex with her three times after being trafficked at .The Duke vehemently denies the allegations and had been trying to have the civil case in the US thrown out before it can go to a trial.  But yesterday a judge ruled the case could proceed despite Andrewaposs objections, which means the Queenaposs second son is facing the prospect of an immensely damaging and costly court case in his future.Sarah came out in support of Andrew and last month told Italian talk show Porta a Porta this month: I completely stand by Andrew  per cent. He is such a kind, great man, he is a brilliant father and now a fantastic grandfather... I feel very strongly that in this day and age that we must stand by our hearts, what we think is right with integrity and honour and loyalty.

Image: Sheens BNPSByKatie L Wilson:,  Jan | commentsA tiny ft by ft beach hut in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, has gone on sale for a whopping £,. The wooden cabin’s owners, who have owned it for  years, have decided to cash in on it due to the increasing demand from staycationers. Whilst the hut has no running water or electricity, it does have uninterrupted sea views and immediate access to a sandy beach. Hut C, measuring in at sq ft, is situated on the sought-after Avenues section of Marine Parade. Huts in the area tend not to change hands for several decades.Very few beach huts came on sale during  and , since owners chose to keep hold of them with the lack of foreign holidays due to coronavirus lockdowns. There are about  huts in the Clacton area of the Tendring Peninsula. The area was part of a £m regeneration scheme in , which included  new bay beaches formed to the east of Clacton pier, creating lots of sandy beaches. The new owner of the hut would also be required to pay an annual licence fee to the local council, which is about £ for local residents and £ for non-residents. James Enfer, from estate agents Sheenaposs, who are selling the hut, said: The majority of huts in this area are in a single row directly facing onto the promenade where you can step straight onto the sandy beach. The huts do not have facilities connected, however there are public toilets, cafes and several water taps located along the sea front close by.  Each hut is unique, with vendors having fitted them out dferently, but most have some storage or kitchen style units. The owners have had this hut for around  years, and the owners before that having it for nearly  years. They tend to stay in the family for a generation or two. We saw very few come up for sale in the Clacton Holland area in  as most owners were so keen to keep hold of them during the first lockdown. With the shutdown on foreign holidays, demand for the British seaside holiday went through the roof. We saw many people prepared to pay good figures to secure themselves a beach hut which was their own to share with friends and family members. It is often a long term investment with many families holding onto their hut for over  years. Although the prices may seem high now they are always retained as an asset which can always be sold later on, so many see them as a good investment for themselves and their families to enjoy for years.

The Duke of York has repeatedly denied these allegations and his legal team believed the case should be dismissed. However, a US judge has ruled that the case will go ahead. The trial, which could be costly for the Royal, will leave Prince Andrew with the options including fighting the case or settling. While heaposs been doing this, heaposs also been looking for a buyer for his luxury £ million Swiss chalet.

Jackie Robles had visited the hairdressers to dye her light brown hair bright red as a treat. When she left she was delighted with the bright result and showed off her new look on her social media sites.But her joy turned to horror the next day when she washed it and said her tresses became so brittle it snapped in half as she touched it, reported the Daily Star. When she contacted her beautician she was told a possible cause of her ruined look was climate change. Jackie said: I was told it was probably the climate change that did it orI got in the ocean, but I made sure I didnapost get in the water because I had just dyed it. “When I came back I dyed it back to black and I had to cut my hair super short. My hair is still healing but it still feels very unhealthy at the ends.”  Posting her experience on TikTok Jackie, from Calornia, wrote: “ Little did I know this would be one of my worst days. It was a day before my Tulum trip. I had someone dye my hair red, everything felt fine until I washed it the next day and it looked like this. She said it was unexpected as her stylist had previously done a ‘great job” on other visits.  In desperation she asked some of her followers for advice, asking: “Any suggestions on how to get my hair healthy again  A hairstylist left a comment and suggested Jackie to use castor oil and Venanoci hair oil to keep her scalp and hair healthy. Most people on her social channels disagreed with the hairdresser and said it was ‘definitely’ her fault.  One said: She literally chopped your hair without you knowing and probably had high developer in your hair too. Another wrote: Your hair was already very damaged in the first picture but it was her fault for not telling you that and continuing to damage it more.

Quran had been at a fast-food restaurant managed by Cheryl’s son Chris, but romantic feelings didnapost blossom until much later.Since marrying in Autumn last year, Cheryl and Quran are now looking to start a family. “We got married in September , and it’s been a few months since we are ready to start a family,” says Quran. “Cheryl is  and has seven children and seventeen grandchildren already but we feel we deserve children of our own.Have your say on Cheryl and Quranaposs story in the comment section  “We have tried for children but with age, we feel surrogacy or adoption would be a better option. “We prefer surrogacy however we have seen a lot of people embroiled in legal complications far after the child is born. “We are looking for a nice surrogate who is willing to sign a contract to have nothing to do with the child after its born. “We donapost want people trying to have a baby for us for financial gain, we are not that financially inclined ourselves. “With adoption, we are looking for a biracial baby so the baby would know I have half black and half white parents so he would feel that we are his true parents. “Both of Cheryl’s daughters had hysterectomies in the last few years otherwise they would have been the best option for being as close to a biological child as possible.” Quran and Cheryl, from Rome, Georgia, are prepared for an unconventional parenting style, with Cheryl being much older. “We understand that I may not be there for as long as Quran is but I have faith in him,” says Cheryl. “If I am not here he can do it. Heaposs gonna be a great father, he’s a responsible adult. “I had every bit of faith that he could raise our child and do it very well. “Our family is also very supportive of our decision to have children, at first they were hesitant for the same reasons. “However, now five of my children have come to accept the idea and my mother-in-law and I make videos together.” After they first met, the pair lost contact for a while but reconnected on November ,  when caretaker Quran saw mum-of-seven Cheryl working as a cashier at a convenience store. Sparks flew between the pair instantly and they started dating and posting videos of themselves on TikTok but sadly faced some hate from fellow users. Grandmother of , Cheryl and Quran claim that despite their age dference their sex le is fantastic and they have great chemistry. The couple ended up getting married in an intimate wedding live-streamed and viewed by thousands of their TikTok fans in September . Cheryl and Quran say the hate receive on social media has increased a lot since they were featured in previous news articles. “People on social media have a lot of hate for us, they say I’m dating my grandmother,” says Quran. “I am not, she is younger than my grandmother, we are no dferent from any other couple, love is love. “We get a lot of hate but it doesnapost phase us. At the end of the day, we still got each other and thataposs all that matters. “No matter what they say or do, it can hurt us. We know the stuff that they say isnapost true and they believe it, we feel sorry for them.“Weaposre happy and no matter what they say weaposre not going to deflect on that.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesLoveAge gapStarting a familyAdoptionSurrogacyParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The wince-inducing incident was featured on this week’s episode of This Came Out Of Me , a Discovery Channel reality series profiling unusual and extreme medical emergencies treated by doctors.Ronald can be heard in the episode telling a nurse about how he had been fixing up his dune buggy outside in the garage when the “daggum bug flew in [his] ear.” The patient told doctors he believed the bug was still alive, explaining that the sensation was “really irritating”. “It feels like it’s got some wings and it’s down on my eardrum,” he said.  “Drives me crazy,” he adds. “I couldn’t stand up because it was just so uncomfortable … makes me just unstable.”According to theNew York Post , Dr. Greg Starr, assessing Ronald, soon discovered the bug had lodged itself inside his “left external auditory canal.”In a bid to either stun or kill the insect, Dr Starr injects several doses of lidocaine - a type of local anesthetic - into Ronald’s eardrum in a bid to either stun or kill the insect.  The patient can be seen writhing around in pain on a hospital bed, as three doses of the drug are administered into his ear. After the final dose, Ronald jerks his legs up in the air in discomfort and shakes his head as the big critter is removed from his ear canal, incredibly, still alive. “Looks like a moth,” Starr is heard remarking, while he holds the bug up to the camera. A video clip of the procedure in Texas has since gone viral on Facebook, where it drew reactions of shock, disgust and horror, in equal measure.“And … I’ll never sleep again,” wrote one viewer, along with a sick-face emoji. “My worst nightmare,” wrote another. A third wrote: “F**k that I would be jumping around as well that’s f**k[ed] up.” Discovery Channel series This Came Out Of Me premiered on January , based in Texas and profiling some of the most bizarre and extreme procedures performed by Emergency Room doctors across the state.  A press release from Discovery about the show said: “Working in the Emergency Room is all about rolling with the punches and is not for the squeamish.” “For the doctors and nurses at the  SignatureCare Emergency Center locations throughout Texas, it’s a chance to take on the challenge of helping people with painful, unusual, and sometimes even gruesome emergency cases.” Other horrying removals featured on the show include a patient whose leg became impaled by a slab of concrete and a toddler who swallowed a princess doll.

What do you think about paranormal activity  Let us know in the comments...Darren said: I felt very apprehensive after my first encounter, so after deep thought I decided to try and move them on with the help of the local church and spiritualists, hoping not to witness this again. I was told that the spirit had moved on and was hoping this would be the end of the matter. Kirsi has owned the Eight Kings for just over nine years and in that time sheaposs heard unnerving noises, had physical contact, and seen human shapes around the pub. Darren moved in about a year ago, and said that while paranormal activity has always been re at the pub - itaposs got much worse after the pair splashed out on a renovation.  Over three weeks in October and November, the couple shut the pub to spruce it up and since then family members and customers have been freaked out after being targetted by spirits living in the pub. After the reopening on Wednesday, November , Darren said more people were reporting seeing or feeling a ghost. He continued: We had a family sat in the bar they told a member of staff there was a lady in the restaurant waiting to be served, no lady was there. Another family said exactly the same thing and described the exact lady down to clothing, there was no connection to either families.

Speaking to Liberation Times, he said: I [noticed] a light or orb hovering along the top of the tree line, I’d thought it was just a star at the time but as I continued surveilling the area, the light orb shot above the treetops and hung there for some time. Maybe it was a satellite I thought.But then, just as a transport team arrived to secure the weapon, the orb bounced a little in the sky then shot to the leftthen shot  degrees straight up and disappeared.

After hearing the footsteps a couple of times he got up to investigate and had a chilling encounter with something that was not entirely human.

I have told her that I think the allowance amount is too low, but she disagrees. Another example is that she will buy meals to bring to the restaurant to be microwaved. We have gotten looks before and itaposs always turned down. It results in her making a fuss and will be asked to leave. I have told her that she needs to stop and that when we go out, I am fine with her ordering whatever she wants.

Although he had told his partner it was okay to order whatever she wanted off the menu, she still decided to bring a ready meal with her - and the man accused her of embarrassing their son on his special day.

That makes it so much worse. But another sympathised with the mum, stating: Your we probably needs some counselling as there is some deep-seated issues she has with money and spending.

Paulina Tenner, , and her husband, Daniel, , from Hackney, east London, had been married four years when the topic arose. Paulina, , realised she was attracted to both men and women and told Daniel she was keen to explore this dynamic. She used to work as a burlesque dancer which she says started her sexual awakening. After opening up to her partner, she was reassured that he was happy for her to explore this side of her sexuality. Over time, this saw both partners starting to have sex with other people - and they say it has taken their relationship from strength to strength. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The couple is actively considering having a family at the moment and say they would be honest with their child about their situation. Paulina said: It wouldnapost affect our relationship and we would still be open about our le with our childwe decided to start a family. Itaposs healthy to tell a child that you can love many people in le, rather than just one person forever. We know some amazing poly parents. We believe there is a social good in sharing our story. The couple opened their relationship in  after four years of marriage, and say it strengthened their relationship. Dating outside of our marriage has improved our relationship because it has enabled us to identy how wewithin relationships, what weaposre good at and not so good at, added Paulina. It has also helped us become more aware of our desires and boundaries, and therefore we can be more clear with each other about what we enjoy sexually and in relationships. This has been very helpful for us, especially after being together since .  Human and sexual connection is one of the best things that le has to offer, and therefore we feel like we would be betraying each otherwe were holding the other person back from this. We know that we canapost give each other absolutely everything we need, and seeing other people helps avoid placing an expectation on the other to fulfil all our needs. We have so much desire for the other to enjoy le to the fullest. It would be greatmore people were aware of the fact that there are many dferent models of relationships that can be healthy and fulfilling. It doesnapost just have to be one person for the rest of your le. That works for some people and it can be beautul, but it isnapost the only successful relationship model. After Paulina revealed in  that she was keen to explore her attraction to women, they separately attended tantric and relating workshops. This started to open them up to the ability to connect romantically and sexually with others, said Paulina. She added: I also used to be a burlesque dancer which I think started my sexual awakening. I have even written a book, called Laid Bare: What the Business Leader Learnt from the Stripper, about how my journey as a burlesque dancer led to my relationship with sexuality and sensuality and made me a more integrated and powerful leader in business. I discovered I was bi-curious and after openly communicating this with Daniel and finding out he was comfortable with it, I went on a journey of exploring connections with other women At first I was anxious about how he would respond as I didnapost want him to think I was a secretly lesbian and going to leave him, but he didnapost feel threatened. In the beginning, Daniel wasnapost comfortable with me seeing other men. But after lots of self-development, we are both at a place in our relationship where we communicate skilfully and clearly and donapost have to rely on rules. Being transparent and open with each other is the key to our relationship, we talk about everything whereas some people have a donapost see and donapost tell approach but every poly couple is dferent. Opening our relationship it has brought more juiciness and beauty to our lives.  It has even brought us closer together because we have so much more to discuss and share with each other now. And we also learnt to focus on protecting the time that we spend together. While the couple says that polyamory has improved their relationship, they have also faced some struggles when adapting to this model of relationship. Daniel said: We have started focusing on protecting our time together because we got to a point where we were dating quite a lot of people and not prioritising us. So we closed our relationship for a little while so we could work out and resolve our problems. We experience bumps in the road in our relationship, as any couple does, but they are rarely because of being poly. We may go through phases of opening and closing the relationship but it is not likely that we will leave this behind now that we have explored it. We donapost have problems caused by jealousy because we are both getting what we want and we arenapost in fear of losing the other person. We feel joy when we see our partner feeling fulfilled by another relationship. In our books,you really love someone you want them to be completely happy and have a wonderful le. The couple believes that open relationships can help avoid betrayal and cheating that happens in monogamous relationships. Paulina says that instead of being desperately unhappy and miserable in a monogamous relationship, people should realise that there are alternatives. She added: Instead of remaining in an unhappy relationship and cheating on your partner because you arenapost fulfilling each otheraposs needs, people should be more aware and accepting of open relationships and this is why we are speaking out about our story. I was even doubting myself at the beginning because I was brought up as a catholic and one of my values was to have one core relationship for le and it had been like that in my family for generations. I wasnapost sureI wanted to change that, but since doing so it has been the best both a gt and a growth opportunity.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageStarting a familySexuality\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We had not much opportunities for an education. For young women in our area, our options were retail, drug dealing, prostitution, or hoping a rich guy would notice us. For guys it was retail, drug dealing, or finding one of the few factory jobs remaining, the -year-old woman wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.I got lucky, managed to date a med student, he helped open doors for me and I have become a teacher in a school in a lower socioeconomic area to provide those opportunities and my husband is now a doctor.  Her friend, however, was not so fortunate and was still working a minimum wage retail job when she was . During that time though, she grew close to a factory worker who would regularly come by and they started dating. He knew he was not the academic type, school was not for him, but he also saw potential in my friend and encouraged her to go school. She had dreams of becoming a criminal prosecutor and he encouraged her to not give up, she continued. He took out whatever loan he could find so that she could get an education. He supported her through and through, did the house work, worked extra shts, everything so she could get an education. Her friend worked hard, graduated and became a lawyer, and shortly afterwards, she broke up with her boyfriend, just as he was planning to propose.

She said that as a professional, she had no interest being married to a working class man and that she aposdeserves a real man.apos I was horried and told her that she is betraying a man who has supported her through all this and made her what she is. She got mad and said that it is not the womanaposs job to pay the bills and that I am a hypocrite cause my husband makes a lot more than me, the woman wrote. She further said that the idea of marriage as a le partnership is a patriarchal construct, that she has the right to date whoever she wants, and that as a feminist I should be supporting her. I told her that she is not only a major a**hole, she is giving feminists a bad name because feminism means women financially supporting their male partners as much as in the reverse. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether she was right to call out her now-ex bestie and was met with overwhelming support. She used him. This has nothing to do with feminism. She took his love, his graciousness... and led him to believe they had a future together, while bleeding him dry, one Reddit user commented. She is a vampire. She does not have the requisite morality to be considered for your friendship, because youaposre a good person. She is not. Another added: I’m much happier being married to alabourer who did  years laying rail on the high plains, than I was to my rich but cheating bastard of a first husband. I found out that I enjoy hanging out with these blue collar workers than I was going to glitzy s and being ignored. I’m highly educated, holding three degrees, and never am I disappointed with the conversation among my new people. She is an a**hole, and I’m so sorry for the man she took advantage of!Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Here, Marcos Vargas, who volunteers with our charity partner Raleigh International, writes how demand for peanuts in the UK and Europe is driving unnatural dust storms in Nicaragua.Find out more and support the work of Raleigh International here.Doors are bolted closed, shutters on windows come down and people put on their facemasks. This is no lockdown, but a normal summer in the Central American city of Leon, Nicaragua, which is plagued by unnatural dust storms every year - because of demand for peanuts in the UK and Europe. Peanuts are one of Nicaragua’s biggest exports but because of the way they are farmed, every summer cities suffer from dust whirlwinds, which affect air quality.  “Before the pandemic I used to wear face masks due to dust storms. Our houses are never clean,” says Pedro Caballero, a -year-old student, living in the Chacraseca district of León’s rural area, which is devoted to agricultural production. “Throughout my le I have suffered from dust blisters and for me summer is the worst season. I am always sick during the dusty season and I just have to wait for winter to come. “We have to eat quickly, we must keep the containers of water and food, doors and windows are always closed.” He says his family are directly affected in the summer due to the house’s proximity to peanuts crops.  “I live in an agricultural community surrounded by crops and the most terrible time is after the peanut harvest. The soil is completely arid, the land remains loose and when the wind blows the houses are completely covered with powder,” he adds. This crop is being exported in record quantities to Europe. In , , tonnes of peanuts were sent to the UK, accounting for % of total Nicaraguan peanut exports, leading Nicaraguan soils to be overexploited. More than , hectares of land in León - the size of about , football pitches - is devoted to peanut farming.  The problem existed before peanut farming when the land was used for cotton but that made way for peanut cultivation in the s. Since then, the land has been decimated because the soil has been exploited far beyond what is sustainable. The dust gets so bad in Leon, it’s referred to by some residents as the Eternal Black Summer.  Hanzell Benavides, , who volunteers with Raleigh International, says: “It leads to respiratory diseases and poor sanitary conditions of the areas when peanut crops are cut every six months during the summer. “The worst thing about dust storms in León is how irritated your eyes and skin get due to the excess of dust. “You can’t blink without feeling dust grains in your eyes, and can’t cough without inhaling dust particles. “Even the traffic gets worse, drivers cannot see the street and businesses are forced to close.”  After harvesting the peanuts, farmers collect the stubble, which is the remaining stem and leaves of the plant rooted in the ground, and it’s then sold on as cattle feed. But this process removes any remaining plants and nutrients in the ground, leaving only dirt which then causes the dust storms.  In addition, the soils lose substantial amounts of fertility every time one of these whirlwinds occur. And trees, a natural windbreaker, have been cut down to make way for more agricultural land which causes the dust to blow into nearby communities. Dr Xiomara Castillo, a soil scientist from León, explains: “Peanut farming is a good example of how agriculture increasingly degrades our soils.  “The process of peanut farming, primarily during harvesting, involves tractors lting the root structure of the peanut, which contains the peanut kernel and by straining and filtering, all the fine particles are removed from the soil. “Since there is no windbreak protection system or soil cover protection system, trade winds blow over the land and carry practically all fine particles away.” Among the companies that import peanuts from Nicaragua is KP, one of Britain’s biggest peanut brands. A spokesman said: “We have a strict supplier selection policy, which includes a requirement that suppliers comply with our Responsible Sourcing Policy and includes the obligation to be a member of SEDEX.  “We have a long-standing partnership with our supplier in Nicaragua, which deals directly with the farmers it sources from. Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Central America and agriculture forms a signicant part of the economy. “We are aware of the challenges related to dust storms during the dry season, which pre-dates the peanut industry in Nicaragua, and we are committed to working in partnership with our supplier to help influence the use of more sustainable and regenerative practises across the region. Raleigh International is a global youth action organisation supporting a global movement of young people to take action for the planet.Young people are at the forefront of building a fairer, more inclusive and greener world, and are actively confronting the planet’s most urgent crises through Raleigh International’s Action Not Excuses global campaign. Dame Chance – meaning ‘to give a chance’ - is an Action Not Excuses campaign led by young people in Nicaragua to reduce deforestation and improve green livelihoods.Dame Chance is tackling deforestation and unemployment by helping , local farmers to increase forest cover. Through the work of this Action Not Excuses campaign, young people from rural communities are developing new job opportunities and working with local communities to conserve and protect Nicaragua’s precious forests.  “The use of Good Agricultural Practices is a contractual requirement for all farmers that supply to our peanut supplier. “Since , our supplier has worked in coordination with the Nicaraguan Environment Ministry to plant , trees, the equivalent of  hectares in Nicaragua. “The planting of trees is a key strategy to stabilise soils, restore watersheds and create living barriers to reduce dust storms. Our supplier is working towards a long term goal of reforesting a total of , hectares of trees by .” Nicaragua fact file The Daily Mirror’s NextGen International project builds on the success of our UK initiative, where we gave young people a voice and published the stories that matter to them. Now the project has gone global, focusing on the climate emergency and empowering young people in six countries to tell their stories of how they have been affected by the crisis.Countries taking part in the project are Nigeria, Nicaragua, the Solomon Islands, Brazil, Nepal and Mongolia.The project was originally working with a group of six teenagers in Kabul, Afghanistan, with our charity partner Save the Children. Midway through the project in August, Kabul fell to the Taliban and it was no longer safe for the young people to continue. Afghanistan was chosen because it is one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world.It is hugely regrettable the project was unable to complete in the country but the safety of the young people involved was paramount. The Mirror was awarded funding from the European Development Journalism Grants, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

It comes as nearly  million positive cases have been recorded in the UK, with the number of deaths topping ,, the latest government figures show. Worldwide, there have been more than m cases while the number of deaths have reached .m.Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organisationaposs special envoy on Covid-, told Sky News: Iaposm afraid we are moving through the marathon but thereaposs no actual way to say that weaposre at the end - we can see the end in sight, but weaposre not there.And thereaposs going to be some bumps before we get there. Professor Graham Medley, a member of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the sht towards living with Covid- would be a phased transition.It canapost be an emergency forever, he told BBC Radio aposs Today.So at some point it will have to stop being an emergency but that is likely to be a phase out rather than an active point in time where somebody can declare the epidemic over. It comes as Boris Johnson said he would act according to the science around cutting the self-isolation period for Covid- cases.Experts are examining whether the period could be cut from seven to five days for cases, something which would help ease staffing crises across the economy and public services. Mr Johnson also pledged that free lateral flow tests would be available for as long as it is necessary as ministers considered how to move to a position of living with Covid-.The Prime Minister said testing was an important line of defence, along with vaccinations, in the face of the Omicron wave. The Prime Minister is under pressure from Tory MPs to commit to ending restrictions and sht to a position where Covid- is treated in a similar way to other illnesses which do not require state interventions. There is also a debate in Cabinet about cutting the self-isolation period, as the United States has done.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is among ministers keen on the economic benefits of reducing the period from seven to five days, according to the Daily , while Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has suggested the move could help ease staffing problems. Asked about the issue on a visit to a vaccine clinic at a pharmacy in his Uxbridge constituency, Mr Johnson said: The thing to do is to look at the science. We are looking at that and we will act according to the science. Following reports that the supply of free lateral flow devices will end as part of the Governmentaposs plan to live with Covid, Mr Johnson said: We are going to have to make sure we continue to use testing as one of our most important lines of defence for as long as is necessary.

The married woman had her first child with her current husband, but found he carries a hereditary disorder which could be passed on to their kids.She tracked down potential donors on social media and thought sheaposd found the perfect man for the job. After the  encounters, their efforts paid off and she conceived in July .  Soon after, the mum-of-two learned that the man sheaposd been sleeping with for the purposes of insemination was in fact a married Chinese national who did not attend the high-ranking university he claimed to.It being too late to abort the pregnancy, the woman chose to put the baby up for adoption.She is now suing the biological dad for fraud after his lies caused her emotional distress. A Vice News investigation released yesterday revealed that Japanaposs sperm donation industry is largely unregulated Articial insemination, which requires no sexual activity between the donor and mother, is dficult to access - and when offered it is only available for straight couples. Parents and parent-hopefuls are now turning to social media and other websites to find viable donors. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, the womanaposs lawyer criticised the countryaposs lacks of public or legal systems for sperm donation. He relayed that the alleged fraud has left his client physically and emotionally distressed She has also suffered further hurt from the widespread backlash against her decision to put the child up for adoption. Japanese child welfare officer, Mizuho Sasaki, tarred the woman as shallow for treating the child like an object, Vice News reports.

care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

Only a small number of these entanglements were previously known, demonstrating that entanglements are hugely under-reported.The interviews also revealed that a wider range of species were involved than previously known.Fishers also participated in training events and workshops to promote best practice, reducing entanglement risk and safely disentangling large marine animals from fishing gear.This training gave fishermen the ability to call on each other and provide a rapid response to any entangled animal.#We all find it upsetting to see our majestic marine species in distress,# said Dr Kirstie Dearing, NatureScot#s fisheries advisor, #so we#re really heartened by the strong commitment and willingness of the fishing industry to work towards practical, safe and sustainable solutions on the issue of entanglement.#We will only solve this problem by working in collaboration on potential legislative changes.#The new reporting obligation will also help us to understand the extent of the issue more clearly.#Based on feedback from the fishers, the report recommends a number of ways to combat marine entanglement, including trials of weighted ropes – ropes which sink rather than float – and tighter regulation to limit the amount of gear in the water and caps on creel numbers, all of which were supported by fishers involved in the study.Other recommendations include developing seasonal distribution maps of vulnerable species to identy potential high risk areas and trials of #on-call# – or ropeless – fishing systems."},{"url":null,"title":"running shoes on as race

out most towns and communities in the east of the county.And most respondents insisted that the only place where they would be acceptable would be the Honest Toun.People were asked their views as East Lothian Council consulted over whether it needed to introduce a licensing policy for sexual entertainment venues.The policy, which could also apply to swingers clubs and private house parties, comes after the Scottish Government gave local authorities discretionary powers to introduce the additional licences.A survey launched on the East Lothian Consultation Hub asked for public views on whether venues should be licensed and which locations would be acceptable for such venues and which would not.The findings, which go before the council’s licensing sub-committee tomorrow , saw a majority of those giving a view naming Musselburgh as the only suitable place.Residents in the east of the county insisted that their towns and villages would not be suitable, with Gullane, North Berwick and Dunbar all ruled out by those taking part.The vast majority of people responding told the council that they did not believe anywhere was suitable for sex venues in East Lothian, with most also responding to a question about the number of licensed venues the county should allow by saying there should be zero.When asked which locations were unsuitable for such venues, responses included: “Gullane, North Berwick, Dunbar”, “wherever you’re thinking of putting them” and “the rest of East Lothian except for Musselburgh”.One respondent, however, suggested the county’s secluded Archerfield and Renaissance golf clubs as suitable sites, pointing out that they were “away from public locations”.While another pointed to unused sites across the county, adding: “There is a lot of wasteland areas in small towns such as Haddington I can think of from the top of my head that would be more than perfect for establishing a business like this.”This week’s sub-committee meeting will be asked to consider introducing a licensing policy, with members warned that having no policy would leave the county open to sex clubs opening without any controls in place to oversee them.However, a report to members added: “Introducing the licensing of sex entertainment venues is not equivalent to accepting or supporting such businesses.“That control could,deemed appropriate, include a policy setting the number of such businesses to be permitted at zero.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-19-impact-staffing-sees-pupils-study-home","story":"High school pupils in S worked remotely yesterday but ed to

He is treating the people of this country with total disdain and like we are fools. This makes me very angry.Errors made by previous Prime Ministers, for which they humbly apologised and survived to carry on in their role, were by and large “one-off” events, not really “felt” by iniduals or households to any personal degree. This said, the most recent error made by Mr Johnson, flagrantly attending what was clearly a social gathering at No  – we now know with more than  people – at a time when every household across the UK was suffering in one way or another due to lockdown rules or restrictions, is one which is very deeply felt by every UK household.He simply does not realise the immense damage his actions and deceitfulness have done and the associated implications regarding his credibility and trustworthiness, to him as a leader.Displaying such irresponsible, selfish and misleading behaviour has resulted in him having lost the confidence and respect of the majority of UK voters, including myself as a loyal Conservative, and importantly as I understand it, many of his Cabinet colleagues.Not only is he now a real danger to the longer-term success of the Conservative Party, but there is no way he can possibly have the support and loyalty of those around him to develop, implement and drive those policies and initiatives we need to deal with and manage the very serious issues that the country faces and that require to be urgently addressed.The United Kingdom deserves, and indeed now more than ever needs, a far better leader than this.Paul McPhail, Glasgow.WHY MY DESPAIR TURNED TO FURYLISTENING to Boris Johnson at PMQs trying to weasel out of the mire that he has created for himself was quite excruciating. I then listened to Conservative junior minister Rachel Maclean talking on the BBC’s Politics Show and my despair turned to fury. When she was asked whether Boris Johnson’s attendance at the drinks party for  minutes was a breach of the regulations she responded that she didn’t know. I couldn’t decideshe is so short of intelligence that she doesn’t understand the rules that everyone in the country understands orshe thinks that the British public are as stupid as her and believe anything she says.I was reminded of the Dominic Cummings episode when the Tory Government first rehearsed its strategy for ignoring the rules that it had imposed. It all makes me despair at the lack of integrity of our politicians.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.* I LISTENED with great interest to the Prime Ministers apology on this weeks Prime Ministers Questions. It raised several questions in my mind: first, on whose behalf were invitations to the gathering issued  Secondly, did the PM receive an invitation  Thirdly, does the PM usually attend work meetings where those attending bring along their own bottles Christine R McLachlan, Milton of Campsie.REPLACEMENTS FROM THE SAME MOULDIT is hard not to agree wholeheartedly with the call by Ian Blackfordfor Prime Minister Johnson to resign. However, he cites as one of the reasons for this call Boris Johnsons “loss of moral authority”. Surely it must be glaringly evident that Mr Johnson never had any vestige of such authority As a proven serial liar, adulterer and power-hungry hypocrite, it simply beggars belief that sufficient of the electorate was seduced by his  bonhomie to put this person into a position of high office.Sadly, evenhe is forced to resign, the likely replacements are from the same awful mould, concerned only with clinging on to power in order to do the bidding of their shady billionaire backers, with no thought of the consequences for the rest of us.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD STAYNO doubt the SNP and its supporters will use the allegations that Boris Johnson held parties in Downing Street during lockdown as yet another reason why Scotland should separate from the rest of the UK.In fact, the opposite is true. Regardless of our political views, we are fortunate to live in a country where iniduals, the media, Parliament and even elected members of his own party are free to report, investigate, criticise and publicise alleged wrongdoing by the Prime Minister. Once allegations are investigated, any proven misleading, lawbreaking or poor judgment can then be judged and punished either by his party, Parliament, the legal system, at the ballot box, or all four. This is the result of hundreds of years of evolving democracy and the rule of law in our islands and is something the citizens of many countries can only dream of.The absence of consequences following the Holyrood parliamentary committee’s conclusion that the First Minister had misled the Scottish Parliament about her actions during the handling of the allegations against Alex Salmond, combined with the SNP’s omerta-like intolerance of internal dissent, do not inspire confidence in swtly achieving similar maturityScotland were to separate.Mark Openshaw, Aberdeen.DISRESPECT FOR SCOTS DEMOCRACYThis is expressed most brutally by Alan Sutherland, whose aim is to take the UK and Scotland back to before  and the setting up of the devolved Parliament at Holyrood. I won’t try to summarise his argument because beyond that Mr Sutherland is not only opposed but contemptuous of what it is doing – despite the election of its governmentby the majority of those who voted last May – there is none. “This mess started with devolution and Labour, it should be its mission to clear it up”, or put it this way: “I don’t like it, get rid of it”, despite that voter turnout in the  election reached . per cent, the highest ever at a Scottish Parliament election.Peter A Russell offers a more subtle example, claiming “the precedents [for a national convention] are not exactly propitious”. However, his precedents appear to be the Russian Revolution and UDI in Rhodesia. Its not exactly clear how even the latter applies here, and as for the former, maybe there are some political developments not being reported .In his conclusion Mr Russell recommends an \"analysis\" of the independence case, concluding with the astonishing suggestion that“these questions are answered to the satisfaction” of % of the electorate, then and only then should there be a referendum. This suggests that Mr Russell has no awarenessthat the UK has changed so signicantly since  – most notably regarding Brexit, the consequences of which are still to become fully clear – that there is a parallel obligation on those of Mr Russell’s view to put forward a case for the Union, why Scotland should remain part of the UK.In this way Mr Russell shares Mr Sutherland’s disrespect for Scottish democracy. Only independence is to be scrutinised , but don’t even mention any possibility of the same for staying in the Union. Andthere is to be independence it should be by a majority which most certainly was not attained by the Brexit vote, and indeed has never before been required in the history of British politics.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SWINNEY IS THE FALL GUYYET again, this morning , John Swinney was on BBC radio struggling to explain some of the Scottish Government decisions with regard to Covid restrictions.

Mr Swinney, the loyal number two, makes the uncomfortable media appearances and suffers while Nicola Sturgeon reserves hers for statesman-style performances at Holyrood where she avoids directly answering questions, uses paragraphs when a sentence would do to use up time and mocks those who dare criticise.She is so lucky that Boris Johnson provides so many reasons to deflect attention from her governance.Duncan Sooman, Milngavie.Read more: Labour should stay clear of devo-max"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-centre-george-taylor-announcement-retirement-rugby-health-grounds","story":"“My decision to step away from rugby is ultimately down to health reasons and I’ve got to think about my health for the future,” Taylor said yesterday in an announcement on Edinburgh’s website. “I’ve had a history of head injuries that have set me back for months, so after a lot of discussion with management and family, I’ve come to the conclusion that I should step away and move on to other opportunities.“It’s certainly not been a quick decision.

Favourites from the sketch show included the Big Man, Ronald Villiers and the woman who can smell \"s***e,\" or a lie, from miles away.It also featured characters such as Dunbar’s randy Auld Betty, the chain-smoking family who use voice boxes. It also features an infamous scene involving an female ice-cream van worker lting her skirt up to two young boys.Some of the material deemed unacceptable will be revealed in the documentary Karen Dunbar: The Comedy of Offence which is set to be broadcast later this year.In the wake of the controversy, the BBC responded: “The BBC regularly reviews older content to ensure it meets current audience expectations. This is part of our process when repeating archive content including comedy.”Scots comedian Leo Kearse, who appeared in the documentary, criticised the cuts and called on the BBC to stop censoring art.\"He said: \"Now theyre editing Chewin The Fat - a fun, apolitical, good hearted comedy - in case it offends modern sensibilities.

And it is certainly not my understanding of the situation.\": Ferry chaos prompts fears for leline supplies as Arran is left with only enough fuel for nine carsSam Bourne, chairman of the Arran Ferry Action Group said: \"Mairi Gougeon does appear to have created an additional piece of travel advice with the request to ‘consider whether your ferry trip is essential’. \"This is not our understanding of the current CalMac travel advice. Or Scotrail, for example. \"Many islanders currently only make what are, to all intents, ‘essential journeys’ precisely because of the current sailing-by-sailing travel dficulties, and the risk of not being able to travel, or getting stranded on the mainland.   If the advice is indeed now ‘essential ferry travel only’, what additional support would be made available to hospitality businesses and others affected, who are already scunnered by the endless disruption, as highlighted by Jamie Greene MSP.\"The cabinet secretary gave the advice as West Scotland MSP Katy Clark asked what the Scottish Government was doing to support Arran in the wake of ferry cancellations caused by staff absences due to Covid, and poor weather.The Herald on Sunday revealed that the ferry chaos had raised concerns about shortages of vital supplies through a raft of service restrictions which saw Arran almost run out of fuel.Issues with sailing cancellations and fuel storage issues meant last Wednesday there was only  litres of fuel left on Arran for visitors and residents - only enough to fill nine family cars.Ms Gougeon said: \"I just want to say that of course we are aware of the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on Arran and other island communities.\"And I know how frustrating that is when at short notice ferry services are affected.\"I think we cant lose sight of the fact, or lose sight of why these services are leline ones because obviously children need them to get to school and residents need them to access services on the mainland. Public services and local businesses need them to be able to get their workers back and forth.\"And we just wanted to use this opportunity to emphasise that we need everyone to consider carefully the current advice, which is to stay at home as much as possible and whether the ferry trip is essential because every time someone takes the virus on board a ferry it puts the health of crews at risk, which then puts the service at risk and that has signicant wider impacts, some of which weve seen recently.The cabinet secretary was also unable to commit to meet passenger groups to \"discuss the challenges\" after being invited by Ms Clark.She said: \"I mean, Im sure the member will be aware that a lot of these matters in particular in relation to ferries, are the responsibility of the transport minister but I do I try and engage as much as I possibly can personally with my responsibilities and my overall responsibilities for the islands.\"CalMac said on Wednesday that the  latest figures show that  crew and  port staff are currently unavailable because of Covid. This equated to a Covid absence rate of .% amongst all staff and is in addition to a non-coronavirus absence rate of %.As CalMac brought in its \"essential services\" ferry timetable at Hogmanay, it said that  crew and  port staff were absent – nine per cent of crews and five per cent of port staff, on top of a non-coronavirus absence rate of  per cent.Last week the overhaul of one ferry was delayed till Friday as concerns over supplies surfaced on Arran which has been hit with a series of service cancellations.Friday saw another raft of sailings go after another Covid outbreak left the island with no dedicated service for much of the day.Five food lorries, stranded for up to two days managed to leave Arran last Wednesday as other visitors spoke of being unable to leave after services on the island came to a standstill the previous weekend.Questions about the resilience of CalMacs ageing ferry fleet were heightened after curbs to services due to high winds led to  leline CalMac ferry routes suffering suspensions on Thursday, last week.Arran ferry users questioned why the Gourock port of refuge was not used as their services were suspended, despite £.m being spent on it to cut cancellations in bad weather."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmPotential delays and ersions are set to affect motorists over the coming weeks throughout the centre of Kirkwall.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They have got too many quality players to try and highlight one or two.“They’ve always shown the ability to beat the best at any time. I think where the frustration would have been from their end was that consistency of performance week in, week out. vw,vw,px, px\"Harlequins celebrate winning the Gallagher Premiership title last season “I don’t think anyone doubted that they had the quality within their squad to be pushing the best teams, and they showed on a regular basis that they were as good as anybody and they could beat anybody on the day.“It was just the consistency that they would have to demonstrate to win the league, and that’s exactly what they did.“They keep on playing, wear you down and get the result. They’ve done it the Quins way, playing on the front foot and trying to score tries, and I think it has been great for rugby. They are a pleasure to watch.”Key to Quins’ success has been the sustained form of their England international fly-half Marcus Smith, and Young added: “He is a real quality player.“He sees things that people don’t see, and he is so sharp to react to opportunities. vw,vw,px, px\"England fly-half Marcus Smith is a key man for Harlequins “But they have got talent everywhere. That eight-nine-- axis is huge for them, and they have got so much gas out on the flanks.”Welsh Government coronavirus restrictions – elite sport in the country has been behind closed doors since Boxing Day – mean no crowd for Quins’ visit.Young said: “There would have been a fantastic atmosphere. You can’t hide the fact it is not great playing in empty stadiums.“It is better than not playing at all, but only marginally, I think, to be honest. We haven’t had too many games when we’ve had crowds, so they can’t come quick enough.“We understand it is all about making sure people stay healthy and safe. We get that. But when it comes to playing a game, there is no substitute to playing in front of supporters.”Cardf, meanwhile, will be without Wales international back-row forward James Botham for the Quins encounter.Botham, who is the grandson of England cricket great Sir Ian Botham, was carried off during last Saturday’s United Rugby Championship game against Edinburgh following a head-on-head collision with an opposition player.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We shouldn’t even be having that conversation.“There are a huge number of pieces of this Bill where in fact it is simply a tidying up exercise that our legislation has not kept pace with the changing nature of the digital world.”He added there was often an issue of the “resources police allocate to online crime”, with online crime often “treated fundamentally dferently”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia. My own objective was to learn to speak Gaelic, a language I had not heard until I set foot on the island, which in those days was almost entirely Gaelic-speaking.Canna House, where Campbell lived with his we Margaret Fay Shaw, had much  to offer: a well-stocked Celtic library , and just as important, a series of Gaelic and literary visitors, arriving from all over western Europe and North America. Conversations at the dinner table were always lively. MacLellan of South Uist was still living, and though up in years was one of the best ever recorded and well worth visiting. century the Skye ethnographer Martin Martin remarks on the quality of South Uist Gaelic.Campbell had provided letters of introduction to his main Gaelic contacts.

When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641997282895.jpg--covid_19___wed_12th_january_figures.jpg?1641997282000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220112newscovid 19 wed 12th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Credit: PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAt last, some explanation and some contrition. But the Prime Minister’s long-overdue statement to Parliament on Wednesday at the stroke of noon posed yet further questions which will dog him in the coming days.That it took so long for the Prime Minister to even admit he attended the now-notorious party on th May  — which could have easily been delivered to camera outside Downing Street or in a studio hours or even days before — is yet more evidence he is being badly advised.  Or, as I strongly suspect, it’s worse than that: diligent advisers who did the job I used to are giving Boris Johnson the correct advice, but he is ignoring it.His excuses will not convince his MPs, or the public.The contention that “I didn’t know it was a party” has already been widely ridiculed, as have hollow words about the Downing Street garden being an extension of the workplace.Many quite reasonably ask: since when was a work event labelled BYOB  Downing Street has a beautul, large garden and as a journalist and former special adviser I have often attended s there in non-Covid times.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up There is no doubt what the rules were in May .  Less than an hour before the party, the then-Culture Secretary even reminded us of those rules from another part of Downing Street at a press conference, beamed into homes across the UK.On Wednesday, I did what the Prime Minister took so long to get around to, and checked my diary from May .Less than  hours after the Prime Minister’s event with  colleagues, knocking back wine and enjoying the London sunshine, I attended the funeral of my great aunt Beryl in Lisburn. There was no service. Close members of Beryl’s family unable to even touch her coffin to say goodbye.  Around  people in total there, all socially distanced, for the shortest time possible.Countless other people will have similar — and indeed much worse — tales of sacrices made because of rules we were instructed to follow. Political scandals come and go. Who can honestly recite the finer details of the lobby scandal engulfing the former Secretary of State Owen Paterson in November Who can remember to whom David Cameron sent those Greensill WhatsApps, and why  The danger with Partygate is that it’s so straightforward: the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom imposed a draconian lockdown on the country, and then ignored it himself. Doctors died and Boris boozed.Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish Nationalists in Westminster, demands almost every week at Prime Minister’s Questions that Boris Johnson resigns, to the groans of MPs.For two years, Sir Keir Starmer has never once done the same, nor has he straightforwardly called the Prime Minister a liar.On Wednesday he did both, and that is signicant.And, late on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, Douglas Ross, called for the Prime Minister to go — the first Conservative MP to publicly do so.We know Mr Ross has also written to the chairman of the  committee — the backbenchers’ shop steward, essentially — Sir Graham Brady, to express his lack of confidence in Boris Johnson.The relationship between Johnson and Ross is fundamental to the fight for Scotland to remain in the Union, and it is now at its nadir.The Conservative bible, The Spectator magazine, asks this week on its front page, simply: ‘Is it over ’The veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale has dubbed Boris Johnson a ‘dead man walking’.In contrast, the Prime Minister’s Cabinet colleagues Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Nadine Dorries and others attempted to rally the troops in support of their beleaguered general in the House of Commons tea rooms and on MPs’ WhatsApp groups.The Prime Minister remains in serious political danger.More evidence — perhaps photographs of Boris Johnson at the party — will most likely emerge by the weekend.It is clear these leaks and this campaign are co-ordinated by the Prime Minister’s political enemies, who are media savvy and possess a laser-like focus on their goal.Boris Johnson is — just about — still the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. The most powerful woman, now, is the former landlady of The Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, the senior civil servant Sue Gray.The question of whether she will call time on the Prime Minister’s career will be answered in the coming days.Peter Cardwell is a former special adviser to four Cabinet ministers, the Political Editor of talkRADIO and the author of The Secret Le of Special AdvisersRelated topicsBoris JohnsonMore On Boris JohnsonDaughter of Prof Jim Dornan joins growing number of people calling for Boris Johnson to resign PremiumAlliance councillor Michelle Kelly ‘sickened’ by Boris Johnson’s party after she suffered traumatic lockdown birth PremiumMark BainOpinionBoris Johnson apology: PM cut the figure of a man who knows he let country down over party PremiumNI’s Westminster parties voice opposition to planned MP pay riseBoris Johnson should resign over Downing Street party, claims Doug Beattie – while Sammy Wilson says PM must ‘come clean’Most ReadTeacher Ashling Murphy killed by stranger during random attack on jogging route in Co OffalyStormont department facing ‘economic disaster’ after losing £m in EU fundingWatch: ‘Traumatised’ -year-old girl escapes car stolen from south Belfast petrol stationThree horses killed after animals on loose at Belfast International AirportIn pictures: Larne and Linfield supporters pack out Seaview for County Antrim Shield finalTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlay‘No stone will be left unturned’ in Offaly murder investigation, say gardaiPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandEx-Paralympic athlete jailed after airliner climate protest awaits appeal rulingPublic do not accept PM’s claim that gathering was ‘work event’ – GivanGivan hopeful that ministers will move to relax NI Covid rules next weekExecutive approves £m scheme to help with energy billsBoris Johnson to chair council of UK’s devolved administration leadersLatestVeteran welcomes end of ‘not fit to serve’ Andrew’s honorary military rolesAlec Baldwin has not ‘turned over’ his phone to US authoritiesHome Secretary warns there will be more agents like Chinese spy Christine LeeTwo arrested over fatal shooting in DublinPolice focus on mountain bike as man quizzed over killing of Ashling Murphy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

style as queen removes his military roles and patronages","story":"The Duke of York will not use his HRH tile  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Duke of York will not use his HRH tile By Tony Jones and Laura Elston, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Duke of York’s status as a member of the royal family is in tatters after the Queen stripped him of his honorary military roles and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case.The move is a humiliation for Andrew and comes after the lawsuit against him took a major step forward on Wednesday when a judge threw out the duke’s motion to dismiss the sexual assault case and ruled it can go to trial.Andrew, who was born an HRH, will not use it any official capacity, a royal source said and the duke has also been stripped of his remaining royal patronages.The move represents the duke’s complete removal from official royal le, and an attempt to distance the monarchy from Andrew, who was once second in line to the throne as the spare to the heir, in the year of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.It comes after more than  veterans joined forces to express their outrage, writing to the Queen to demand the duke’s removal from the honorary military positions.Accusing Andrew of bringing the services he is associated with into disrepute, the  former members of the Royal Navy, RAF and Army said that “were this any other senior military officer it is inconceivable that he would still be in post”.Royal author Penny Junor questioned whether the Queen should have insisted the titles and patronages be ed sooner: “I think it was a huge embarrassment that retired serving military personnel were demanding that titles be removed.“That just becomes embarrassing and it becomes damaging to the Queen because the Queen is then seen as protecting her son.”A statement from Buckingham Palace regarding The Duke of York: pic OCeSqzCP— The Royal FamilyJanuary , She added: “I don’t knowthe Queen was too slow to take them back or whether it lies with Andrew who was too slow to offer them back.“But either way I think actually a bit of criticism has to fall on the Queen here, becauseAndrew was not offering them up she, or her advisers should have seen that this was going to cause a problem and should have insisted that she take them back.”A royal source said the issue had been widely discussed with the royal family, making it likely that the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge were involved in crisis talks over the matter.Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Thursday: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been ed to the Queen.“The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming faa .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_feaf-a-c-c-bbbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming

would be redistributed to other members of the royal family.The Queen is head of the armed forces and honorary military appointments are in her gt.The Palace said previously that the duke’s military appointments were in abeyance after he stepped down from public duties in  after his disastrous Newsnight interview.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP w

Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the duke when she was  and a minor under US law.The duke has strenuously denied the allegations.A source close to the duke said he would “continue to defend himself” against Ms Giuffre’s allegations following the judge’s decision to dismiss his legal team’s attempt to have the case thrown out.The source said: “Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling.“However, it was not a judgment on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s allegations.“This is a marathon not a sprint and the duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.”Andrew’s other honorary military titles were: Honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth Colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment Colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm Royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers Deputy colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancersand Royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

Some of them had become entangled with barbed wire as they crashed through fencing.He described the next half-hour alone in the cold, swirling flood waters as ldquosome wrestling match.

My name is actually Bojak Johnkovic the world famous tennis player. So the rules don’t apply to me.. The party at Number  was not a party. It was a republican funeral, so the rules didn’t apply to this event.. I was not at the party. I sent a lookalike with a wig. At the time of the partyI was actually in flagrante with a lady friend who is not my we. . I didn’t intend to be at the party. I was only in the garden at Number  because Carrie and I had the decorators in. And when you’re spending £, on a bit of painting and decorating you’d best stay out of their way. . Alright yes, I was at the party but Sammy Wilson and Paul Frew told me it was safe and they are world renowned experts on virology.. Yes I was at the party but I didn’t organise it. In fact I was the one who stopped them hiring Van Morrison to do the cabaret. . Wibble wibble, whf waff, vaccine roll out, carpe diem, Diocletian, I got Brexit done, fancy a wee tete a tete on the terrace Sue  Bring your own wine. Ok how about a PPE contract would that shut you up • I am part of the Elite Nationalist Network – and Kate has sussed usAt the risk of annoying Kate Hoey, I wish to confess to you my readers that many years ago I used to be in the legal profession. Having driven the united Ireland agenda as far as I could by being a third rate lawyer I then became involved in the media and now look at me! Yes I admit it. I am a fully paid up member of the Elite Nationalist Network. Kate has sussed us out. She has uncovered the ENN conspiracy. We Tims are busy infiltrating everywhere in our typically sly unreformed papist way. Like every other Catholic, ex-Catholic, lapsed Catholic or person with a vaguely Catholic sounding name, I can’t and don’t think for myself. I am simply a deep undercover proto-Shinner whose sole aim in le is to destroy Ulster. I shouldn’t really be telling you this, but the Elite Nationalist Network meets every second Thursday after Mass. We meet in Joe Brolly’s house, or the nearest GAA hall. All discussions are held in Irish in case Ben Lowry is eavesdropping. We first of all discuss how Celtic are doing, debate which fish is best for Friday dinner, sing Amhran na bhFiann, say a quick decade of the Rosary and then we Zoom link up with our paymasters in Dublin and Rome who give us our orders.For instance last year His Holiness Pope Francis himself gave me my secret Elite Nationalist Network mission. He commanded me to infiltrate the traditional unionist media by having a column in the News Letter.This week at ENN, we discussed how to fatally undermine the link between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. After much debate we decided that the best way to sabotage the Union was just to let Kate Hoey, Jamie Bryson and Jim Allister get on with what they are doing. So we agreed to do nothing. Typical lazy fenians. Honestly, it’s a wonder we were able to become the Elite.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

Billy Hutchinson is the only remaining PUP representative in Belfast council.John Kyle has been a Belfast councillor since  when he was co-opted following the death of former party leader David Ervine.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCulture minister Chris Philp told MPs there are a “number of areas” where the Online Safety Bill can be “improved substantially”, with a revised piece of legislation expected in the coming months.His remarks came as MPs debated a report by the Joint Committee on the Draft Online Safety Bill, which said more offences needed to be covered.These included paid-for scam and fraudulent advertising, cyber flashing, content promoting self-harm and the deliberate sending of flashing images to people with photosensitive epilepsy.The Bill must also be clearer about what is specically illegal online and proposed that pornography sites should have a legal duty to keep children off them regardless of whether they host user-to-user content, the report added among other recommendations.The legislation is expected to force the biggest operators, such as Meta – formerly Facebook – and Google, to abide by a duty of care to users, overseen by Ofcom as the new regulator for the sector.Concluding a Commons debate, Mr Philp said: “We understand there are a number of areas where this Bill can be improved substantially.“The Government certainly has no monopoly on wisdom and we certainly intend to profit from the huge experience of the members of the committees and this House in making signicant improvements to this Bill and it is our intention to introduce a revised and updated Bill before the end of the current session.”Mr Philp added: “I’m not going to be pre-announcing any firm commitments today because work is still ongoing, including the collective agreement process in government.“But on fraud and paid-for advertising, we have heard the message of the joint committee, the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial services sector, campaigners, members of this House … it is a message that the Government has absolutely heard and it’s something we very much hope we will be able to address when we bring forward the Bill, but I can’t make any specic commitments because the work is still ongoing.”.removeHe added the message has also been heard on the Law Commission’s work on communications offences that will “really tighten up some of the issues to do with what are essentially malicious or harmful communications, issues like cyber flashing and the issues to do with epilepsy”.Mr Philp went on: “We’re studying those Law Commission proposals very positively and very carefully, as the joint committee recommended that we do.“We have also heard very clearly the messages concerning commercial pornography.“We understand the issues presented by the fact the Bill as drafted does not cover that and again that is something we’re currently working on very, very hard indeed.”Mr Philp said the Government is also examining calls for users to be able to choose to protect themselves from anonymous content.Earlier, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouseshared her concern that perpetrators of cyber flashing were often able to get away with it and not face consequences.She said: “Cyber flashing is a particularly prevalent form of online violence against women and disproportionately affects young women and girls – % of girls aged  to , and % of all women have reported being sent unsolicited penis images.“Like real le flashing, cyber flashing can frighten, it can humiliate, it can violate boundaries, it is a form of sexual harassment from which even the physical boundaries of a home offer no respite.”Urging the Government to close a “loophole” in the law, she added: “All too often the trauma they experience is trivialised.”Conservative former culture minister Matt Warman agreed, saying: “Flashing is illegal in the real world, the idea that it might not be illegal online is absurd. We shouldn’t even be having that conversation.“There are a huge number of pieces of this Bill where in fact it is simply a tidying up exercise that our legislation has not kept pace with the changing nature of the digital world.”He added there was often an issue of the “resources police allocate to online crime”, with online crime often “treated fundamentally dferently”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uSignicant improvements u to be made to proposed online safety laws, MPs told article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
