[{"url":null,"title":"Johnny Depp insists not grabbed Amber Heard head","story":"Share this article \u0027I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him.  \u0027The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.\u0027Stranger Things actress Ryder was in a relationship with Depp during the early 1990s, and he famously tattooed \u0027Winona Forever\u0027 on his arm – before changing it to \u0027Wino Forever\u0027 following their split.What Depp is being questioned about at the High Court during the libel caseDepp has been questioned since Tuesday over 14 alleged domestic violence incidents, and his Hollywood lifestyle, past relationships with Ryder, Vanessa Paradis and Kate Moss, and his well-documented use of drink and drugs. The court has heard disputed accounts of a three-day trip to Australia, when Depp lost the top of his middle finger, and the so-called \u0027defecation incident\u0027 in which faeces were found in the couple\u0027s bed after Heard\u0027s 30th birthday.Depp finished giving evidence today after around 25 hours in the witness box at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. NGN\u0027s lawyers have said Depp first hit his ex-wife in early 2013 during a heated argument over a painting - which he allegedly tried to set alight - by Heard\u0027s ex Tasya van Ree and attacked her on a number of other occasions before the couple split in May 2016.The publisher claims Depp is a \u0027Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u0027 character who snapped when he was drunk and on drugs and turned into \u0027the Monster\u0027 - an \u0027alter ego\u0027 he assumed when he would \u0027lose control and become a violent thug\u0027.The Pirates Of The Caribbean star has admitted giving misleading evidence about his drink and drug use before a flight from Boston to LA in May 2014 and \u0027accidentally\u0027 headbutting Heard during a row at their home in December 2015, but says his ex-wife\u0027s allegations are \u0027complete lies\u0027 and that she was \u0027the abuser\u0027 in the relationship.He accuses Heard of severing the top of his middle finger with a vodka bottle in Australia in March 2015 and of \u0027building a dossier very early on\u0027 in their relationship to align herself with the #MeToo movement.The court also heard evidence last week on Friday afternoon from LAPD officer Melissa Saenz who attended the couple\u0027s penthouse after the actor allegedly hit Heard in the face with her own mobile phone in May 2016, who said she \u0027did not see any injuries\u0027 or damage to the apartment.Paradis, 47, and Ryder, 48, were originally due to give evidence this week, as was alleged Harvey Weinstein victim Katherine Kendall, 50, who accuses Mr Wootton of \u0027deliberately misusing\u0027 her quotes and \u0027using the #MeToo movement\u0027 to damage Depp.Heard\u0027s evidence was expected to begin on Friday morning - but it is not clear when the Aquaman actress will give evidence as Depp\u0027s cross-examination has taken almost two days longer than scheduled.The three-week trial, which is due to finish on July 27, will also hear evidence from current and former employees of Depp and Heard, as well as her sister and friends by video-link from LA.The actor is suing NGN and Mr Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018 with the headline: \u0027Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?\u0027NGN is defending the article as true, and says Depp was \u0027controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Is bird GOAT Photographers photo kookaburra people seeing TWO animals","story":"Share this article \u0027When I am out photographing birds, I do actually talk to them, if there\u0027s no one around I\u0027m definitely talking to the birds.\u0027Even this kookaburra here I was talking, I just see what they do and see if they look at me because it can make a better photo.\u0027I tell my mates I can talk magpie, which of course I can\u0027t.\u0027David, who lives with his wife Rosie and their five children, said he\u0027s just very happy people enjoy his photos and he\u0027s found that people like the images with some action or something unusual.He said: \u0027I love taking images of animals with character in their faces, and this time it was two animals for the price of one.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Start recovery UK economy grew 1 8 cent May","story":"Share this article Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, he outlined the \u0027exceptional economic shock\u0027 the UK had suffered during the pandemic.\u0027The global financial crisis saw GDP fall by around 5 per cent at its trough.

It is unclear if it was triggered by the coronavirus.The baby was also large for her age, a complication of her mother\u0027s diabetes during pregnancy.At first she appeared healthy — other than being premature, when she was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit.But doctors were aware she could have been exposed to the coronavirus, which is scientifically called SARS-CoV-2, via her mother. On the day after she was born, medics discovered her vitals had changed. She had mild difficulties breathing as well as a fever. The doctors said it was unlikely that the respiratory distress was due to the fact she had been born premature, considering it did not start for 24 hours. She tested positive for the coronavirus and was treated with supplemental oxygen for several days but did not need mechanical ventilation. Covid-19 tests remained positive for up to 14 days. At 21 days, the mother and infant were sent home in good condition. The researchers examined the placenta, which showed signs of tissue inflammation. They also found the specific coronavirus proteins in the cells of the placenta.Together, these findings \u0027strongly suggest\u0027 that the infection was transmitted in the womb, rather than during or after birth, doctors said. This is medically called \u0027utero transmission\u0027, and experts have said the passing of the coronavirus this was was probable for some time.\u0027We wanted to be very careful of our interpretation of this data, but now is an even more important time for pregnant women to protect themselves from Covid-19,\u0027 Dr Evans said.  The report, led by Dr Julide Sisman, detailed two other cases of \u0027vertical transmission\u0027 of the coronavirus, which is when it would pass immediately before or after birth and not in the wombThe authors said it is difficult to determine at which point a baby with the coronavirus picked it up.The new case report is the \u0027strongest evidence to date\u0027 that uterine transmission is possible, the press release from journal publishers Wolters Kluwer said.It follows a small study in Italy which also found pregnant woman infected with the coronavirus may be able to spread it to unborn babies.Researchers studied 31 women with Covid-19, who gave birth between March and April. Two babies tested positive for the virus.They found signs of the coronavirus in several samples of umbilical cord blood, the placenta and, in one case, breast milk.In one case, \u0027there\u0027s strong evidence suggesting that the newborn was born already positive because we found the virus in the umbilical cord blood and in the placenta,\u0027 said study leader, Dr Claudio Fenizia, an immunology specialist at the University of Milan.However, he said women shouldn\u0027t panic because the virus detected in the placenta and other areas isn\u0027t necessarily viable - in other words \u0027catching\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s too early to make guidelines,\u0027 Dr Fenizia said at an online medical conference, according to the news agency AP."},{"url":null,"title":"Huawei UK chairman resign ministers prepare announce 5G ban","story":"Share this article The decision to exclude Huawei from the 5G network will lead to a further deterioration in relations between the UK and China, with tensions already strained because of coronavirus and a row over the imposition of a new national security law on Hong Kong. Mr Dowden told MPs that the Government is \u0027clear eyed\u0027 on its approach to China and that \u0027what we want is a modern and mature relationship with China based on mutual respect\u0027. Ed Brewster, a spokesman for Huawei UK, said: \u0027This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. \u0027Instead of \u0027levelling up\u0027 the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider.  \u0027We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK. \u0027Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicised, this is about US trade policy and not security.\u0027Arun Bansal, president of Europe and Latin America for Ericsson said the decision \u0027removes the uncertainty that was slowing down investment decisions around the deployment of 5G in the UK\u0027.The National Cyber Security Centre\u0027s technical director Ian Levy said today\u0027s decision is \u0027necessary for the long-term security and resilience of the UK networks\u0027 but that the move comes with \u0027significant risks and costs\u0027.\u0027The long-term health and ersity of supply in the telecoms sector is a critical issue for all, and it will take concerted, sustained, international effort to fix it,\u0027 he said. The Government has faced fierce pressure from Tory MPs for months to rethink its decision in January to grant Huawei a role in the 5G network.And while today\u0027s move was welcomed, Conservative backbenchers said ministers needed to go further and faster as they questioned why Huawei\u0027s 3G and 4G technology was being allowed to remain in place. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the seven year deadline for the removal of Huawei 5G technology should be brought forward to five years as he said there is \u0027no reason why\u0027 action could not be speeded up. He added: \u0027Having said he is getting rid of them in 5G, 4G and 3G Huawei apparently are fine and they can go on for as long as anyone and they will be upgraded in software upgrades for the next decade. \u0027If they are a risk in 5G why are they not a risk to us generally?\u0027 Tory backbencher Bob Seely, the co-ordinator of the 60-strong Huawei Interest Group of Conservative MPs - said the move by ministers is a \u0027good first decision\u0027 but expressed concerns about the pace of plans to remove equipment. \u0027I believe that MPs will have concerns about elements of the statement, including no ban on 3G and 4G and a rip-out date for 5G far into the distance,\u0027 he said in a statement.\u0027It does mean Huawei\u0027s glide path out of our critical national infrastructure will be slow. It also means that BT and others could be installing already-bought Huawei kit for well after 2020.\u0027Huawei is, by Government\u0027s own definition, a high-risk vendor.

Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better.

On Friday, Boris Johnson wore a mask in public and discussed the possibility of them becoming compulsory, before Michael Gove denied this was the plan on Sunday.But 48 hours later Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, confirmed in a Commons statement that shoppers would be required to wear face coverings in England with legislation coming into force on Friday 24 July.Face coverings became a requirement on public transport in England on 15 June.Captioned “If you don’t mask - you don’t get”, the Banksy video is the first new post by the artist since early June when he responded to the statue of Edward Colston being removed and thrown into the harbour in his home town of Bristol.“What should we do with the empty plinth in the middle of Bristol?” he asked, before offering a solution. “We drag him out the water, put him back on the plinth, tie cable round his neck and commission some life size bronze statues of protesters in the act of pulling him down. Everyone happy. A famous day commemorated.”In April, Banksy released artwork created during lockdown with a series of rats causing mayhem in his bathroom, which was posted on Instagram and captioned “My wife hates it when I work from home”.Before that he created a piece in Bristol, which was later vandalised. The words “BCC wankers” was scrawled across the artwork, which was created in February and featured a girl firing a catapult filled with flowers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0411308a3798d42993b5f6480640b35b93691a5/0_118_3142_1886/master/3142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfa01ac6baf86e149220ff6c12a569f","title":"next generation magnum photographers","story":"From crime-scene torsos to the tension of a chess game – this new wave of photographic talent set out their vision"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaf27ed2cf9de14626d38313034ef22f7b8fed2/0_349_5430_3258/master/5430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8973fb6dcad6999e0b085ffede77140","title":"nsw on extra high alert for covid 19 resurgence as hotel crackdown announced","story":"Premier Gladys Berejiklian details stricter regime for pubs as cluster linked to the Crossroads Hotel grows to 30 casesNew South Wales is on “extra high alert” for a widespread Covid-19 resurgence and will require so-called hygiene marshals to enforce social distancing at every pub in the state.The crackdown comes after patrons who visited a Sydney hotel at the centre of the state’s largest outbreak expressed concern over relaxed safety practices and the pub’s manager conceded more could have been done to record visitors’ contact details.The cluster linked to the Crossroads Hotel in Casula grew to 30 cases on Tuesday evening, as the Queensland government declared the neighbouring suburbs of Liverpool and Campbelltown to be Covid-19 hotspots, and barred residents from entering the state.The NRL told players in NSW and the ACT to reenter strict biosecurity bubbles after an emergency meeting about the resurgence of Covid-19 in the state while the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, announced that plans to ease restrictions for travellers from NSW and the ACT next week would be abandoned.The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said in response to the outbreak there would now be a limit of 300 people in pubs and hotels and group bookings would be capped at 10 people down from 20.“We need to take some further action to curtail some of that high-risk activity,” the premier said on Tuesday.Under the new rules, venues with a capacity of more than 250 people will be required to have a full-time marshal on-site to enforce Covid-19 safety guidelines, while those with a capacity of less than 250 will have a marshal during peak lunch and dinner periods.Hotels will be forced to create a digital record of patron names and phone numbers, either as an Excel or Word document, and submit it to authorities within 24 hours.It will also be mandatory for pubs and hotels to download and register the Covid-19 safe plan and take down contact details of all patrons.The changes – which don’t apply to clubs, restaurants or the Star casino – will come into effect from 12.01am on Friday.The crackdown came as police announced a Jindabyne hotel had become the first licensed premises in NSW to be shut down, for 72 hours, over breaches of public health and safety. It was also fined $5,000.Officers had issued warnings over “large groups of people failing to social distance”.Berejiklian on Tuesday noted the state was on “extra high alert” about the threat of Victorian cases creating multiple clusters in NSW, with 14 of the cases linked to Crossroads being close contacts who hadn’t themselves visited the pub.Many patrons who attended the hotel between 3 July and 10 July and are now self-isolating, have since expressed concern, claiming they were not asked to write down their contact details at any point during their visit.“I was there on the Sunday night (5 July) about 5pm (and) there was no login. I walked straight in, ordered a meal, sat down and left,” one patron said.“It was like walking into a pub pre-Covid,” another visitor said.Chelsea Sarkis said her details were taken when she made a reservation but she was surprised at the number of people at the venue on Saturday, 4 July.“The first thing we thought was there were way too many people here,” she said.Jason Marlow, the manager of the Marlow Hotel group that owns the Crossroads Hotel, defended the venue, saying it had “always followed the Covid-19 management plan including social distancing measures, staff training and a strict cleaning regime” and “there has never been a capacity breach at the venue”.On Tuesday evening, Marlow conceded contact data recording could be more thorough, telling  Australia “we are now changing our system to having licence scanning equipment at all the points of entry to the Crossroads”.The hotel remains closed with a pop-up testing clinic operating out of its car park.Two additional cases were announced on Tuesday evening with two men in their 20s who attended the Planet Fitness gym at Casula testing positive for Covid-19.A confirmed case from the Crossroads Hotel had visited the facility. NSW Health has now directed anyone who attended the gym between 4-10 July to self-isolate.One of the cases linked to the hotel visited the Prestons Lodge Advantaged Care nursing home, which has now been placed into lockdown.Another case worked at the Kmart store in Casula Mall on 10 July. A case confirmed on Monday that was linked to Crossroads Hotel also visited the Star casino in Sydney on 4 July.The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said other venues across Sydney may have been exposed to the virus between 27 June and 10 July after visits from people linked to the outbreak.These include Picton Hotel, Canterbury Leagues Club, Narellan Town Centre and Zone Bowling in Villawood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ad95eaea4b321e88093e6561092b57774009a9/0_58_1132_679/master/1132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d571301e0fdfe23de7692e47d5b45539","title":"former barclays boss apologises for amanda staveley tart reference","story":"Roger Jenkins made comments during 2008 crisis negotiations with investors, court toldA former Barclays executive has apologised in court for calling financier Amanda Staveley a “tart” and a “dolly bird” during negotiations over an emergency cash call during the 2008 financial crisis.Roger Jenkins, Barclays’ investment banking chief during the crisis, on Tuesday told the judge in high court that he apologised, during questions in a £1.5bn legal action against Barclays.Staveley is suing Barclays after her client, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, invested £3.25bn as part of emergency fundraising as the bank scrambled to avoid a UK government bailout.PCP Capital Partners, the investment company run by Staveley, claims Barclays made a secret side deal with Qatari investors that meant that PCP lost out on much higher fees than the £30m it actually received. Barclays has described the case as “opportunistic and speculative”.Staveley recently brokered the potential takeover of the Premier League football club Newcastle United.Jenkins was at the time one of the highest-paid bankers in the UK, arranging financing for large companies, and was known as “big dog” by some colleagues. The high court also heard last week that Jenkins joked about giving a colleague cocaine.The sexist terms were used in a telephone conversation recorded in October 2008 between Jenkins and Richard Boath, the bank’s former head of European financial institutions ision.“Now that dolly bird … that represents – is it – what’s her name?” Boath asked, according to the transcript. “Amanda Staveley,” Jenkins said. Jenkins later added: “I can handle dolly birds.”Later in the call, Jenkins had said: “Well I am - you know, I’m going to call the tart I was going to call the tart.” Boath asked: “Who’s the tart?” Jenkins replied: “Amanda.”Jenkins was asked on Tuesday about his use of the word “tart” by a lawyer representing PCP.“I apologise for that,” he said. He indicated that he had apologised to Ms Staveley before. Staveley was in court to hear his apology.The comments by Jenkins and Boath were not the only instance of derogatory comments uncovered during the trial. Another former Barclays executive, Stephen Jones, last month resigned as chief executive of the banking lobby group UK Finance after it emerged that he had called Staveley’s firm “fuckers” and “scumbags”.Barclays declined to comment on Jenkins’ remarks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e120ed9ba9bd105b66b43d57058d864dc07c97/0_27_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc32269fb3ae6caf64e5453010f7259","title":"obr publish three covid 19 forecasts for the uk economy","story":"Worst-case scenario warns output may not rise to pre-pandemic levels until 2024 The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s official forecaster, has published three possible scenarios for the UK economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic:Activity rebounds relatively quickly, similar to the OBR’s central scenario published in April during the early stages of the Covid-19 emergency.

The government should be seizing this opportunity and taking action to rid these factories and many other workplaces around the country of exploitation.Instead, the weekend brought us reports of Priti Patel comparing the situation in Leicester to the Rotherham grooming scandal, suggesting that “cultural sensitivities” were the reason why the endemic abuse had not been tackled. This sounds like an attempt to distract us from the policy failures that have led us here, to a country in which more than 10,000 potential victims of modern slavery were identified in 2019, and everyday products have exploitation in their supply chains.Employers push abusive working conditions on to workers for one very simple reason: to make more money. In this way, it’s an opportunistic act. So, very simply, we need to remove the opportunity. How do we do that? There are three clear ways: properly funded labour inspection, ensuring reporting abuse is safe for migrant workers, and strong unionisation. None of them involve cultural sensitivities, and government has been asked for them repeatedly over the years.We can’t expect to have decent workplaces without proper enforcement of our labour laws. For too long, labour inspection has been portrayed as busybody interference or “red tape”. This narrative allows government to get away with shameful underfunding of our inspectorates. The stats say it all: the likelihood of a minimum wage inspection by HMRC for an average employer is once every 500 years. The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, our foremost agency tasked with tackling precisely the kinds of conditions reported in Leicester, has just over 100 staff to cover the entire labour market of England and Wales. Labour inspectors weren’t even named as “essential workers” on government lists when the pandemic took hold. They’re treated as the poor relation of policing, and yet without them to hold the line, labour abuses escalate into full-blown modern slavery. For government to point the finger at these frontline services for the situation in Leicester is, at best, ignorance of the facts, and, at worst, offensive to these underfunded agencies.Finally, the most effective defenders of workplace rights are workers themselves. We’ve become inured to the decline of unions, and yet Covid-19 demonstrates their importance: without them ensuring that health and safety rules – like social distancing and PPE – are observed, this job is left to business. Brands do have the power to ensure unionisation in their supply chains, just like they have the power to impose such low prices for orders that necessitate poverty wages, but they don’t use it. Boohoo was outed during a 2019 parliamentary inquiry for refusing “even the most basic level of engagement” with the union Usdaw, and for being generally hostile to workers organising for their rights. If the government really wants to avoid more lockdowns and more exploitation, it should mandate unionisation in high-risk sectors.Properly funded labour inspection, ensuring reporting abuse is safe for migrant workers, and strong unionisation are the foundations of a decent and healthy labour market. Without them in place, we’ll continue to have the kind of appalling situation exposed in Leicester. The health of our workplaces and communities requires us not to be distracted by red herring explanations but to keep calling for a post-Covid-19 future that puts these foundations firmly in place at last.• Emily Kenway is senior adviser at Focus on Labour Exploitation and author of The Truth about Modern Slavery, published in January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ceb015d65326dac24833061009db31042c1993/0_284_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0137d769ff86c263ad647cb37a4a90c5","title":"huge atlas statue to guard sicilys temple of zeus once more","story":"Eight-metre statue built in 5th century BC had been buried among ancient ruinsA colossal statue of Atlas, buried for centuries among ancient ruins, will soon take its rightful place among the ancient Greek temples of Agrigento on Sicily.The city’s archaeological park announced that the artwork, one of the most celebrated sculptures on the island, will be raised upright in front of the Temple of Zeus.In Greek mythology, Atlas was a Titan or god who was forced to bear the sky on his shoulders after being defeated by Zeus, one of the next generation of gods called Olympians.The statue, eight metres high and built in the 5th century BC, was one of nearly 40 that adorned the ancient building, considered the largest Doric temple ever built, even if it was never completed and now lies in ruins.Archaeologists and architects will soon start work to raise the statue in Sicily’s Valley of the Temples on the occasion of the founding of the ancient city of Akragas (now Agrigento) 2,600 years ago.It was one of the leading population centres in the region during the golden age of Ancient Greece and holds seven well-preserved Greek temples.Built on a high ridge over a  of 100 years, they remain among the most magnificent examples of Greek architecture. In the 5th century, more than 100,000 people lived there and, according to the philosopher Empedocles, they would “party as if they’ll die tomorrow, and build as if they will live for ever”.The city was destroyed in 406 BC by the Carthaginians, and its prosperity did not return until the rise of Timoleon in the late third century BC. During the Punic wars, the Carthaginians defended the settlement against the Romans, who seized control of the city in 210 BC.\u2028During the Roman era, the city – renamed Agrigentum (subsequently known as Girgenti) – underwent a period of monumental urban redevelopment with new public buildings, including at least two temples.Over the centuries, brickwork from the old monuments of the ancient city was taken for use in the construction of the buildings around Girgenti and the ancient harbour of Porto Empedocle.\u2028Historians also maintained that the Temple of Zeus was never finished because it was still lacking a roof when Akragas was conquered by the Carthaginians.\u2028\u2028Outside the temple, huge statues of Atlas were frozen in the act of supporting the temple.\u2028“The idea is to reposition one of these Atlases in front of the temple,” says Sciarratta, “so that it may serve as a  of the structure dedicated to the father of the gods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1238723c84967cb47c80691998b028c523ef2622/0_338_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b05f40617dcee4c1c5f08c25c16dc61","title":"farmers wildeast hatch plan return area size dorset wild nature east anglia","story":"WildEast aims to convince farmers, councils and others across East Anglia to pledge land to wildlifeReturning an area the size of Dorset to wild nature, reintroducing extinct lynx, pelicans and beavers and championing regenerative farming to restore soil health are the radical aims of a new charitable foundation.But the most revolutionary feature of WildEast may be that it is founded by three farmers in the most intensively farmed region of Britain.Hugh Somerleyton, Argus Hardy and Olly Birkbeck, who own more than 3,200 hectares (8,000 acres) on their family farms in Suffolk and Norfolk, are seeking to persuade farmers and also councils, businesses, schools and ordinary people across East Anglia to pledge a fifth of their land to wildlife.WildEast aims to dedicate 250,000 hectares of East Anglia to wildlife over the next 50 years while also working with schools to enhance children’s knowledge of farming and wildlife and creating an accreditation system to boost wildlife-friendly farmers.WildEast has already gathered support from farmers of all sizes from across East Anglia including vicars, teachers, grassroots conservation projects and industrial estate owners.Somerleyton said farmers had remained relatively unscathed while manufacturing endured huge upheavals in recent decades. “We’ve been driving around in Range Rovers and going on skiing holidays. In East Anglia it’s been very rewarding being in agriculture. I sound like I’m biting the hand that feeds me but we have been very protected from the troubles of other industries. The awful thing is that protection, not deliberately, has accelerated nature decline. Farmers have become pretty grant-dependent. This movement is about trying to move the needle.”Hardy said WildEast was not about chastising farmers but seeking nature restoration in “churchyards, barnyards and backyards” and nurturing dialogue and change across society, including consumers who buy cheap meat that is farmed indoors. Britain slaughters nearly 1 billion chickens each year.Hardy said: “There’s a lot of blame put on farmers. They are seen as the people who need to make the change. WildEast is about broadening the focus – it’s about all of us, our gardens, how people are eating, what people are eating, and local food markets.”Restoring wildlife is “not stopping farming, it’s fitting farming systems into natural systems so we can restore bioersity”, added Hardy. “It’s not rewilding, it’s making things wilder – not to create space for nature but to find out how we live inside the ecosystem. We don’t want anyone to visit a nature reserve, we want you to live in one.”Despite being a sheep farmer, Hardy said he would be happy to farm alongside reintroduced lynx. “We have to accept what’s here and what was here,” he said. “Far more sheep are killed by parasites than lynx, where they are present in natural ecosystems. Worms are a much greater threat.”According to Somerleyton, many farmers have been inspired by Isabella Tree’s book Wilding, which tells how she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, returned Knepp, their 1,400-hectare farm to nature, farming organic meat from free-ranging deer, cows and pigs.Although their West Sussex farm has since benefited from a surge in tourism, Somerleyton said the Knepp model was not applicable to every farmer.Somerleyton, who founded the restaurant chain Dish Dash before returning to his family estate, said he was “very aware” that smaller farmers did not share his willingness to devote large tracts of less fertile soils to wildlife, or ersify his income with tourism and gastropubs, but said a region-wide WildEast accreditation system could help small, eco-friendly producers.WildEast hopes that its new accreditation system will help East Anglian farmers using restorative agriculture – with long rotations that revive soil and micro-organisms – or high-welfare, natural outdoor grazing find markets and obtain higher prices for their food.Somerleyton said there had been “a lot of head-scratching” by farmers responding to WildEast. According to Hardy, who is also an architect, many have a cautious attitude of “we’ll just watch and see what comes out of your harvest”.But Birkbeck, who has restored a 200-hectare heathland that was ploughed up during the second world war on his west Norfolk farm, said a younger generation of farmers was increasingly aware that they needed to move away from chemical-dependent farming, with protection for soils and predatory insects that regulate pests.He said: “Farmers are beginning to realise that they have a moral duty to protect the countryside that they are dependent on – that we have to work with nature rather than shut it out, because it will find you out in the end. We’ve tidied nature up and swept it away in the last 40 years. If we can only get back to accepting mess again we’d be getting somewhere. We’ve started WildEast to make that conversation public.”WildEast supporters include the Chet Valley B-line, a more than 10-mile (17km) corridor of pollinator-friendly habitat, and the Suffolk pig farmers Dingley Dell, who sow wildflower strips alongside their outdoor pig pens, creating a habitat for more than a million bees. “Get 1,000 people to do that and it’s a billion-bee project,” said Hardy.WildEast is also devising an education programme for interested schools, and is encouraging dialogue via #mywildeast on social media, even producing a TikTok video.“We’re trying to reach out on various platforms, however clumsily,” said Hardy. “It’s not about rewilding nature, it’s about rewilding ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954933f65e4d3122c4fc967de0f942ce7a89f701/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfff7c1399cb883385118cb2b85a67a","title":"what tattoo are you planning on getting post lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from people who are looking at getting a new tattoo and the reasons behind itWith tattoo parlours in England able to reopen from 13 July we would like to know what tattoos people will be getting post-lockdown.What design are you getting and why?

Email feast@theI love Thai and Vietnamese curries, but is it  worth making the curry paste from scratch? And what’s the secret to a great one? Adam, London SE10When faced with a cooking conundrum, I often ask: “What would Nigel Slater do?” In this instance, he mixes his own green curry paste: “I like the vibrancy that comes from the freshly-blitzed lemongrass, ginger, garlic and coriander leaves,” to which he then adds shrimp paste, fish sauce and a pinch of sugar. For red curry paste, Slater turns to shop-bought, finding them hotter and the sourness “more pronounced” than his homemade efforts.The beauty of making your own, however, says Thuy Diem Pham, chefowner of The Little Viet Kitchen in London, is that you can tailor it to your own taste. “I’m from the south of Vietnam, and every household has their own recipe, using ingredients their family likes. If you buy it, you can’t do that.” For hers, she crushes lemongrass, galangal, red shallots, fresh ginger, chillies, shrimp paste, dried turmeric, coriander seeds and cumin, it keeps for four weeks in an airtight jar in the fridge.A granite pestle and mortar will make all the difference to the texture. As chef Sebby Holmes, author of new book Thai in 7, puts it: “A proper Thai curry is made with brute force.” Diem Pham agrees: “Don’t change tradition unnecessarily – you’ll see the colour and flavours alter as you crush more chillies and shallots.” Using a food processor isn’t the end of the world, though, she says – just don’t tell her mum.Chillies are always the starting point, and the type of chilli depends on what you’re making: dried, long red ones for red-curry paste, fresh green bird’s eye chillies for green. Dried chillies, Holmes explains, should be soaked, then charred in a wok to “take the edge off”, before removing the seeds. He then adds one ingredient at a time: “Get the chillies to a paste, scoop out, and go through your hardy ingredients – galangal, lemongrass, krachai (wild ginger) – before adding fresh chilli, coriander root and, finally, the spices (cumin, coriander seeds, white peppercorns).” The key, he says, is to pound, pound, pound: “You want to keep going until you think it’s done, and then go some more.”When it comes to cooking, Diem Pham scoops out two tablespoons of paste and adds coconut cream, followed by vegetables, tofu or chicken. For Holmes, it’s a tale of two halves: “Prepare your meat so it’s delicious on its own, then make the curry as good as you can, and stick them together at the end.” Cook it for too long, though, and the freshness from the paste will be lost.If ingredients are hard to come by, chef Natalie Tangsakul, whose debut venture Talad is a tribute to her northern Thai upbringing, suggests buying a ready-made hung lay curry paste. “It uses spices that are easy to find – cardamom, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cumin.” She adds smoked, dried chillies to taste, then uses it to marinate chicken thighs (or chickpeas, if you’re veggie) overnight alongside garlic and ginger, before frying with tamarind paste, palm sugar and tamari.For Holmes, leftover red curry paste should be seasoned with palm sugar and fish sauce, then rubbed into scored sea bass or bream. After resting for a few hours, deep-fry the fish whole in a wok filled with 180C-degree rapeseed oil for five to six minutes, until crisp, then serve in the middle of the table with salad and rice, “hacking at the fish with your fingers or, these days, a fork and mask”.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

It has certainly turned consumers on to oat milk with sales almost doubling to $200m last year, aided by new products including ice-cream and yogurt.Oaltly chief executive, Toni Petersson, said: “I understand that it may sound naive to actually believe Oatly can change the world – that the impact of what we do can inspire others to make changes that will lead to a global behavioural shift among consumers —but that’s fine.”The cash would be used to fund expansion, including new production plants, and to create jobs in Europe, the US and Asia, he said.Although cow’s milk is still a far bigger market, worth more than £3bn a year in the UK, Britons are buying fewer pints than their parents. What was once touted as a one-stop source of health is slipping out of fashion the average person’s milk consumption in the UK has halved since the 1950s.However, last year UK sales of oat milk more than doubled to £74m, according to the research firm Mintel.Petersson added that getting a major investor such as Blackstone on board was a clear indication that the world is heading in a “new, more sustainable direction”. He said: “Investments from firms like Blackstone in companies like Oatly are a critical step in securing a future of focused green investment … and focuses on urgent, systemic efforts to address the climate crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db14628bf86af8b2871a840c32ad23767bbcb074/0_75_3333_2001/master/3333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0dc3e00943769af1a8716d143245d5d","title":"sam matterface takes up itv football mic after clive tyldesley steps down","story":"Clive Tyldesley says he has been left “upset, annoyed and baffled” after being replaced in his role as ITV’s lead commentator after 22 years.In an emotional video message posted on social media, Tyldesley insisted he did not know why the decision was taken and claimed he had been sacked from the role.Tyldesley has accepted a role as ITV’s No 2 commentator, with Sam Matterface taking over as lead commentator on England matches for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.“I’m being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said. “To be clear, this is ITV’s decision – not mine – and I am upset, annoyed, baffled.“I’ve had broadcasters asking if I have any health issues, no I have got no health issues. I gather one or two sites are reporting that I have been sacked. Well I guess I have … from one job, but I’ve done nothing wrong.“I’m the same person I’ve always been. Like me or hate you’re entitled to do either. Like everyone else in football I’m a matter of opinion, I totally get that. I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me.“But, let me make it quite clear – I have not stepped down, I have been moved aside. I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I’ll miss the Champions League games and that is all.”ITV announced on Tuesday morning that Tyldesley would no longer be the main voice of their football coverage from the start of next season.Joining ITV from the BBC in 1996, Tyldesley became their top commentator after the 1998 World Cup. He covered every international tournament since and noted that he had been due to commentate on the European Championship final last weekend, until it was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The voice behind any number of great international moments, Tyldesley was also synonymous with the Champions League. Thanks to ITV’s long-standing relationship with the competition he provided the words to go with Liverpool’s miracle in Istanbul, Didier Drogba’s header for Chelsea against Bayern Munich and, most famously, “that night in Barcelona” when Manchester United won the Champions League to complete the treble in 1999.The Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling tweeted: “Clive does more prep and stats than me – and his are useful! Baffling as you are as good as ever! Oh I forgot Clive you are 65. Ageism alive and well in UK broadcasting.”Niall Sloane, the director of ITV Sport, meanwhile, paid brief tribute to Tyldesley in a statement: “On behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.“We are very glad he will continue with us and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future.”Matterface, 42, is already a regular commentator for ITV and will take over from Tyledesley in time for England’s proposed autumn internationals. He will not be obliged to give up his role at TalkSport, where he is also chief commentator.The BBC’s Gary Lineker paid tribute to Tyldesley on Twitter, saying: “One of the very best commentators our game has had. Seriously tough act to follow. Good luck, Clive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/543c5e4f17b42f68399a61412b4b2ea309bede18/0_116_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91ea49de1d31eac1202866762e64167f","title":"west bromwich albion v fulham championship live","story":"A goalless draw meant Fulham’s chance of automatic promotion has gone and destiny remains in West Brom’s hands.Talking of the ChampionshipAs we thought, it was a difficult game. A really good side, they made it difficult. They had better of the first half, we had the better of the second. We left some goals out there. We have been really good. We will take heart from that. It’s still in our hands. We are prepared to do whatever it takes. Our goal hasn’t changed. Our target is still as it remains. That’s not the big news in the Championship, however. Take a look at this half-time score. That’s Wigan 7-0 Hull. They scored 6 in the final 18 mins of the half. Follow the latest here.That’s it, and West Brom’s fate is in their own hands while Fulham must now go into the play-offs. If the Baggies win the next two matches they return to the Premier League. Fulham have to take the circuitous route. That was cagey. Neither side wanted to give much away and Fulham didn’t have the quality to break down West Brom.90+5 min: Fulham’s chance fading away. They are pushing on but not with much quality. West Brom choose to play keep-ball and that’s it.90+4 min: A Fulham corner. Joe Bryan can’t beat the first man. It goes back in and Hegazi heads away. Slaven Bilic is stopped from going on the field of play by the fifth official.90+3 min: Final change for West Brom. Krovinovic on for Pereira.90+2 min: Fulham corner. Robson-Kanu climbs highest and West Brom break. Dennis Odoi has to clear his lines all alone as Pereira and Robinson were both looking to get control of the ball. That was a let-off for Fulham. Well done, Odoi.90 min: There will be five minutes added on. 89 min: Fulham push on late. West Brom happy to take a draw? They clear their lines and step up. Cyrus ‘the Virus’ Christie comes on for Fulham for a last stroke of the Scott Parker pen.88 min: Fulham have a free-kick in a dangerous position, but from the right Joe Bryan whips it into86 min: Penalty claim! Robson-Kanu goes down in the box as Tim Ream comes across. It’s not given and rightly so. Slaven Bilic claimed for it, but he’d have been embarrassed if that was actually given. 84 min: Oof, another good ball across goal from Pereira, and it’s begging to be knocked in. But nobody is close enough to get there. 82 min: Phillips set off at pace, and into the Fulham box, only to fall over. It’s been that sort of game.81 min: Another handball claim. Diangana whacked it off the hand of a defender. West Brom have this game in their grip now but can’t find a goal. 79 min: Yet another West Brom corner. Slaven Bilic wants a free-kick for handball. He is getting antsy, and especially after it is wasted. 77 min: Now Pereira has a header wide. The chances are stacking up. Fulham change: Onamah off for Johansen. 76 min: Baggies free-kick on the edge of the area as Mitrovic smashes Livermore over. Pereira shapes to take it. Scott Parker asks the wall to jump. It hits a Fulham foot as he tries to go under.74 min: Maybe not! Knockaert rattles the crossbar as the ball drops on the edge of the box. That was the closest we have come....then Harrison Reed stops goalbound chance for West Brom as Robson-Kanu looked likely to score. 73 min: West Brom corner, though they want a free-kick for Knockaert’s handball. Ajayi got highest from Pereira’s ball and it spins just wide. A goal, should it come, will come from a set piece. 70 min: It’s drinks. Scott Parker is passionate, Slaven Bilic less manic than he was in the first-half drinks break. 69min: The closest we have come! Lovely control by Diangana, and it sends two players the wrong way, and his outside-of-the-boot shot is deflected off the post by Rodak. Then Ajayi heads over as Hector loses him at the corner. 66 min: Charlie Austin is done for the day, and he will be replaced by Hal Robson-Kanu, who will offer something different. Austin did not look too happy with that at all. 65 min: Fulham corner, taken by Bryan, Mitrovic climbs up and Ajayi heads away. 63 min: West Brom corner as Joe Bryan heads behind. Fulham clear that and then Hegazi’s poor cross into the middle is claimed with ease by Rodak.62 min: Scott Parker is now animated. His team are having to do too much defending for his liking. 60 min: Pereira falls in the box but he had slipped and Harrison Reed clears the ball. There is a vain call for a penalty but that was never happening. In fact, it was a fresh air shot. 58 min: Another West Brom free-kick and Pereira has ambitions, 25 yards or so from goal. He goes low and so does Rodak, who saves well57 min: A West Brom free-kick, taken short, and Diangana releases Pereira, whose cross goes across goal. It was begging to be tapped in but Ajayi didn’t read it. That was as close as we have been. 55 min: Jake Livermore, though, is booked for a foul on Reid. It’s an accumulation of offences that leads to the wave of yellow. 54 min: More silliness between Pereira and Hector. The defender smashes into a challenge and then a pat on the head produces a highly theatrical grasp of the head by the Brazilian but the referee calms it down and no cards are waved. 53 min: A very shallow cross is dealt with well by Ajayi, who clears his lines. West Brom holding firm. 52 min: Hegazi again dominant as the ball comes into the West Brom box. Bar a late header in the first half, Mitrovic has not had much of a sniff. 51 min: Alex spells out his mathematics: “As a Fulham fan, I’ve already accepted we are going to be in the playoffs. And Brentford are going like an absolute train. The big reason to win tonight is help Brentford get second and then Fulham face a dejected West Brom in the playoffs.”50 min: Pereira is booked for a clash with Michael Hector. It’s not been a dirty game. It’s not been an anything game. 48 min: West Brom continue to be livelier. Harrison Reed has to come out with the ball past two Baggies to clear. The pressure was on but Fulham soon get back underway. Hegazi has to come across to block a ball meant for Mitrovic.46 min: West Brom have made a change. Matt Phillips, the pride of Scotland, has replaced the disappointing Grosicki. Slaven Bilic’s post-break demeanour is angry, very angry. Meanwhile, Charlie Austin can be heard loudly disputing a decision. “Noooooo!” he says then smiles after it doesn’t go his way. Here’s some aural pleasure while you read about this thriller. It’s very cagey, it’s anti-matter, it’s probably going to be enough for West Brom but not for Fulham. We could say it’s on a knife-edge but that would grant that 45 minutes a drama it did not deserve.45+2 min: Mercy, just two minutes added on. West Brom, though, have to head behind when Reid crosses and Hegazi heads behind with Mitrovic in position. The corner causes real problems and Austin has to jump up to clear. Then Mitrovic heads the next one over. 45 min: Loose play from Fulham gives West Brom some territory with a throw-in. They can’t find anything to trouble the Cottagers defence. Kebano comes away with it, and almost found an opening. Slaven Bilic was raging.43 min: Fulham preparing a change. Cavaleiro has a hamstring problem and Kebano will come on for him. Cavaleiro walks up into the stands at the Hawthorns. Kebano goes out to the left of Fulham’s attack. 42 min: The glimmer of a chance. Austin lurks and Reid heads away from Rodak and then Pereira has a chance to volley in. He misses. So far, he has not lived up to his pre-match billing.40 min: Lovely turn away from Charlie Austin from Joe Bryan. Austin has not been involved other than chasing shadows and neither has Mitrovic. It’s a tight game and the result may turn on which of them gets their chance. 38 min: This is not a classic. It’s, and this is Captain Obvious speaking, really missing the tension of the crowd and its attendant expectations and emotions. 37 min: Pereira at last on the ball though it’s a free-kick that is cleared by Hector. Reid escapes with the ball away from Austin’s challenge and wins a free-kick for Fulham. It was a combine harvester of a tackle.35 min: West Brom the more powerful here but they perhaps lack a bit of finesse around the box. Austin and Pereira haven’t seen enough of the ball either. 33 min: Fulham pinned back. West Brom looking for some passing moves though their latest move fails when O’Shea fails to control a ball played out wide for him to overlap on to.32 min: West Brom have really stepped this up. Townsend is fouled and it’s a free-kick in a dangerous position. Ream has to head that behind. The next one is taken oddly low and cleared.

If you’re a parent like me, you’ll be used to the constant chatter about “when” this hallowed day will be.“Just as we teach our children to wash their hands or cross the road, they need to be taught – and reminded – how to use the digital world safely,” says parenting expert Kathy Weston, founder of Tooled Up Education. “Kids need to understand that a phone is a big responsibility and they need to learn how to handle that.”Try these smartphone guidelines to share with your kids and ensure there is never another cross word about phone use again. Wishful thinking? Maybe. But these six rules might lead to a slightly easier life ...1. Working together on the rulesWe sat down together and worked on a contract. There was give and take – I relented on “only use your phone downstairs” and they accepted parental controls. We regularly tweak the contract to reflect their age.“Aim for transparency and openness,” advises Weston. “If our children understand we have their best interests at heart and share a strong, trusting relationship with us from that first phone purchase, it will be a positive experience.” A good starting point is Vodafone’s digital family pledge, which offers great tech house rules.2. Safety firstWhile online safety is essential, the advice can feel overwhelming. “But internet safety doesn’t have to be complicated and time-consuming,” says cybersecurity expert Jonny Pelter, founder of Simple Cyber Life. “First, check your mobile device settings and ensure screen lock and software updates are turned on, plus secure browsing.”Any mobile will have parental controls to help you manage what your child does online and the main mobile providers automatically block 18+ rated content (the filter doesn’t apply on wifi). My girls also understand I may check in on their phone occasionally and they need to ask before downloading apps.“A phone is not a locked diary it is a gateway to the wider world,” says Weston. “Over time, as trust builds, teens can have more privacy as the extent of parental scrutiny changes.”3. No phones in your bedroom at nightThis is the one golden rule I will never, ever back down on. “One of the main things that affects children’s sleep is gadgets in their rooms at night,” says Weston. The Journal of Youth Studies has found one in five adolescents regularly wake at night to check social media or messages and are three times more likely to feel “constantly tired” at school.In our house, we’ve agreed on no phones after 8.30pm and have a family charging station in the kitchen.4. Remember you can always call your parents, no matter what It’s really important your kids know they can phone you whenever they need. Figuring out data use is part of this and it has definitely been a learning curve for us. Amelia was originally on pay-as-you-go and once when she needed to call me she found she had run out of data! Luckily the “emergency” was buying an ice-cream on a park trip.As giving your child a phone is part of keeping them safe, consider an unlimited data plan so they can always get hold of you, plus have access to apps such as Maps. I found data limits were hard for the kids to understand, so unlimited has made life simpler.5. Get social media savvyLove it or hate it, social media is here to stay. In our house we use “How would Granny react?” as a gauge on how to behave online. Tell them to turn off location and be sure you both understand the privacy and safety settings for different platforms, plus how to block and report.“Ensure privacy settings are tight enough and educate your kids on security hygiene such as not oversharing personal data,” says Pelter. “Obviously ensure they only accept friend requests from people they know in real life.”6. You’re really lucky to have a smartphone Finally, it’s important for kids to understand that having a phone is a total luxury. Research from the Office for National Statistics has found that 700,000 young people in the UK live in “digital poverty”, with no access to a device or the internet at home.Tell your kids about Vodafone and Barnardo’s The Great British Tech Appeal, which collects unused smartphones and tablets for disadvantaged families, children and charity workers. Amazingly, there are approximately 40m unused mobile devices in homes across the UK, so now is the time to put that old phone you haven’t touched for years to better use.Take the stress out of giving your child their first phone by choosing an unlimited data plan, so that you can always keep connected and they always have access to vital apps such Maps.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

I failed to notice that I had inadvertently added four additional packs to my order. So I ended up ordering 40 pairs of briefs at a cost of £193.I tried to cancel the order immediately, but was told to send it away at the door. Unfortunately, I’d broken my ankle so couldn’t get to the door quickly enough. I made an abortive attempt to return the 40 pairs in their entirety, but misunderstood the returns procedure, so the briefs boomeranged back. I’m hoping to return the excess packs when Next reopens but I might just wrap up a pair as a tree present to myself every Xmas for next four years. Tim ClarkThey apologised for the mix-up. Apparently it is a cycling mask for cold weather. We got a refund but she ended up keeping it. Nicholas OettleI love fashion and absolutely hate shopping online. I’ve been buying more fashion magazines than usual to replace browsing in shops, but I cannot bring myself to buy clothes without seeing them and trying them on in real life. But I thought I couldn’t go wrong with some lovely earrings I saw in Grazia – very cool looking amber resin hoops – so I put aside my online shopping fears and ordered them.When they arrived they were at least twice as big as I had imagined. They knock against my jumper if I wear a polo neck, they weigh a ton and hurt when I put my headphones on over them. Both my daughters think they look great so I kept them. Everyone says you can just send it back, but that feels like a personal failure of judgement and taste. Katy LimmerI bought some kitchen cloths from Amazon for £6.99. When the parcel arrived, it was a small box and I thought “that’s a bit big for cloths”. I opened it up to find a kids toy – a talking dinosaur called Torr. It did not clean surfaces at all. I found a gift message in the box too. I think it was meant to go to a little boy for his birthday. Vanessa Hosker, BerkshireI was desperate for flour as my husband is shielding, so I waited to make my order from the Cotswold Flour Mill one morning as they restricted orders to what they could manage each day. Unfortunately for me “should have gone to Specsavers” applied I meant to order a number of inidual bags, but bought a 16kg bag by mistake.At first I offered it for free to people on the local Facebook group formed to help during the crisis, but got no takers. In the end I set up a table in the front garden, bagged it up and made a sign asking people to help themselves on their daily walk. The women were very interested, but the men couldn’t get away quickly enough. My last bag went to two teenage boys I hope their mum was pleased. Sue Frezza, Burton on TrentWhen it arrived I was too nosy and decided to open it. We found it charming … It says all the phrases in Mandarin first, then English, so my child can still understand it. We decided to keep it. It’s funny and different and makes people giggle. Sophie Lawler, SouthportI bought a new wig for my 90-year-old mother. The delivery was very slow and the wig was the wrong colour and the wrong style. I ordered a stylish ash-blonde wig a Donald Trump orange cowpat wig arrived.I tried to return it, but the company suggested I sell it to someone else as returning it would not be cost effective. I am still not sure whether it is a bogus company or maybe even a scam. Their website now pops up all the time on my laptop just to add insult to injury. It was a dreadful experience. Caroline Swan, EdinburghThe water where I live is extremely hard, making my skin and hair feel horrible. Water softeners are quite pricey, so I thought this hard water shower kit could be the answer. When I opened it I realised it was cheap, very plasticky. The hard water filter was heavy and the shower head dropped off the cradle because it couldn’t take the weight. This stretched the hose, which showed the plastic tubing through the centre, which then started to leak. The shower head also had a stream of water drips coming off it. I bought 60 loo rolls on Groupon for £20 including postage. I had not envisaged the reality of 60 loo rolls and was very surprised by the huge bag that arrived on my doorstep. I gave lots of them away and made fun of myself on Facebook. I have previous for this sort of thing, having once ordered a 3kg whole salmon thinking it was three pounds. I had to cook it in the dishwasher. Sue NicholsonI bought a “camping table” from Blacks to prepare and cook meals on, but I neglected to check the dimensions. It doesn’t even reach my knees. The price – just £8 – should have been a clue. I ended up keeping it. My kids will get some use out of it.

She wears her new uniform of pyjama bottoms and a Zoom-ready plain T-shirt. Her room used to be a living room. Now the only communal space is the kitchen, where Francis’s three flatmates occupy a small dining table. They, like almost half of Britain’s workforce, are also working from home.Francis, who is 29, is a credit controller for a charity in central London. She commuted there, by bus and tube, for a little more than a year. There were baking competitions and quizzes and a kitchenette, where gossip and tea flowed freely. Now the kettle is silent and the cubicles are empty. They are likely to remain so for the rest of the year.For the first few weeks after her office closed in late March, Francis was too busy to consider her new circumstances. Then they hit her – and got her down. Days spent in her bedroom hunched over a laptop, centimetres from where she slept, blurred into endless weeks. She has become lonely.Francis has worked for a tool hire firm and a betting chain, as well as for charities. The offices she remembers have taken on a different shape in her mind. “I used to think of a desk as like a kind of prison cell, where I was chained for eight hours a day,” she tells me over the phone. “It was always like serving time. But, at this point, my desk would be my saviour.”Lockdown has not so much redrawn the workplace of millions as it has chewed it up like a broken printer. Working from home, a mode traditionally viewed with suspicion by bosses and with envy by commuting bureausceptics, has become the norm for those whose livings are tied to computer screens.As weeks become months and offices remain closed, many are predicting their permanent decline. Buildings that for decades have defined urban geography, diurnal rhythms and the meaning of work may never hum in the same way to the sounds of keyboards and fluorescent lighting.“I’ve spoken to about eight startups that have already got rid of their office,” says Matt Bradburn, the co-founder of London-based People Collective, which advises companies on human resources. “And we’re talking companies of 50 to 100 people.” Elsewhere, firms including Twitter and Facebook have said they will allow employees to work from home for ever.When Bradburn polled his network of more than 5,000 HR bosses, he asked for the biggest reasons their teams had shared for wanting to go back to the office. Seventy per cent cited social and mental health issues, including feelings of loneliness. “I think young people in particular really need that connection,” Bradburn says.The assumption has been that remote workers slack without direct supervision. But do they? In 2010, a Chinese travel agency with 16,000 employees came to Bloom in search of evidence. Ctrip, which assumed workers would prefer being at home, was spending big money on offices in Shanghai. It wanted to know what remote work might do for the bottom line. “Their proposition was that they’d save on rent, but lose on productivity,” Bloom says.Bloom devised a trial – the first of its kind – involving 250 members of a Ctrip call centre. Half of the group were selected at random to work from home for nine months. The other half would continue to work in the office and the productivity of both teams would be measured.But the experiment also measured happiness. When Ctrip polled staff, half of the home-based group wanted to go back to the office. “Loneliness was the single biggest reason,” Bloom says. Plus, they were not in lockdown conditions: only people with a spare room took part none had children at home or flatmates and they still worked one day a week in the office.Bloom is now constantly fielding calls from anxious executives. “They have said productivity has been great and they’re thinking of abandoning the office,” he says. “I’m counselling that it’s shortsighted and high-risk.” Bloom had always been supportive of remote working, if not full-time, even after the Ctrip experiment. “Now I feel like I’ve gone from being an evangelist for working from home to an evangelist for the office,” he says.Erin Mackenzie, 23, knows what it can be like to work remotely full-time without the stresses of lockdown. Last summer, she got a junior marketing job with an online education company based in the Middle East. Mackenzie, who lives in a small house in a small town 50 miles north of New York City, thought working from home would be great.After four months of long days alone at the tiny desk in her bedroom, Mackenzie had a panic attack. She had lost weight and become depressed. “At first, I thought it was because the job was demanding, but I realised it was more the isolation and not being able to interact with people,” she says. “I hadn’t realised I’d relied on that so heavily for my mental health.”Mackenzie also felt suffocated by the digital monitoring, which was already becoming standard in big firms. Hers was relatively light. An agenda app would track tasks and alert faceless bosses when they were done. Response times to chats were noted. “It definitely added to me feeling like I didn’t have set hours and the anxiety of it all,” she says.If offices were to evolve to extract as much as possible from human resources, there are concerns that firms would use technology to tighten the screws further in our homes. Interest in the software offered by Teramind, a Florida-based employee monitoring and analytics firm with more than 2,000 clients, has tripled in lockdown. When downloaded to employees’ computers, Teramind’s “agent” can measure time spent on different windows. It can play back or live-stream a view of an employee’s screen and record his or her every keystroke. It can also raise a flag if certain predetermined words are typed.Will Gosling, who leads Deloitte’s consulting on “human capital” in the UK, says: “We’re at the beginning of a very big ethical debate about this. We were already seeing businesses wanting to get more data on employees and the pandemic has brought it into sharp focus … but they need to support and build health and wellbeing.”Trade unions worry that working from home will challenge privacy and rights, making it harder for employees to organise or be aware of how colleagues are being treated, particularly in the most onerous fields of white-collar work. There are questions about liability. Mental health is part of the picture. “Employers have a responsibility to ensure worker wellbeing and that doesn’t end just because people are not in the office,” says Tim Sharp, the senior policy officer for employment rights at the Trades Union Congress.Mackenzie quit after the panic attack and got a job with an insurer. She immediately felt better, even while enduring a two-hour commute to Manhattan for her training. She now works in a smaller office a short drive from home – or, rather, she did until the pandemic. It helps that she now works for a better, kinder company. Her fiance is working at home, too. “Without him here, I probably would have crumbled,” she says.At their best, offices are crucibles for ideas and lifelong friendships, particularly among younger workers with small homes but big social circles. The Office was not just a comic study of business park malaise – it was a love story. Working from home may boost productivity for a while, “but it’s so costly in terms of creativity and inspiration”, Bloom says. “We’re all suffering from Zoom overload and feeling worn down.”Flick Adkins, who is 28, counts some of her colleagues as her best friends. For three months, she has been cut off from them while working from the flat she shares with five other people in north London. She works for LRWTonic, a market research company, and takes a lot of private calls. She has to sit cross-legged on her bed, stacking her laptop on part of her vinyl collection. She has settled on 20 records as the optimal height.Adkins’s now empty office has a ping pong table and a coffee machine, where she would chat with friends before starting her day. On Fridays, she and her 20 mostly young colleagues would go out for lunch and have drinks after work.Like Francis, Adkins feels lonely, down and unmotivated. “Having an office was symbolic of normality,” she says. “I loved just being at my desk and hearing the buzz and all the conversations … I can count on two hands the number of times I’ve said: ‘I don’t know much longer I can do this.’”Last month, Adkins’s boss, Anna Dunn, floated with her team the idea of ditching the office for good and saving £200,000 a year in rent. “I said that the money would be distributed to them in a bonus, to some degree,” Dunn, 40, says from her kitchen. She, too, misses the office. “I thought there might be this desire to stay remote, but not one person does. They all want to go back.”The sounds of the office have a new resonance. More than half a million people have tuned into The Sound of Colleagues, a web page and Spotify playlist of workplace sounds, including keyboards, printers, chatter and coffee machines. Red Pipe, a Swedish music and sound studio, created it in April as a joke, but its data suggests that people keep it on in the background.If reports of the death of the office have been exaggerated, everyone agrees it won’t look the same. Bloom envisages a new landscape of smaller offices, with employees alternately working at home for half the week to bring down costs and make physical distancing more viable. Budgets for nice interiors will fall. “I think the office will be more suburban, more spacious and nastier-looking,” he says.Francis would not care. When I speak to her, she has taken a week of holiday. She had anxiety before the pandemic, which partly expressed itself in a need to be busy all the time. But, after three months of sometimes 12-hour days and a deepening sense of unease, burnout has become a worrying prospect. Not that she can really escape her place of work. “I’m just sort of winging it this week and not planning too much,” she says from her bedroom couch. “I just need a bit of time to gather myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c0789298969fd5d5ec4e53f79bac240b173a2f/0_162_5418_3251/master/5418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f250ec9b7cfdb64e0cfab56e16f1cac","title":"what would annexation of parts of the west bank mean for palestinians podcast","story":"The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has proposed permanently seizing Palestinian territory by annexing swathes of the West Bank - a violation of international law.

But there is an acceptance too in government that even if the ‘golden era’ is over, China remains a vital trade relationship as well as a crucial player in global affairs, not least the battle to reduce carbon emissions.

He has since made a good recovery.The case study, published in Nature Communications, follows the birth of a number of babies with Covid-19 who doctors suspect contracted the virus in the womb. Until now, they have not been able to rule out the possibility that the babies were infected during or soon after delivery.“Unfortunately there is no doubt about the transmission in this case,” said Daniele De Luca, medical director of paediatrics and neonatal critical care at the Antoine Béclère hospital in Paris. “Clinicians must be aware that this may happen. It’s not common, that’s for sure, but it may happen and it must be considered in the clinical workout.”The 23-year-old mother was admitted to the hospital on 24 March with a fever and severe cough after contracting coronavirus late in the third trimester. She tested positive for Covid-19 shortly her arrival.Three days after the woman was admitted, monitoring of the baby revealed signs of distress and doctors performed an emergency caesarean with the mother under general anaesthetic. The baby was immediately isolated in a neonatal intensive care unit and intubated because he was affected by the general anaesthetic.Tests on the baby’s blood and fluid extracted from the lungs revealed Covid-19 infection but ruled out other viral, bacterial and fungal infections. More extensive tests revealed that the virus had spread from the mother’s blood into the placenta, where it replicated and caused inflammation, and on to the baby.“The reason this has not been demonstrated before is that you need a lot of samples,” said De Luca. “You need the maternal blood, the newborn blood, the cord blood, the placenta, the amniotic fluid, and it’s extremely difficult to get all these samples in a pandemic with emergencies all around.“There have been some suspected cases, but they remain suspected because nobody had the opportunity to test all of this and check the pathology of the placenta.”The highest levels of virus were found in the placenta, which is rich in the same receptors found in the lungs that the virus uses to invade human cells.While the baby seemed healthy at first, on day three he became irritable and started feeding badly. He developed muscle spasms that made his head, neck and back arch backwards, a neurological symptom seen in some meningitis cases. MRI scans subsequently revealed signs of gliosis, a side effect of neurological injury, which can lead to scarring in the brain.At the time the boy was delivered, there was no clinical guidance on how to treat Covid-19 babies. The doctors considered administering remdesivir, an antiviral drug, but since the baby was recovering gradually without help, no specific medication was given. De Luca said a recent follow-up scan was “almost normal”.“You can see the glass as half empty or half full. The bad news is that in this case history, the virus is attacking the baby, reaching the baby and causing symptoms. The good news is that at the end of the day, the baby very much recovered. The baby is clinically fine,” he said.“Pregnant women should be reassured,” De Luca added. “Pregnancy is very controlled and if you have something like this, it can be controlled. In most cases there will be no damage to the baby. There are many things we can do, but we can’t close our eyes and say this is never going to happen.”Asked if pregnant women should be particularly vigilant about social distancing and washing their hands, to reduce their risk of infection, De Luca said: “This is very much common sense and important whether you are pregnant or not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1788b27d30cec9585b57e2873af5f269c2d4c897/0_467_8111_4866/master/8111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65a1632ed77d7d14f3387464389deee4","title":"the best part was seeing people even from the doorstep how a scandi baker served its harrogate regulars in lockdown","story":"Inspired by his Norwegian grandma’s cooking, Paul Rawlinson opened his own bakery bringing a slice of the Nordics to Yorkshire. But forced to lock down just as he was about to expand, what does he think the future will hold?From serinakaker butter biscuits to cinnamon buns, Paul Rawlinson was raised on Scandinavian treats galore, without even realising that there was anything unusual about it. “We had a waffle iron, and that was very much a tradition on a Sunday afternoon,” he recalls. “I never really wondered why other people didn’t eat them.”Rawlinson, who grew up in Manchester, had his grandmother to thank for the Nordic influence in his upbringing – an influence that continues to have a big bearing on his life and work. Born in Stavanger in 1923, Liv Esther Baltzersen moved to England after meeting her future husband at the London Olympics in 1948, and lived the rest of her life there, mainly in the north-west. Yet she never lost touch with her roots and would celebrate her Norwegian heritage in all sorts of ways – not least through cooking and baking. “These Scandinavian things were just part of visits to grandma really,” says Rawlinson. “There was always Norwegian family visiting, or Norwegian cakes and biscuits on the table.”After five years spent travelling the world as an army officer, Rawlinson decided to settle down in North Yorkshire with his wife – to start a family, and launch a business that he had dreamed about since childhood. In 2012, Baltzersen’s opened in central Harrogate – a cafe where Yorkshire-sourced ingredients meet Scandinavian inspiration. Locals and tourists alike were soon hooked on the homemade smörgåsbord of delights that Rawlinson and his team had to offer. Be it open sandwiches with meatballs or pickled herring, pølse street food sausages, lapskaus meat and potato stew, or traditional heart-shaped Scandi waffles (prepared on irons imported from Trondheim). All that, and enough cinnamon buns to feed a battalion – Baltzersen’s bakes and sells some 10,000 of the icing-swirled delights every year.How did Rawlinson’s time in the army, which saw him serve in Afghanistan among other places, prepare him for his new life serving food in a spa town near the Yorkshire Dales? Better than you might imagine, it turns out. “In many ways, they’re fairly similar,” Rawlinson says, of the military and the hospitality industry. “When you go to Sandhurst, you’re training to be a leader and what I do in my job now is lead people. I was an engineering officer, and I guess engineering is about designing processes and trying to make things as efficient as you can.”This training certainly came into its own when lockdown hit – how could they adapt? Rawlinson and some of his staff launched a major operation to keep the business running online. A small independent business such as Baltzersen’s could well have feared for its future – especially as it had just put the finishing touches to a new off-site bakery, an expansion designed to allow it to bake its own bread among other things. But in adversity Rawlinson sensed opportunity for a new initiative.Within a few days, Baltzersen’s had pivoted to start a “click and collect” option as well delivering their rye breads, sultanaboller buns and “cruffin” pastries direct to customers. The online service quickly proved popular, and Rawlinson ran it with martial discipline, converting the cafe into a temporary “logistics base” to plan and coordinate drop-offs of up to 1,200 products a day to about 100 different homes.“We got loads of nice feedback from people telling us it was the thing they looked forward to each week,” says Rawlinson. “The best part for us was being able to still see the people that we normally would see two, three, four times a week in the cafe, even if it was just from the doorstep, giving us a wave. It was great being able to maintain that connection with our regular guests.”Good reason to hope that the people of Harrogate haven’t forgotten about Baltzersen’s while it has been closed – and that they’ll start to return once lockdown lifts. “That’s a big worry for us, like all independent businesses, after all the work we do to build and maintain relationships with customers,” Rawlinson says. “To be locked down for so long has given people a lot of time to make new habits. Will they come back to us?” he asks.Only time will tell. But he’s encouraged to see Visa’s shop local campaign getting behind the independent traders that are the beating heart of the high street. “A company such as Visa can shine a big light on small businesses like ours,” says Rawlinson. “Hopefully when people read our story, it’ll make them think about their equivalent of Baltzersen’s on their high street, and think ‘it’s important for us to try to get back there reasonably quickly to support the businesses that we love’.”Shop local.

It was an account of my experiences as a club and elite gymnast, and the experiences I shared were the reason for my retirement in January, not a physical injury as was suggested by some at the time.“My complaint was submitted in accordance with the British Gymnastics complaints policy by a legal team from Irwin Mitchell LLP. After eight months, I’m no closer to having any feedback or outcome.”Tinkler, who moved from her previous base at the South Durham Club in Spennymoor to train in Basildon with Max Whitlock’s coach, Scott Hahn, in 2017, said she had spoken out after receiving a lot of support and counselling.“I’m heartbroken by the stories that have been told over the past week. I’m so proud of my fellow gymnasts who have shared their stories, I know how hard it is, and your bravery has been a shining light and inspiration in dark and troubling times for the sport we love.“It took a lot of support and counselling to build up the courage to tell my story. I would like to thank Scott and the team at South Essex Gymnastics Club for everything they did for me, without their help I would never have had the strength to begin this journey. I hope someone now listens to us.”In a statement British Gymnastics confirmed it had received formal notification of the complaint from Tinkler last December. “She provided full details of this complaint to us on 10 March 2020, which then allowed the investigation to proceed,” it added. “It is at an advanced stage and we have kept Amy fully informed and provided her with the appropriate support and we will continue to do so. We can make no further comment at this stage in the process.”Hannah Whelan, who competed for Britain at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, was also critical of British Gymnastics. She said she had contacted the organisation in 2015 and 2018 to raise certain issues but was never contacted back. She accused the governing body of failing in “its duty of care” to athletes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/519939d191e1561f715f4ea6190a3cdec2159db5/0_89_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f40251b5139ef0a6d203f9e7fd6865","title":"henry slade diabetes exeter chiefs england rugby","story":"The England player talks about training through lockdown, Exeter’s title push, playing with diabetes and overcoming OCD“I’m ready to crack on,” Henry Slade says as he looks forward to escaping English rugby’s extended lockdown when the season resumes in mid-August. “I’m pretty fed up with all this corona stuff. We’ve been training in groups of five or 10 but there’s been lots of socially distant running and weights – which is better than nothing. But it’s still pretty crap. If I get started on coronavirus we’ll be talking for ages.”Eight months ago Slade came on in a World Cup final, as England lost against South Africa, and his season since then has been blighted by injury and a global pandemic. His club Exeter Chiefs, however, are five points clear at the top of the Premiership and ready for a serious tilt at the European Champions Cup when rugby restarts behind closed doors.“It’s been very disappointing,” Slade says of the lockdown. “We were really excited about what we could, and still can, achieve this year. When so many competitions were cancelled it seemed pretty ominous. But now I want to get started because we’re in a real good spot domestically and in Europe.”Exeter are at home against Northampton in the European quarter-finals in September but, in less than a month, they resume their Premiership campaign against Leicester. That game will be played at Sandy Park in Exeter but Slade pulls a face at a reminder that Leicester is the only city in England forced back into lockdown. The likelihood is the game will proceed – as long as there is not an outbreak of the virus within the clubs.Slade’s frustration is not expressed lightly. He has overcome diabetes his entire career and so he is acutely aware of health issues. But he shakes his head when asked if his condition has been of concern during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I texted the club doctor as soon as I read that people with diabetes are more at risk. He said: ‘You’re absolutely fine as Type 1 because you’re well controlled and you’re young.’”Slade discovered he had diabetes aged 18 – but he has won 26 caps so far for England as a gifted centre. “My dad helped a lot, because I grew up with him having diabetes. I saw him do everything to control it while playing sport. So that was my automatic response when I got diagnosed just before joining Exeter Chiefs. There was never any thought I wouldn’t keep playing.”Controlling his diabetes has improved as he now wears a device to check his blood sugar levels. “Before this, I was doing the finger-prick test 12 times a day. But this thing I wear now tells me what my blood sugars are every five minutes. I used to finger-prick test my blood five or six times before kick-off. Then a couple of times at half-time and straight after the game. Now it’s updating all the time and tells you which direction your bloods are going. So you can inject accordingly, or have food to keep you in the right spot.”Has he had games when his blood sugar levels have been impacted? “Plenty. I didn’t realise the effects of adrenaline and so after a game I would be feeling awful. So drained and tired, everything hurting. Since changing my monitoring I’ve got way more energy at the end of a game.”At the World Cup in Japan last autumn Slade replaced George Ford, who had often been England’s best player, for the quarter-final against Australia. It was one of many occasions when Eddie Jones surprised everyone, including Slade. “Sometimes in training you can read into the selection a little but I didn’t know and he only announced the team on Thursday. We heard at the same time the media guys released the news. I was happy but everyone bought into the belief we were a squad of 33. Everyone would rather not have played, and won the World Cup, than played every game and lost.”England defeated Australia comprehensively and Slade’s excellence was illustrated when he snaffled the ball on his own 22 and burst into space before, while running hard, using his weaker foot to produce a sublime grubber kick to set up a Jonny May try. Shane Williams, offering analysis on television, said: “That’s absolute genius.”Jones has long admired Slade but that did not prevent him from recalling Ford for the semi-final. “I played well against Australia,” Slade recalls. “I was rusty as it was basically my first game of the season. But at our inidual review Eddie said I did very well and he was very happy. When the team to play New Zealand was announced he explained it was just a change of tactics.”New Zealand are famous for turning on the power and winning games from losing positions but they had no answer against an authoritative England. “You sometimes get feelings in games,” Slade says, “and we just felt we weren’t going to lose. New Zealand had a lot of ball but we have so many players who make dominant tackles. Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Joe Marler put in massive hits.”For the final Jones opted to keep Ford and Owen Farrell at fly-half and inside centre, with Slade on the bench. I worked with Jones on his autobiography for three years and, while writing the last chapter, we met on the Monday night after England lost the final. Jones told me he had been wrong not to start Slade.“When I think about how well the boys played in the New Zealand game can you imagine the shellacking he would have got if he’d made changes and we still lost? I also put myself in those other boys’ shoes. If I’d got dropped after playing that well in the semi-final I’d have been so pissed off. I had no leg to stand on in terms of wanting to start the final.”Slade, at 27, must be optimistic that England can win the 2023 World Cup – and that he can play a significant role? “You have to think that. But three years is a long way away. I’m just worried about next week’s training and how our first game for Exeter goes against Leicester. You can only control what’s in front of you.”During the lockdown Slade had time to reflect. Did he feel angry that Exeter might have been cheated out of other trophies because of the way Saracens broke salary cap rules? “I’m not going to give you a headline like that,” he says dryly. “I don’t actually know the ins and outs of their situation but we’ve played them in a few finals and it’s pretty frustrating to come out on the wrong side.”It’s understandable that Slade should be reticent because many of his England teammates play for Saracens. “We don’t know what other players are getting paid, so you’ve got to look above that to see where the fault lies.”When looking at administrators who run the game what is Slade’s preference in regard to a global calendar? “I like it how it is. I like a summer break and pre-season being in nice weather. I like the start of the season being good, the middle patch being crap and then coming good toward the end again. A team that has to win in the dry and the wet are the real deal.“Obviously there are international windows, Six Nations and then a summer tour. But I don’t fancy club rugby in the summer. Playing the Premiership final at Twickenham often sees it up to 30 degrees and that’s bloody hot. Imagine playing every game like that? I know it’s probably not going to stay the same, but I like it as it is.”Player welfare, surely, must be considered above all else? “I hope so. To play more games than we do is ridiculous. It would be quite dangerous. I hope that is taken into consideration.”During lockdown there has also been time to consider the troubling backdrop to Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. His England teammate Maro Itoje rightly voiced concern but Slade admits he has limited understanding of the controversy. “I had no idea the song had anything to do with slavery. I thought it was a song to cheer on the boys. I’m sure the vast majority of people singing that song had no idea where it originated from.”England’s players will hopefully educate themselves before the next international. Slade has the intelligence and resolve to do so – as he has shown when overcoming other issues. He suffered badly from OCD but finally broke the pattern.“I used to think I had to do things and, if I didn’t, there would be bad news for myself, friends or family. Injury or illness. I’d got it in my head, since I was a little kid, that if I didn’t turn the light switch off the right way, or didn’t put my left sock on before my right sock, or if I put my glass down wrong, it would have a massive effect on the universe.“I had a few sessions with a psychologist and he spoke plainly. Why would me not putting my glass down mean someone’s going to get ill? Why would me not tying my shoelaces right mean someone’s going to get injured? I stopped doing it. Nothing bad happened at training and that weekend I played well. But the worst was playing Wasps away. I didn’t tie my shoelaces how I normally tie them. I went out and broke my leg. That messed me up for a couple of years. But I’ve got used to it and nothing else bad happened. I just tell myself: ‘Look, that’s ridiculous. You’ve been doing it for 20 years but it has no effect on greater things.”Perspective has also been added by the fact that he and his girlfriend are about to become parents. “Megan’s due around 9 August and she’s doing well. But there’s not a lot of space for the baby to go so we’re looking forward to the birth.”Do they know if they are having a boy or girl? “Not yet. There are not many nice surprises in life these days – so this will be a good one.”Henry Slade uses Dexcom’s G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System to help manage his diabetes. dexcomen-GB"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f80c7cdb6bc94e9e203ecc69d6081d1c89268cc/249_900_2033_1220/master/2033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82a65b656ed0a9a9a823adcdbcc66c1","title":"howzat club cricket returns post coronavirus lockdown","story":"After months of waiting amateur players across England were finally able to don the whites this weekend and some of the images were breathtaking "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aacb5e27a2c5cefc848c4683241b162b583f62d/0_31_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=853c3497ea5e78908f1de4203b43c50e","title":"lucian msamati salieri amadeus mozart national theatre at home","story":"The star of the National Theatre’s revival, streaming this month, talks about genius, unlocking characters and how Peter Shaffer’s play became an ‘orgy of artistic love’You played Iago in Othello a year before this production. Was that role – of a man also eaten up by jealousy – preparation for this one?The challenge in all of it is to find the weakest point in any character which, I believe, is how you tap into the humanity of that character without judgment. Tapping into jealousy in itself is very easy. It’s more difficult to tap into love for the victim of that jealousy just as Salieri loves music, Iago loves Othello. I don’t think you can commit yourself to such a dogged path of revenge or retribution unless you feel a great love – from great love comes great hurt and hate. The hate is easier to access than the love and it’s more complicated with Iago.Winsome Pinnock recently suggested that when a black actor is cast in a traditionally “white” part they are cut off from the history of their black body. Do you agree?That’s an interesting idea and I completely see the argument. I, however, would argue that in my creative endeavours and work as an artist the first thing I have connected to is the quality of the work of art. I don’t come into anything unaware of who or what I am and what it represents: my skin-colour and my heritage is mine and I carry it everywhere I go. Whenever someone talks about “colour-blindness” I say “I want you to see my colour.”To go back to the idea of a playground, we, as artists, are players in an imaginative playground and none of us can create unless we have room to breathe and play. Having said that, what we are battling now is the question of what “universal” humanity looks and sounds like. What is problematic with the terminology of blind casting is whether you are saying age, race, gender, is outside the human experience. The singers and orchestra all become part of the performance in Amadeus. How easy was it to navigate around all that movement on stage?It was made easier by the exceptional bunch of players I worked alongside, and both the director, Michael Longhurst, and movement director, Imogen Knight, said that whether we were actors, opera singers or the orchestra, we were all one on stage. It was an orgy of artistic love. To be in a room listening to world-class opera singers and asking them, moist-eyed “How did you do that?” and then to see them moist-eyed as they watched us and being asked the same thing, was to be in a space where we could fully appreciate each other’s artistry, because of the democracy introduced by Michael and Imogen.Salieri speaks of Mozart as an “obscene child” channelling “the voice of God” and the play grapples with the idea that gifted people are not always morally deserving of their gift. What are your reflections on that?I think that that’s the folly of the devout – the great falsehood that “I will get to heaven because I go to church and give alms to the poor and because I’m virtuous.”For me now, I’m a much better actor than I was. I’m older, I’m more evolved and I can now say, empirically, that the roles of Iago and Salieri have come specifically because I’m the best at what I do. The higher I have climbed, the more I have grown into myself as a human being but there are always echoes. Getting Iago – which was the more openly provocative role in terms of tradition – was the moment I wanted to kill the voices that come to me in my 3am chats with myself once and for all. I must also say that part of the space I was granted in terms of playing Iago came from Iqbal Khan. Having a director of colour cannot be underestimated. It meant that the team had my back. I wasn’t the peculiarity in the room."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855421f222a82986bff081d504481f81eb7b2cee/0_3_3900_2342/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22a984e0020ca37593c06e9d2c5c8145","title":"the plot against america tv alternative alternate histories the man in the high castle","story":"The Plot Against America is the latest what-if series about the rise of fascism to arrive on our screens. But while some are sensitively-made, others risk glorifying disturbing beliefsStopping the world and getting off is what TV drama lets us do. Any fiction creates some kind of alternative reality, even if it’s just our own world with imaginary characters. But right now, the alternative history drama, where we exchange our present for a life in which humanity took a different path, is big. HBO’s The Plot Against America, based on Philip Roth’s novel, is just the latest show to comment on our current political reality by placing us at a hypothetical crossroads.Proper alternative histories take a pivotal event and change its outcome, the classic example being the result of the second world war. The allied victory is undone in Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle, and partly reversed in another of its series, Hunters, where the Nazis have lost but retain a network of operatives in the US. Shows such as The Handmaid’s Tale, which introduces a novel event (part of the US is taken over by an extreme religious dictatorship) rather than reshaping an existing one, aren’t alternative histories, but they perform the same function of providing a what-if warning.Alternative histories of whatever hue lean, inevitably at present, towards the theme of fascism. However, such shows can be rife with traps. Take Hunters, a queasy thriller that occasionally affords its story of 70s US neo-Nazis and their equally clandestine pursuers a questionable action-comedy vibe.Not only that, but it regularly features Nazis being so confident, capable and imaginative in their violent hatred that it’s hard not to be perversely impressed. It recalls murder dramas such as Hannibal, where we are encouraged to give killers marks for sadistic flair. Even with fictional culprits, that lingering gaze at brutality can be ethically questionable the way Hunters dreams up elaborate ways in which the Nazis might have killed Jewish people in concentration camps has rightly been criticised for a cavalier melding of the real and the imaginary. When you can imagine actual Nazis enjoying a show, perhaps it’s not “alternative” enough.Besides, it’s easy for alternative-world dramas to wheel out Nazis as cheap signifiers. Season three of Westworld this year widened the show’s universe to include a robot-staffed theme park where the impulses indulged by visitors were those of Italy’s wartime occupiers. Having dangled swastikas in front of the audience, however, the show didn’t say anything profound enough about Nazism to justify the specific referencing. In 2017, the BBC drama SS-GB started strongly with spooky shots of London under Hitler’s rule in a mirror 1940s, but then used the imagined occupation as a backdrop for a sludgy thriller in which fascism was sometimes not much more than a low-key bummer.However, some shows do follow through properly on the Nazi victory premise. The Man in the High Castle, based on Philip K Dick’s novel in which the US of the 60s is split between German and Japanese rule, is alternative history squared, featuring parallel universes. Rather than just being a device to gratuitously intensify the what-if intrigue, it becomes a clever way to give characters, and viewers, vivid lessons, learned with a glimpse at how different their lives could be. The increasingly central protagonist John Smith (Rufus Sewell), an American who becomes a high-ranking Nazi officer, tries to tell himself and others that his own moral responsibility is limited by the sweep of events. He tries not to acknowledge the victims of his actions. But seeing his alternative self making braver choices removes that comfort from him and forces him to face what he’s done.Instead of cartoonish “imagine if that happened” whimsy, the show aims for a fine-grained realism – as you’d expect from its showrunners, the creators of the Wire, David Simon and Ed Burns – majoring on how hard it is for people fighting on the same side of an existential battle to hold the same line, and how everyday life is infected and distorted by the pressure of worrying about what further horrors are on the horizon.This is alternative history at its most powerful, with echoes of Trump’s America pitched at a volume that’s not deafening, but which can’t be ignored. As The Plot Against America zeroes in on iniduals’ response to potentially cataclysmic political shifts, it’s less what if, and more … what now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f058d8dc27e7fcff4f57cb0be8118fc64ca07d/0_341_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8219e5a6e54f9370c6854529acbb95aa","title":"joe biden climate jobs plan","story":"Proposal outlines $2tn for clean energy infrastructure and climate solutions, to be spent as quickly as possible in next four yearsJoe Biden is strengthening and fast-tracking an aggressive climate and jobs plan which advisers say he would take to Congress “immediately”, if elected president.The new proposal outlines $2tn for clean energy infrastructure and other climate solutions, to be spent as quickly as possible in the next four years, what would be the Democrat’s first term in office. Last year, he proposed $1.7tn in spending over 10 years.Two crises are converging: a devastated economy and high unemployment that could drag on for years as the nation struggles to gain control of the coronavirus pandemic, and a rapidly closing window to significantly cut heat-trapping emissions and lead on global climate action.Biden unveiled the climate plan, the second part of his “Build Back Better” proposal, in remarks from Delaware on Tuesday afternoon.“When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is ‘hoax’,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s previous claims that the crisis is fake. “When I think about climate change, the word I think of is ‘jobs’.” In a detailed climate policy speech, Biden said his proposal would create a million jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, a million in upgrading buildings and a quarter million cleaning up after extractive industries. Biden said he would give Americans money back for switching to cleaner cars and making their homes more efficient.He said he’s focusing on his first four years as president because “science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible”. The new goals align Biden more closely with three primary opponents, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Jay Inslee. the Washington governor. They follow the recommendations of a unity taskforce of Sanders and Biden supporters that was co-chaired by the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who co-sponsored the Green New Deal.Biden staffers painted a picture of a modernized America with the “cleanest, safest, fastest rail system in the world”, the biggest electric vehicle manufacturing sector, 4m upgraded buildings and 1.5m new sustainable homes and public housing units. They pitched the spending as a jobs plan as much as a climate program.The blueprint aims for a clean electricity system including renewable power and nuclear energy by 2035. Biden would not ban fracking for natural gas, which would require an act of Congress. But he would prohibit new fracking on public lands.Gina McCarthy, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who is now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the plan was “by a long shot – the most ambitious we have ever seen from any president in our nation’s history”.Labor unions and environmental justice communities would be central to climate efforts, campaign staffers said. Climate change hits low-income and communities of color hardest, a background document noted.Biden would create a national crisis strategy to ensure that government responses to disasters are equitable, start a taskforce to decrease climate risks for the most vulnerable, and establish an office of climate change and health equity.The faster timeline is meant to ensure that no future president can reverse climate gains, in the way Donald Trump’s administration has boosted fossil fuels. Trump plans to exit the Paris climate agreement but Biden has vowed to re-enter it and double down on US contributions.Much of Biden’s plan would require agreement from Congress. Gaining control of the Senate is critical.“He is confident he will be able to work with Congress to get something constructive done,” the senior campaign official said. “He is of course at the same time making sure that he is campaigning in every state needed to make sure that we win every Senate seat we possibly can to further that goal.”Another Biden official said the program would be funded by tax increases for corporations and “asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share”.The updated climate plan follows Biden’s announcement last week of a $700bn “buy American” proposal to revive US manufacturing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59704c0dd72c40beab529dce5b52348a76ab658c/0_178_4061_2435/master/4061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ce844066cb3ee62124767ba9a21f63b","title":"coronavirus spread airborne transmission covid 19 how do we stay safe","story":"Some scientists believe there is growing evidence of airborne transmission of Covid-19Some scientists are warning there is growing evidence of airborne transmission of coronavirus. But how does it affect the actions we should take to stay safe?According to the World Health Organization, airborne transmission involves tiny virus-containing droplets suspended in the air (aerosols) that linger for some time and are carried over distances greater than 1 metre on air currents.These droplets, less than five microns in diameter, contain less virus than large respiratory droplets, but unlike the latter they don’t fall rapidly to the ground.It is not clear. Some laboratory experiments have shown viable coronavirus can linger in aerosols for hours, but these are not “real-life conditions”.And while the WHO has said it is not possible to rule out that cases among people in crowded, poorly ventilated indoor environments such as restaurants, choir practice and fitness classes, were caused by aerosol-related spread, it said the clusters could be explained by transmission via large droplets.David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and chair of the WHO’s strategic and technical advisory group on infectious hazards, said transmission of Covid-19 was known to be possible by exposure to large droplets. However, while the disease could be spread by aerosols, he said there was little sign they travel far – except potentially in the case of aerosol-generating medical procedures.“There is limited evidence that aerosols generated by talking, coughing or sneezing can spread more than 1 metre, thus becoming airborne, and there is limited evidence that airborne transmission plays a role in the community spread of Covid-19,” he said.But not everyone agrees. In an open letter to the WHO last week, 239 scientists raised concerns over aerosol transmission, including over greater distances.“I don’t think you can explain some of the larger super-spreading events such as choir outbreaks other than by aerosols travelling greater than 1 metre,” said Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, and co-author of the letter.Heymann said cloth face coverings were important to protect other people from a wearer infected with Covid-19, particularly when social distancing is difficult – a measure that would also be important if the disease spreads by airborne transmission.To guard against infection of the wearer, N95 respirators are the best type of masks. As for infection through the eyes, experts warn face shields only protect against large droplets – but should be worn by people if up close to others for long periods, such as barbers.The authors of the open latter said hand washing and social distancing were important but also called for improvements in indoor ventilation, as well as the use of airborne infection controls such as air filters and UV lights.Catherine Noakes, a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, who signed the open letter, said there was little evidence of transmission of Covid-19 by aerosols over long distances but aerosols could still pose a risk across a room.Hunter added it could also mean social distancing of more than 2 metres, and widespread use of N95 masks in hospitals. The risk of catching Covid-19 is, generally, lower outdoors than indoors. In enclosed settings, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping windows open or adjusting the air conditioning.Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said good ventilation was going to be even more important as more places reopen, and could mean getting used to open windows even in the winter.“Evidence on air conditioning to date is not strong, but some systems that simply recirculate indoor air are likely to be of limited benefit and may pose risks, ,” said Bauld.A report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has concluded that heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems (HVACs) filter out large droplets containing the coronavirus, although the air flow could blow the droplets over a larger distance than they would travel in a still setting.The report also says such systems could spread Covid-19 aerosols if air is recirculated. But, it adds: “There is currently no evidence of human infection with Sars-CoV-2 caused by infectious aerosols distributed through the ventilation system ducts of HVACs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7a447a9dadf3ccc887b9237613c040a26d44f65/0_159_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a771510bc7084e0d42e8d2fb50a8461e","title":"uk health minister did not see 2017 pandemic report until guardian story","story":"Edward Argar says first time he saw Exercise Cygnus report that exposed governments lack of preparedness was in May A health minister has told MPs that the first time he saw a government report that disclosed the UK’s lack of preparedness for a coronavirus pandemic was when he read about it in the .Edward Argar, appearing before the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, was asked when he first read the findings of a report into Exercise Cygnus, a 2017 simulation of an influenza pandemic that forewarned the crisis in care homes.The report, which concluded starkly that Britain was not adequately prepared for a flu-like pandemic’s “extreme demands”, was disclosed by the  on 7 May.The report contained 26 key recommendations, including boosting the capacity of care homes and the numbers of staff available to work in them. It also warned of the challenge facing homes asked to take in patients from hospitals.William Wragg, the chair of the committee, asked when the findings of the report were circulated to ministers.Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told the committee the report was circulated by her department after she came in to office in February.Wragg asked again: “That report is from a few years ago, so there has been plenty of time. Are you saying that ministers have not seen it? … Which ministers were sent a copy, for example?”Mordaunt said she could not be sure that ministers had seen a copy of the report which may not have been passed on by officials.“Health was the lead department at that time and should be able to tell you that. My understanding, having asked this question is that it was circulated to departments at the time but that does not mean it was necessarily put in front of ministers,” she said.“However, I know ministers who were on a particular sub-committee of the NSC would have seen that. That does not include all ministers. Health will be able to tell you.”Wragg replied: “I have seen a copy of the report. It was exactly the same as the copy of the report on the  website some months before, so I can confirm it exists.

Since 15 June, passengers on public transport in England – including on buses, trains and trams – have been required by law to wear face coverings.Though coverings – such as cloth masks, scarves and bandanas – should go over the mouth and nose, there is no specification on the type, with the government advising people not to use medical-grade masks to ensure they remain available for frontline staff.It remains unclear whether other businesses – such as cafes selling takeaway hot drinks – will be affected.In Scotland, the use of coverings in shops has been mandatory since 10 July, while passengers on public transport have been required to wear one since 22 June.Although shoppers in Northern Ireland and Wales are not required to wear face coverings, both have said they will keep this under review. In Northern Ireland, the use of coverings on public transport has been compulsory since 10 July, while people in Wales will be required to wear three-layer face coverings on public transport including taxis from 27 July.The exemptions for shops in England are expected to be in line with the guidance for public transport. This says that children under 11 are exempt and those with a physical or mental impairment or disability that means they cannot put on or wear a face covering.The rules are to be enforced by the police, and those who fail to wear a face covering in shops will face a fine of up to £100, reduced to £50 if they pay within 14 days.However, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said on Tuesday that retailers “will have a role to play” in ensuring shoppers comply. Meanwhile, Ken Marsh, the chairman of the politan Police Federation, said it would be “nigh on impossible” to enforce the rule because there were not enough officers to police every shop.The British Retail Consortium has welcomed the “clarity” on the use of face coverings in shops in England following days of “mixed messages”.However, Peter Cowgill, the chief executive of JD Sports, criticised the delay in the government’s announcement, and suggested it could diminish customer confidence, while the fact that the rule would not be implemented immediately was “confusing”.He said his stores would offer face coverings to anyone not wearing them but it would not be his staff’s role to enforce the law.“The guidance so far is that our store colleagues are not really to get involved and it’s a police matter to enforce rather than for them to get involved in any potential public disturbances,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee53be0cf47eaf63bdabb20be8d5bb89af340a0/60_106_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f994b1068706e852a9d389b52e3e5842","title":"coronavirus live news update global covid 19 cases pass 13m latest updates","story":"Global cases rise by 1m in five days Hong Kong tightens social distancing 6,000 new cases in RussiaThe US has suffered another 351 and registered 58,858 new cases, Washington’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, taking the respective official totals to 135,235 and 3,355,457.Here are the key global developments in the coronavirus pandemic from the last few hours: Daily new cases in Turkey dropped to fewer than 1,000 for the first time since 11 June, the country’s health minister Fahrettin Koca has said.There were 992 cases identified in the latest count.

I’m not so hopeful about that at all,” he concluded.French president Emmanuel Macron, EU chief Charles Michel and the prime ministers of Italy, Spain and Portugal have all visited the Hague for talks with Rutte in recent days without any sign of a major breakthrough.Basra Children’s Hospital which specialises in cancer treatment has cut admissions by half since May due to coronavirus, its director said, and is battling to keep children safe from infection with a new isolation ward and testing its staff.Hospital director Ali Abulhussein al-Idani said that since June, five children were diagnosed with the illness upon admission to the hospital, including a six month-old child, who died of complications.“The immune system of cancer patients is very weak, it can be close to nil. If a patient (with cancer) catches the coronavirus, he or she will be affected badly and rapidly,” he added.The hospital has boosted ward cleaning and limited visitors to just one per child, is treating more patients as outpatients, as well as routinely testing staff.Iraq has registered 81,757 cases of coronavirus including 3,345 deaths as of Tuesday.The European Union has decided to drop Serbia and Montenegro from its safe list of countries from which non-essential travel is allowed, and did not even discuss including the United States given its sharp rise in coronavirus cases, EU officials told Reuters.EU diplomats today approved a proposal from Germany, now holding the rotating EU presidency, to exclude non-EU Serbia and Montenegro because of spreading infections, officials said. There have been anti-government protests in Serbia, initially sparked by the announcement of a new coronavirus lockdown amid a surge in new cases.The updated list, which will be published in coming hours or days, is only a recommendation and not all of the 27 EU member countries are applying its provisions.After the exclusion of Serbia and Montenegro, 13 countries remain on the EU list: Algeria, Australia, Canada, China, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.Despite China being on the list, travel from there will be allowed only if Chinese authorities also allow in EU visitors. The reciprocity requirement is not applied in the case of the other listed countries.“China has no intention to open its borders to the EU,” an EU diplomat said with respect to discussions with Beijing.Moderna Inc, one of several organisations racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine, said today that it plans to start late stage clinical trials for its candidate on or around 27, according to its listing for the phase 3 study at clinicaltrials.gov. Moderna said it will conduct the trial at 87 study locations, all in the US. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate was the first to enter clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January. Some good news! Saudi Arabian officials have said that the kingdom has seen a decrease in the number of new coronavirus cases over the past seven days.The kingdom recorded 2,692 new infections on Tuesday, the fourth day in a row the numbers have stayed below 3,000. Saudi Arabia has recorded a total of 237,803 cases with 2,283 deaths.The number of new daily infections had reached their highest point of 4,919 on 16 June, but those numbers have been steadily declining since early July, falling below 3,000 for the first time on 10 July.“We’ve noticed a decrease in the number of cases, and in particular the number of critical cases,” Health Ministry spokesman Mohammed Abdelali told a news conference.“We’ve noticed a stabilisation of the numbers of cases we’re monitoring and a decline in the curve.”Spain’s Catalonia region issued a new order to place around 160,000 residents of the Lleida area under confinement to stem a surge in coronavirus infections, defying a judge’s ruling that such a step was unlawful.The new restrictions, which still need to be approved by another judge after the conflicting orders provoked confusion among residents, would come into force in the city of Lleida and seven towns around it on Wednesday and last for 15 days, Catalan government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo said.The regional government was confident the judge would approve the new decree issued as it gives Catalan authorities a stronger legal footing in tackling outbreaks, she said.The new restrictions would only allow people to leave their homes for specific activities like working, buying groceries or exercising. Gatherings of more than 10 people would be banned, she said.Hotels would be closed, as well as restaurants and bars except for food pick-up or delivery.Residents of Lleida, which lies about 180 km (110 miles) west of Barcelona, have been blocked from leaving the area since 4 July amid a surge in coronavirus infections.As cases continued to rise, the regional government on Sunday attempted to confine citizens to their homes but a local judge struck down the order, spreading confusion among residents and further uncertainty among local businesses.Initially one of Europe’s worst hit countries by the pandemic and more than 28,400 people have died, Spain brought the crisis largely under control through a tough national lockdown that was lifted on 21 June.However, more than 170 localised outbreaks have been recorded since then, with 120 still active and with the Lleida region at the centre.Louisiana has emerged as a hotspot for the virus in the United States only months after seeming to contain its outbreak.The Republican vice president, Mike Pence, was scheduled to meet with Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, members of the congressional delegation and state health officials to talk about the states response to the disease.Pence’s visit comes as Louisiana’s confirmed virus cases surged worrying public health experts about the level of virus spread in a state that previously appeared successful in combating its outbreak.In response to the spike in virus cases and hospitalisations, Edwards enacted a statewide mask mandate for anyone aged over eight. He also returned bars to take-out and delivery only. Restaurants, casinos, gyms, salons and other businesses remain open with occupancy restrictions.Iran reports 179 new virus death as authorities announced a decision to once more shutter some businesses in the capital to contain the virus’ resurgence.The reimposition of restrictive measures comes after the government had progressively lifted them from April to reopen its sanctions-hit economy.The one-week measure in Tehran includes the closure of gyms, pools, zoos and cafes.“Holding any social, cultural and religious events and conferences is banned from today for a week,” deputy Tehran governor Hamidreza Goudarzi said.The Islamic republic has been struggling to contain the virus since announcing its first cases in mid-February.It has refrained from enforcing full lockdowns to stop the pandemic’s spread and resorted to closing schools, cancelling public events and banning movement between provinces in March before lifting them.Official figures have shown an upward trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May, when Iran hit a near two-month low in daily recorded infections.Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari raised the country’s overall Covid-19 death toll to 13,211 with the 179 fatalities recorded on Tuesday.She added that 2,521 people had tested positive for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising the total cases confirmed to 262,173.The rising toll has prompted authorities to make masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces and to allow the hardest-hit provinces to reimpose restrictive measures, with Tehran being one of the latest. Masks will become mandatory in all enclosed public spaces in France within the next few weeks, President Emmanuel Macron has said in a major Bastille Day interview.Masks were already obligatory on public transport and recommended in shops, with many store owners refusing to welcome customers not wearing them. Macron said there were “signs that the virus is returning somewhat here and there”, with localised outbreaks causing concern among experts and fears of a further uptick as people leave for their summer holidays. Macron also said France was carrying out about 370,000 Covid-19 tests a week and had the capacity to do twice as many. Testing will soon be available to all without prescription, he said. A pattern emerging here. The northern Indian state of Bihar, which has a population of about 125 million people, will go into a 15-day lockdown to combat coronavirus, its deputy chief minister said on Tuesday.“Bihar government has decided on a 15-day lockdown from 16 July to 31 July. All city municipalities, district headquarters, block headquarters will stay under lockdown. The guidelines are being finalised,” Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted.The announcement came a few hours before the southern city and IT hub Bangalore was due to go into a week-long lockdown. Other states and cities have also imposed restrictions as India’s caseload nears 1 million.On Tuesday, Bihar reported a record 1,432 cases, the third consecutive day with more than 1,000 new infections, taking the impoverished state’s total to almost 19,000 with 134 deaths according to the local health authorities.“There is no medicine or vaccine for corona. We have to ensure that we cover our faces with masks, handkerchiefs or towels,” the deputy chief minister said.After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in late March, India has been steadily easing rules to lessen the huge economic impact, particularly on hundreds of millions of poor Indians who lost their jobs.But infections have continued to soar, passing 900,000 on Monday with almost 24,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures that many experts say underplay the severity of the situation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4304275.1594735970!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"docklands swimming pool worth 15m would cost council zero","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe facility, which would include a cafe or bistro and saunas, is proposed for a site beside Seán O’Casey Bridge, next to the planned €23m whitewater-rafting facility approved by city councillors last December. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A €15 million outdoor heated swimming pool on the river Liffey would be developed at “zero” cost to Dublin City Council, councillors have been told.The facility, which would include a cafe or bistro and saunas, is proposed for a site beside Seán O’Casey Bridge, next to the planned €23 million whitewater-rafting facility approved by city councillors last December.In recent days some councillors and community activists have opposed the pool plan, saying the money would be better spent on housing or community facilities.However, the council’s docklands area manager Derek Kelly on Monday said the project would be entirely privately funded and operated, and would not cost the council any money.“There is no intention of the city council to invest €15 million to do this ourselves,” Mr Kelly said. Outside of some expenditure on consultancy fees to establish if the project was viable, the cost to the council would be “zero” he said.“We need to tease it out to see if there is an appetite out there from the international market to do this.” Similar examples in New York, Helsinki and London had shown there were “plenty of people who design build operate and finance these”, he said.The council is proposing a €10 charge to use the pool, with concessions for those aged over 65 and families. The operator would pay an annual licence fee to the council for 30 years, after which ownership would revert to the council.Mr Kelly pointed out councillors had suggested an outdoor pool or lido be developed when the whitewater rafting project was proposed.SupportiveSeveral councillors representing the southeast of the city were supportive of the plan.“I think it does make sense. I like the project, I like big ideas, I think Dublin needs to have more big ideas,” Labour councillor Dermot Lacey said.Green Party councillor Claire Byrne said while she had concerns about water quality, she was “in theory” supportive of the project. “We can’t just condemn every big ambitious project that we are proposing for the city. We have to think big some times.”Independents4Change councillor Pat Dunne said, if properly run, the project “could enhance the facilities citizens of Dublin have”. However, he said the council needed to address the fact that its swimming pool in Crumlin was only open on a part-time basis.Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan said the proposal for a €15 million pool in the city felt like “two fingers to the people of Crumlin”. He said he had “deep, deep suspicions” as to who was behind the proposal. Independent councillor Mannix Flynn said the council should reflect on its associations with private funders following the collapse of the Parnell Square cultural quarter project. He added the Liffey waters were “unswimmable” last year.Fine Gael councillor Danny Byrne said the council should “stick to the knitting” and address issues such as vermin and weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockAn unpleasant sensation at the back of the throat can be a sign that a cold is on the way. But for one Tokyo woman, the cause of the pain was not a sniffle but a live worm that had lodged itself inside one of her tonsils.Doctors at St Luke’s International hospital in the Japanese capital removed the long black worm with tweezers after the patient had complained of throat pain and irritation, according to a case study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.The worm, which was 38mm long and 1mm wide, was still alive after being retrieved from the woman’s left tonsil, the journal said, adding that her “symptoms rapidly improved” after the procedure.The worm was identified as a nematode roundworm - one of several parasites that can infect people who eat raw fish or meat.The 25-year-old patient confirmed that she had eaten assorted sashimi five days before the worm was removed.According to the journal, doctors said the worm was a fourth-stage larva of the worm, adding that the infection had been caused by its younger incarnation as a third-stage larva that was present in her sashimi dish.The unfortunate diner is not alone. The authors of the study said the number of reported cases had “markedly increased worldwide” due to the growing popularity of sushi and sashimi.Similar infections are sometimes caused by raw or undercooked meat. Two years ago, a 34-year-old Japanese man became infected by roundworm parasites after eating seared chicken sashimi.

Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

Freedom doesn’t come free nor does technological sovereignty come without a hefty price tag.The Government’s reversal of its previous indulgence of the Chinese tech giant as the key supplier of infrastructure for 5G – as it has been for 4G already – comes at a time when political but, more importantly, public opinion is on board for a tougher line with Beijing.Alarming issues from China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to its crackdown in Hong Kong and its aggressive assertiveness towards neighbours like India has woken the British public up to the downsides of China’s extraordinary recent growth in wealth and power.  No-one can accuse Whitehall of showing much foresight about China’s challenge. Boris Johnson’s government inherited two decades of complacent assumptions that China would be just another welcome foreign investor. Some critics argue Britain has been bounced by its major ally into dumping Huawei for fear of incurring secondary US sanctions on its products. There is truth in that. But Washington has also brought to the surface issues of cyber-security and potential data-mining and sabotage which too many in the establishment here preferred to overlook.  Deng Xiaoping once said China should rise unnoticed by its rivals. Maybe the disengagement from Huawei and other Chinese suppliers of key infrastructure should have been done without fanfare. But time for subtlety has passed.Long-term lack of strategic planning has been the hallmark of British governments from Blair via Cameron to today. Think about the looming energy crunch as Britain tries to move to a carbon-neutral future. China’s involvement in nuclear plants was a key part of that. What if Beijing retaliates by pulling the plug on its share of three planned new reactor complexes?Let’s hope the Government has thought through the challenges facing it even having made the right decision. A strategy for handling China over decades cannot be improvised on the model of how Britain has dealt with Covid.  There is a military side to this rivalry. Britain is deploying its newest aircraft carrier, the £3bn HMS Queen Elizabeth, in the Far East to take part in US drills. Big Lizzie is, nonetheless, another product of Whitehall’s short-sightedness, since her delayed entry into service comes a decade after Ark Royal was decommissioned on the eve of intervention in Libya. Even now the carrier lacks all her kit and the escort flotilla needed to protect it from Chinese carrier-killer missiles.Maybe our allies in the Asia-Pacific region will step up to provide the necessary vessels. That would be a good harbinger for a globalised alliance of democracies involving NATO with Australia, Japan and even India. But at the moment it is an improvisation. Sending Queen Elizabeth to the Far East without a plausible escort has ominous echoes of Churchill’s dispatch of the Prince of Wales there in 1941 without air cover.Governments have to react to events, but they need to fit their reaction into a strategic vision and integrate that with their allies’ thinking. Disentangling our infrastructure from China while asserting our commitment to allies in her region is going to challenge our leaders at least as much as tackling Covid. Setting a steady course needs to follow a good start. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cities countries returning lockdown","story":"As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, some people are being forced back under restrictive measures.Nations that previously thought they had the virus under control are now suffering from a rise in cases. Here, we take a look at the locations back under lockdown and how they have chosen different approaches to keeping their populations safe.Key restrictions: A second, six-week lockdown has been introduced in the Australian state of Victoria, home to the city of Melbourne. Citizens will only be allowed to leave home for essential reasons, such as giving care or where working from home is not possible.Restaurants, bars and cafes will have to close but hairdressers may stay open. The border between Victoria and New South Wales has been closed and police say they are setting up  “ring of steel” around the city to prevent movement in and out.Key restrictions: The entire state of California rolled back the easing of its virus restrictions after a spike in cases through the month of June. Although lockdown 2.0 will not be as restrictive as the first iteration, all bars and indoor dining spots have been closed, as well as zoos and museums.In the 30 counties that are on Governor Gavin Newsom’s watchlist, including most of Southern California, gyms, churches, nail salons and other non-essential businesses will also be shuttered. Schools in Los Angeles and San Diego will begin the new academic year online.Key restrictions: Texas Governor Greg Abbott began encouraging people to stay at home in early July following a surge in cases in late June.Masks were made mandatory in counties where over 20 cases were reported and bars were closed, although all other shops and services remain open for now. Restaurants can still serve indoors but capacity has been reduced to 50 per cent. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 100 people, a reduction from 500.Key restrictions: 250,000 residents in the city of Navotas, one of the 16 cities that constitutes politan Manila, will return to lockdown after just six weeks of freedom. Shops and businesses may stay open, but outdoor exercise will be banned and restaurants will be limited to takeaway services.The mayor of Navotas has requested soldiers be deployed to enforce the lockdown and arrest violators. Navotas is the prime fishing port of Manila and is one of the poorest districts in the capital.Key restrictions: Despite being widely acknowledged as a global success when it comes to curbing the advance of the novel coronavirus, Hong Kong is reintroducing some lockdown restrictions after a small spike in cases. Hong Kong Disneyland will close, cinemas will shut their doors and gyms will put up the shutters.Schools have closed a week early for the summer holidays and gatherings will be limited to four people, down from 50.  Restaurants will no longer offer dine-in services for the first time since the outbreak, with takeaways available after 6pm.Key restrictions: The Moroccan government has ordered a localised lockdown of the northern city of Tangier, cutting off all public transport both in and out. Cafes and public spaces have been closed and masks are mandatory. Tangier is suffering with 20 per cent of all cases in Morocco.As such, citizens of the city may now only leave home for essential reasons, such as to buy food or medicine, and will need special authorisation to travel within the city. Tangier is the second Moroccan city to be placed under a repeat lockdown, after the southern city of Safi was restricted from July 5.Key restrictions: India’s IT hub will enter an initial seven-day lockdown after joining the ranks of New Delhi and Mumbai as the epicentres of India’s outbreak. All transport will be banned except in emergency situations and all non-essential shops will have to close their doors.Places of worship and government offices will close but firms operating in the IT sector that provide back-office services for global corporations may keep their offices open, although they can only run at 50 per cent staffing capacity.Key restrictions: A weekend lockdown will come in to force in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. For at least the rest of July, the entire state will lockdown all weekend, from 10pm Friday to 5am Monday.All shops and markets will be forced to close, although banks and construction sites will be allowed to stay open, provided social distancing guidelines are enforced. Key restrictions: The northern state of Bihar will enter into a fresh 15-day lockdown to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mass gatherings will stop and public transport will no longer be running.Restaurants may remain open, but only to provide takeaway services, while schools and places of worship will remain shut. After two weeks, the lockdown will be re-evaluated.Key restrictions: Israel has closed all bars, clubs, gyms  and public swimming pools as cases begin to rise for a second time. Restaurants and places of worship will be permitted to stay open, although their occupancy will be reduced in order to help ensure social distancing.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped the new restrictions would be enough to prevent a full lockdown.Key restrictions: Authorities swiftly reimposed strict lockdown measures in the Chinese capital of Beijing after cases of local transmission were linked to the Xinfadi wholesale food market in June.21 residential communities housing 90,000 people were isolated and over eight million people were tested in just a couple of weeks. Key restrictions: Following an outbreak of Covid-19 cases at the Tonnies meatpacking plant, the town of Guetersloh in Germany was placed under quarantine.Approximately 1,500 workers tested positive, prompting bars, restaurants and schools to close. All employees linked to the plant and their families were ordered to stay home even if they had not tested positive for the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mandatory masks matter politics not public health","story":"It cannot be a coincidence that on the day the Government announces that face coverings in shops will be mandatory from 24 July, a group of scientists led by Sir Patrick Vallance has issued a dire warning about the risk of a ‘second wave’ unless we “get on top of things”. According to this group of 37 scientists from the Academy of Medical Sciences, 119,000 people will die from Covid-19 in hospital this winter. In fact, the death toll could be even higher, they warn, because they haven’t factored in likely deaths in care homes. In the executive summary, the list of steps we need to take to “get on top of things” includes “wearing face coverings in settings where physical distancing is not possible”, i.e. shops. You don’t have to be David Icke to wonder if there are signs of collusion here.But how robust is this report? It is remarkably similar to the infamous March 16 report issued by Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, warning of the imminent “surge” in demand for critical care and predicting the NHS would soon be overwhelmed unless the Government took immediate steps to mitigate the impact of the virus. The following day, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, ordered NHS trusts to “urgently discharge all hospital inpatients who are medically fit to leave”, a diktat that we now know led to some elderly patients who were still infectious with Covid-19 being discharged into care homes. It was because of fear that the NHS would soon by overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, based on the modelling of Professor Ferguson and others, that the absurdly extravagant Nightingale Hospital programme was launched, prompting the Government to commission and build seven new hospitals in England.  In fact, at the height of the crisis, most NHS hospitals were operating at no more than 50 per cent capacity and the Nightingale Hospitals, which cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build, proved unnecessary. Most of the Nightingales remained empty or almost empty at the peak of the crisis and at least one didn’t bother to open. The predicted “surge” in demand for critical care, which the scientists were so confident about four months ago, never materialised. Is it likely to materialise this winter, nevertheless, as this latest group of boffins are predicting? One reason to take their doom-mongering more seriously is that hospitals suspended all surgery that wasn’t “essential” during the crisis – again, due to fears of “the surge” – which means that millions of scheduled operations have been cancelled in the last four months, as well as screening programmes and outpatient care. Consequently, the NHS will be dealing with a huge backlog of patients this winter as a result of unnecessarily turning all those people away this spring. The Academy of Medical Sciences predicts hospital waiting lists could increase from 4.2 million to 10 million by the end of the year.However, the scientists also predict a massive resurgence of Covid-19 infections if we don’t “get on top of things” and that part of the report is unconvincing. For one thing, the paper seems pessimistic about the level of immunity that the UK population has already acquired. They put it at between five and 10 per cent, based on the antibody surveys carried out by the ONS. But there is evidence to suggest that people can become infected and still test negative for IgG antibodies. A recent seroprevalence survey in Spain found that only 16.9 per cent of symptomatic Covid patients went on to develop IgG antibodies, suggesting that the number of people who’ve been infected in the UK could be five or six times higher than the five to 10 per cent with antibodies. How can someone have been infected but still test negative for antibodies? Sometimes because the level will be too low to show up on the standard tests, and sometimes because the patient has what’s known as “T-cell mediated immunity”, whereby they’ve been able to fight off the virus without developing the antibodies for COVID-19. According to a recent scientific study in Cell, ~70 per cent of recovering COVID-19 patients had CD8+ T cells and 100 per cent had CD4+ T cells, both of which help fight the virus, particularly CD8+ T cells. In addition, the researchers detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40-60 per cent of unexposed iniduals, suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. To put it in layman’s terms, if you’ve fought of a cold recently you may have sufficient antibodies in your system to fight off Covid-19.We don’t yet know how much protection T cells provide, but the fact that the number of infections and deaths is falling in all European countries that have eased lockdown restrictions, as well as in those European countries that avoided lockdowns altogether, in spite of most seroprevalence surveys showing that \u0026lt10pc of the populations in those countries have IgG antibodies, suggests something is functioning as a prophylactic against the disease – referred to recently as immunological “dark matter” by Professor Karl Friston. T-cell mediated immunity could be that immunological dark matter. It could partly explain why young people are less susceptible to the virus – the reservoir of programmable T cells declines with age. In a recent article in the Conversation, a Professor of Genetic Epidemiology and a Professor of Epidemiology speculate that T-cell mediated immunity could mean a “population can achieve some sort of immunity to the virus with as little as 20pc infected – a proportion well below the widely accepted herd immunity threshold (60-70pc).”If that’s the case, the UK could have achieved herd immunity already – remember, seroprevalence surveys only measure the percentage of the population that has developed IgG antibodies, not the percentage that’s been exposed to infection. But what if these scientists are wrong and the Academy of Medical Sciences are right in saying between 90-95pc of the population is still vulnerable to the disease? Even then, their prediction of 119,000 likely hospital deaths in the absence of things like mandatory face coverings is an exaggeration. Why? Because they’ve over-estimated the infection fatality rate of the disease, which they claim is 1.1 per cent, and built that assumption into their model.The World Health Organisation initially estimated it at 3.4 per cent Neil Ferguson and his team estimated it at 0.9 per cent the Center for Disease Control’s best estimate was 0.26 per cent, and it will likely continue to fall (although the CDC did raise its estimate on July 10th). As Dr John Lee, a former Professor of Pathology, wrote recently in the Spectator: “It could yet settle closer to 0.1 per cent – similar to seasonal flu – once we get a better understanding of milder, undetected cases and how many deaths it actually caused (rather than deaths where the virus was present).”There’s one final flaw in this doom-mongering report: the scientists’ “reasonable worst case scenario” assumes the reproduction rate of the virus, absent special measures, will be 1.7, meaning that 10 people that are infectious with Covid-19 will go on to infect a further 17. But according to Professor Carl Heneghan and others, the R number had fallen to below one in the week leading up to the full lockdown on March 23 because the more modest social distancing measures that had been introduced already, which did not include mandatory face coverings, were effective. So why have these 37 experts assumed that the same more modest measures would mean the R number climbing to 1.7 this winter?I’m afraid that this report looks suspiciously like a propaganda exercise to try and make compulsory face nappies appear more reasonable. The scientists are right about the stress that’s likely to be placed on the NHS this winter from the backlog of patients who weren’t able to access hospital care this spring. But they would do well to remember that the reason those patients were turned away was because of apocalyptic predictions about the “surge” in demand for critical care that turned out to be wildly inaccurate.

Scans later showed that there was similar inflammation in the brain to that usually seen in adults.The baby was discharged after 18 days, and doctors said his brain had started to recover after two months of follow-up.Commenting on the report, Christoph Lees, professor of obstetrics at Imperial College London, said: This is the most convincing case yet reported of transplacental transmission.We now have data from several thousand of pregnancies where mothers had the virus. In some cases, the babies are likely to have caught the infection either transplacentally, in the process of labourdelivery or afterwards. The great majority of women who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, or indeed have Covid-19, have normal pregnancy outcomes with healthy babies.There have been 244 live born babies of mothers infected with coronavirus in Britain, and 95 per cent showed no sign of the virus. Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health at the University of Oxford, said: The most important message for pregnant women remains to avoid infection through paying attention to hand-washing and social distancing measures.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen not told advance australian prime ministers sacking 1975","story":"The Queen was not directly warned of the Australian Governor-General’s plan to dismiss the Whitlam Government in 1975, newly published letters revealed on Tuesday.The more-than 1,200 pages of correspondence between Sir John Kerr and Her Majesty was kept confidential for almost 45 years, and was only released after a four-year legal battle by political scientist and author, Professor Jenny Hocking.The Palace Letters reveal that the Governor-General did write to the Queen on the subject of his reserve powers, including the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, as early as 12 September 1975 – two months before the dismissal on 11 November.The correspondence also revealed that the Governor General did not warn Gough Whitlam of his plans out of fear the Prime Minister would ask the Queen to remove him, a fear he had also discussed with Prince Charles during his tour of Australia that year.In October, 1975, Mr Charteris and Sir John had discussed the possibility of Mr Whitlam asking the Queen to dismiss Kerr as Governor-General.Mr Charteris wrote: “Prince Charles told me a good deal, and you’d spoken of the possibility of the Prime Minister advising the Queen to terminate your commission... at the end of the road, the Queen - as a constitutional sovereign - would have no option but to follow the advice of her Prime Minister.”After dismissing the government on 11 November, Sir John wrote to the Martin Charteris, the Queen’s private secretary, that same day that he had done so “without informing the palace in advance because, under the Constitution, the responsibility is mine, and I was of the opinion it was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance, though it is of course my duty to tell her immediately.”Six days after the dismissal, Mr Charteris told Sir John - in his first written response - that in not informing the Queen of his plan in advance, the Governor General “acted not only with perfect constitutional propriety but also with admirable consideration for Her Majesty’s position”.In a letter after the dismissal, Sir John wrote that friends had severed ties with him, believing that he had conspired with the Leader of the Opposition, Malcom Fraser, in removing the Prime Minister.He also noted that Mr Whitlam was in “a very great rage” after the dismissal. On the steps of Parliament House after his dismissal, Mr Whitlam said “well may we say God Save The Queen, because nothing will save the Governor General”.The letter also revealed for the first time that Mr Whitlam called Buckingham Palace on the day of the dismissal.Mr Charteris wrote of the call: “Mr Whitlam prefaced his remarks by saying that he was speaking as a ‘private citizen’ ... and said that now supply had been passed he should be re-commissioned as Prime Minister so that he could choose his own time to call an election.”“He spoke calmly and did not ask me to make any approach to the Queen,” Mr Charteris wrote.Once dismissed, Mr Whitlam urged his supporters to “maintain your rage” but Labor lost the subsequent general election that year.Mr Whitlam’s Labor Party was elected as the Federal Government of Australia in 1972 after 23 years in Opposition. The Federal Labor Party had been severely weakened by a split in 1955.Once in office, Mr Whitlam and his ministers embarked on an aggressive campaign of reform.Domestically, Labor , among other things, abolished university fees, created a national Schools Commission to allocate federal funding to schools, established the National Sewerage Program, changed the constitution – by referendum – to give the Federal government authority to legislate on programs and policies pertaining to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, created a universal healthcare system Medibank – now known as Medicare - instituted uniform rail gauge lines across the country, and passed the Racial Discrimination Act.Internationally the government’s policies led one American commentator to write that no country had “reversed its posture in international affairs so totally without going through a domestic revolution”. As Opposition Leader on 1971 Mr Whitlam visited China, and in 1973 he became the first Australian Prime Minister to do so.Labor was re-elected in 1974, but lost control of the Senate when one of the party’s senators died and the government of Queensland defied convention by choosing his replacement, rather than sending the party’s preferred candidate.The government was rocked by scandals and by worsening economic crisis of 1973-75. The Opposition blocked supply in October, sabotaging Labor’s ability to govern effectively, which led to a constitutional crisis and, ultimately, the Governor-General’s intervention and dismissal of the government on 11 November, 1975.Mr Fricker, told local media that the National Archives released 20,000 records a year but received 40,000 requests a year.“I acknowledge the perseverance and dedication of Professor Jenny Hocking. And I want to say again on public record that, while for the past few years, for good reasons, I think, Jenny and I have been in opposite corners throughout this court case, however, never once have we disagreed on the value of the records or the extent to which they might illuminate the understanding of what is a tumultuous period in Australia’s history,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/14/12/sunak.jpg","title":"uk obr economy central scenario forecast coronavirus v shape recovery","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Office for Budget Responsibility\u0027s new projections show\u0026nbspa slower path of recovery and some permanent \u0027scarring\u0027\u0026nbspto the UK’s growth potential as a result of the crisisThe UK Government’s official forecaster is no longer expecting a V-shaped recovery in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown and now sees unemployment soaring to 3.5 million next year.The Office for Budget Responsibility’s more pessimistic “central scenario” published on Tuesday came as the latest official data from the Office for National Statistics showed economic output expanded by a “disappointing” 1.8 per cent in May.In April the OBR had published a scenario showing a record-breaking slump due to the lockdown but a very rapid bounce back in activity in the second half of this year and next year, taking the economy back to its pre-crisis growth path.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIs the UK economy heading for a V-shaped recovery?Yet it’s new central scenario, published as part of its regular Fiscal Sustainability Report, shows a slower path of recovery and some permanent “scarring” to the UK’s growth potential as a result of the crisis.The scenario has the level of UK economy activity still 3.6 per cent below that suggested by the pre-crisis GDP path by 2024.And the outlook for unemployment is worse, with the forecaster now seeing joblessness peaking at 12 per cent later this year as the Government’s furlough scheme is wound down, which would be the worst jobless rate seem in the UK since the mass unemployment of the 1980s.In April the OBR had pencilled in a joblessness peak of 10 per cent this year.A serious concern for ministers and trade unions will be the fact that the OBR’s central scenario shows 15 per cent of the 9.4 million currently furloughed jobs being permanently lost as the scheme ends in the coming months.James Smith of the Resolution Foundation said that this projection should prompt the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to take further action to support jobs in vulnerable sectors of the economy such as hospitality and that his failure to do so in last week’s Summer Statement represented a “significant gamble”.The OBR said that the new spending measures unveiled in the Summer Statement will help take the UK government’s total borrowing in 2020-21 to £370bn, or between 15 and 23 per cent of GDP depending on the shape of the recovery.That higher rate would represent easily the highest UK public borrowing since the Second World War.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment.

To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It puts the UK firmly on the side of the US, which has already imposed sanctions on the company.But aside from the geopolitics of the issue, the decision could mean significant changes for anyone who uses a phone in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHuawei itself has described the decision as bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. But the government has said that it was necessary to protect exactly those citizens, and that it will work to minimise disruption.The ban means that buying new Huawei 5G equipment will be banned at the end of the year, and that all Huawei equipment must be removed from UK 5G networks by the end of 2027. The existing ban on Huawei kit from the most sensitive core parts of the network is still in place.But for daily users, most obvious and probably significant change is that the work to strip Huawei out of the 5G network will delay the rollout of that technology by two to three years, as well as costing billions of pounds.The introduction of 5G has been widely hailed as a potentially transformative technology, since it allows for much faster connections, not only for phones but for any other device that can talk to the internet. That extra speed for the moment remains largely in the future: very few phones are currently able to use 5G networks, and the rollout of devices as well as the network is likely to be slow, meaning that the delay will probably hit fewer people than it would if it affected 4G networks, for example.(Huawei does provide equipment used in those existing 4G networks, but that is not covered by the new ban, despite complaints by some MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith that it should be. As such, those far more popular networks which are used by most modern smartphones should continue working as normal.)Boris Johnson orders Huawei removal from 5G network in major U-turnWith any delay to the infrastructure, users may not be able to get the full value out of their 5G phones, some of which are already out, but many more of which will arrive over the coming months. Some of the more revolutionary applications for 5G – which have included the suggestion that small devices could be given reliable internet connections to make them smart, and the ability to conduct even surgery remotely – might also be held back if the technology is not there.As such, the Huawei ban is less likely to affect any technology you currently have, or rely on. Instead, the main difference it will make is when certain new products arrive or become useful in the future – or whether they will arrive at all.Apart from the delay in its introduction, there is likely to be no obvious change as a result of the move away from Huawei equipment. The products that power the infrastructure underlying mobile data connections are largely invisible to users, and the new network is expected to function in the same way after the change is complete.Other companies are theoretically able to offer the same coverage and functions, and to take over from Huawei. Some have already committed to work in Huawei\u0027s stead, with Arun Bansal, Ericsson\u0027s president of Europe and Latin America, saying that it stands ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable, with no disruption to customers.The US\u0027s actions, which led to the ban in the UK, also affect Huawei equipment that is used in fibre broadband networks, such as those that provide home WiFi. But the government indicated that it would only advise that operators transition away from using new Huawei equipment, rather than requiring old equipment to be quickly changed, as with the 5G network.Taking that approach will help to support the connections that the public relies on, the government said, while still address the security concerns about Huawei equipment.The government said that those compromises were required to ensure that the network was safe, even if it also meant that it would not be available as soon as expected.“5G will be transformative for our country, but only if we have confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure it is built upon, said Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary.Created with Sketch.Europe replicated in Huawei City, China Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China18 Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, Germany28 Replica Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei City, China48 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China68 Replica Cesky Krumlov in Huawei City, China88 Replica Heidelberg in Huawei City, China“Following US sanctions against Huawei and updated technical advice from our cyber experts, the government has decided it is necessary to ban Huawei from our 5G networks. “No new kit is to be added from January 2021, and UK 5G networks will be Huawei free by the end of 2027. This decisive move provides the industry with the clarity and certainty it needs to get on with delivering 5G across the UK.The announcement only covers Huawei equipment used in the phone network\u0027s infrastructure, and not Huawei\u0027s phones themselves. They remain on sale in the UK – though because of a ban on Google providing products to the company, they are unable to use Android on new devices, and so the phones may not be as fully featured as they would be without the ongoing fallout.Huawei attacked the decision, but committed to continue to support our customers.This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone. It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK, said Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK.Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicised, this is about US trade policy and not security. Over the past 20 years, Huawei has focused on building a better connected UK. As a responsible business, we will continue to support our customers as we have always done.We will conduct a detailed review of what today’s announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I trust people’s good sense.”The cabinet office minister also revealed the government was significantly boosting the manufacture of face coverings, with factories “in Wales and Burnley”.Vaccine doses for all ‘in first half of next year’ if trials succeedThe government has been accused of spreading confusion on the issue, with only 36 per cent of Britons wearing coverings in public places – far short of the numbers in France (78 per cent) and Italy (83 per cent).Some scientists had welcomed the prime minister’s hints at being ‘stricter”, when he said: “We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.”Professor Venki Ramakrishnan, president of The Royal Society, said everyone’s mouth and nose should be covered in public, to reduce the risk of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organisation said last week that there is “emerging evidence” that infections could be spread through particles travelling through the air.Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Gove said “If tough measures are required, as we have seen in Leicester ... then tough measures will be taken.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We already have it on public transport,” she said.Mr Gove also confirmed the government wanted people to return to work, rather than stay at home, to ensure the “economic engines of this country are fired up again”.“We want to see more people back at work, on the shop floor, in the office, wherever they can be,” he told Sky News.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Michael Gove is under fire for failing to wear a face covering while shopping – two days after telling the public it is “good sense” to do so.On Sunday, the cabinet office minister told TV viewers: “It is basic good manners, courtesy and consideration to wear a face mask if, for example, you are in a shop.”Yet, on Tuesday, he was photographed in a branch of Pret a Manger without a mask, even as his cabinet colleague Liz Truss’s face was covered up as she bought her breakfast.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA professor of public health said Mr Gove’s behaviour was “very destructive” to what was already “very confused” government messaging.“When people see politicians adding to the confusion, they throw their hands up in the air and say ‘Why should I bother?’ Gabriel Scally told The Independent.And Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: “Michael Gove\u0027s refusal to wear a mask today will simply lead to more accusations that it is one rule for the government, and one for everyone else.”The controversy came after Mr Gove was left embarrassed when Boris Johnson overruled him and announced mask-wearing in shops in England will be compulsory – from 24 July.Ministers were already facing criticism for delaying the crackdown by 10 days, after days of confusion over the policy.Face coverings in public places where people cannot safely socially distance was already the norm in more than 120 countries, including many in Europe, he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Michael Gove, it seems, is capable of neither.”People who fail to comply with the new requirement will risk a fine of up to £100, although the Police Federation warned that would be “nigh-on impossible” to enforce.George Eustice, the environment secretary, defended the 24 July timetable as necessary “for retailers to put in place measures to encourage people to do this, or potentially even to have some masks themselves if people haven\u0027t got one”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Boris says: “The balance of scientic opinion has shted in favour of them.”But as they could tell you in Japan or South Korea, a mask protects other people from whatever bug you are carrying.They also send a powerful psychological message: “I take this horrible disease seriously and so should you.”And I can exclusively reveal that wearing a face mask has not shrunk my manhood.But still men — women are more pragmatic — recoil from face condoms. Research at Middlesex University concluded that men are less likely to wear masks than women because blokes think it “is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness and a stigma”.Signicantly, it is those nations with no face mask culture where the coronavirus death toll is truly horric.We don’t need the ever-changing science to tell us masks work. Common sense tells us masks work. As do death tolls.In the US, , dead. In the UK, , dead.And in Brazil, where hard-man president Jair Bolsonaro disparaged face masks right up until the moment he caught Covid- — now you can’t get El Presidente out of one — they have , dead.But in nations where wearing face masks is widespread, the number of deaths is tiny.In Japan and South Koreathere are fewer than , and  dead respectively.But in England and Wales, despite the PM’s hints, you STILL don’t have to wear a face mask in shops. It is heartbreaking that the West has not caught on quick enough.In Asia, masks are not worn to protect the wearer. They are worn to protect everybody .My Japanese we believes Western countries have not got the face mask habit because, to us, nothing is more important than the inidual.Yet in Japan and South Korea — and, indeed, China — the inidual is less important than the wider society.You don’t wear a face mask for yourself.

They need our help.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWe can all play a part in saving our towns and cities.If we head out to eat, drink and shop, we can throw a leline to businesses on the edge.It’s our patriotic duty to get back to the pub.For years, town centres have struggled because it is hard for shops to compete with the online retail giants.The switch from old-style shopping to ordering online has sped up in lockdown.The Government’s massive programme of economic support has helped many businesses survive.A total of £.billion in grants has been paid to more than , firms, mainly in hospitality and retail.The Government is also paying the wages of .million people through the furlough scheme.I have heard from small businesses in my Chipping Barnet constituency in Greater London how vital this help has been in getting them through lockdown.But the only long-term way to save these businesses is for customers to start heading through their doors again.That is why I was one of the first MPs to call for the lockdown to be lted.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given us the freedom to go back to work and back into town, we need to use it.With so many still working from home, our city centres feel like ghost towns.Jobs are already going or under threat at many familiar big names, from Boots and Burger King to Pret and John Lewis.Taxi drivers, caterers, news vendors, cleaners, millions of livelihoods depend on bustl-ing offices and workplaces filled with people.The situation is very grave. Economists are predicting one of the worst global recessions since records began, with up to .million Brits potentially losing jobs.All the evidence indicates that prosperity is driven by successful cities.If tumbleweed continues to roll through London’s world-class tourist attractions,Manchester’s bars and clubs are half empty,Newcastle’s nightle remains muted, then pulling ourselves out of recession will be far harder.For the sake of all our great cities, we need office workers back at their desks.Of course, it is vital that we behave responsibly and respect social-distancing rules.Huge care has been taken to ensure the process of lting the lockdown is a cautious and gradual one, with some £million being spent to make the high street safe and ready to welcome people back.And I pay tribute to the massive efforts being made by businesses doing everything possible to make their premises Covid-secure to keep their workers and customers safe.I know their reluctance toto public transport. I see that every day as I commute to Westminster on near-empty Tube carriages.But the simple precautions of wearing a face covering and washing your hands thoroughly when you reach your destination can help keep you and others safe.Nothing in le comes without some risk, but the steady fall in Covid cases means that, for the vast majority of us, the risk of catching the virus is getting lower every day.So people should feel confident to go out to their workplace again, and they should also feel happy and secure about grabbing a bite to eat with friends in a cafe.This could be make or break for your city centre.Unless you come to the rescue by spending some money to support these local businesses, they could go under for ever.Saving our city and town centres isn’t just about jobs and the economy.They are the heart of community le.As an example, for many elderly people, popping out to the shops is a hugely important social contact, especiallythey do not have family living nearby.If our town centres become a row of empty shops and boarded-up pubs, that is a heartbreaking loss for our whole community.It would leave all of us more isolated from our neighbours.When the pandemic hit, this country came together in an incredible united effort to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Now we need to show that same determination when it comes to reviving the economy, saving jobs and supporting businesses in our villages, towns and cities.That means starting up the commute again and getting back to the office.It’s not every day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will knock £ off our lunch bills.But that is what will happen during August.Soyou value your local High Street and want to see it thrive in the future, then head there and eat out to help out.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover.

The High Court today was told how Heard appeared on the Late Late Show with James Corden on December , , the night after the alleged incident.Heard is then said to have exclaimed Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes  after the show. But Hollywood stylist Samantha McMillen today took the stand in the libel case, claiming she had not seen the actress with any visible marks on her face or body.In a witness statement to the court, she said: I saw her throughout the day, in good light, at close range, wearing no makeup.Throughout the day, I could see clearly that Amber did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.After the show, Ms Heard said to me, ‘Can you believe I just did that show with two black eyes ’ But she did not have any black eyes, and had been visibly uninjured throughout the day and at that moment.I later learned that Ms Heard had accused Johnny Depp of violently abusing her the previous night.The High Court heard today:She said she had been confused by Heards comments about the bruises, saying: I didnt see the black eyes, but also I dont want to, you know, raise any sort of - I just wanted to go home.Ms McMillen said he later overheard Ms Heard telling a pal: “Make sure to get those pictures on to my computer” - but she didn’t know what pictures she was referring to.Sasha Wass QC, representing News Group Newspapers, then referred to a message sent by Heard in December , which read: Johnny did a number on me tonight. The barrister asked: Did Ms Heard ever say to you that Johnny did a number on her  Ms McMillen said: She never said anything about that to me.And the stylist admitted she was loyal to Depp, saying: I’m loyal because he is kind and loyal back, but not for any other reason than that.Ms McMillen was then asked about an email sent by Ms Heard to her publicist, Jodi Gottlieb, in the early hours of December  which said: Im really bruised or might have a black eye or two tomorrow … I might not be fit for tomorrow but I wont know how bad the bruise is until the morning.And she said she couldnt think of why she would have sent the emailshe didnt have the injuries.The stylist also said she didnt remember any conversation with Heards make-up artist, Melanie Inglessis, that she was going to put a really bright red lipstick on Ms Heard to try and cover the mark on her lip.Depp has claimed Ms Heard faked the injuries as part of an “insurance dossier” against him.Heard has claimed Depp attacked her in a prolonged and violent assault the night before.The assault allegedly happened on the night of December ,  at the penthouse shared by the couple.Depp allegedly threw a decanter at Heard, slapped her face and dragged her through the apartment by the hair.He was said to have pulled “large chunks of hair and scalp” out of Ms Heard’s head as he pulled her up the stairs while threatening to kill her.As Heard tried to escape the violence, Depp allegedly hit her in the back of the head and knocked her to the floor. As she staggered to her feet, it was claimed, Depp screamed: “Oh, you think you’re a f***ing tough guy ” before headbutting her in her face.He then allegedly threw her on to the bed and knelt on her back while repeatedly punching her in her head, screaming: “I f***ing hate you” over and over again.Heard suffered severe headaches and other pains for at least a week after the attack, it was claimed.Later, Depp allegedly wrote a message on the kitchen countertop in gold pen that read: “Why be a fraud  All is such bulls***.”Depp told the court: “I was not violent toward Ms Heard in any way. In fact, on this date, Ms Heard violently attacked me, as she had done many times before, leaving me with a number of scratches and swelling around my face.Ms Heard has fabricated these allegations, including ly claiming that the blond hair on the floor was her hair that had been pulled out by me.I remember this period as one in which Ms Heard was continually trying to argue with me and at times would physically assault me.If Ms Heard had actually been assaulted in the way she described, she would have had very severe and visible injuries. There is no evidence whatsoever of this having been the case.The actor’s case against NGN and executive editor Dan Wootton came after an article was published in  with the headline “Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting we beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film ”.NGN is defending the article as true and says Mr Depp was “controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and or drugs” between early  and May , when the couple split.The pair met in  and began living together in  before marrying in Los Angeles in February .If you are affected by domestic abuse, please call the National Domestic Abuse Helpline on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have never and will never compromise that security in pursuit of economic prosperity.MPs warned the action could lead to retaliation from China.Sources said security services were ready for any cyber attacks in response to todays decision, but stressed the UK was always ready for state sponsored cyber attacks of any kind.Mr Dowden added: This government will not be cowed by the comments of any other country and indeed this decision has been made in the national security interests of this nation.The Culture Secretary also revealed the new Telecoms Security bill would be coming in the Autumn, but refused to say exactly when.It comes after a growing revolt from Mr Johnsons own MPs over the Chinese company’s technology.Speaking in the chamber, Tory MP Anthony Mangnall called for the  date to be brought forward, and accused Huawei of using slave labour.He said: If the Government is going to be clear-eyed about China, it must also be clear-eyed about the human rights violations that are reportedly being undertaken by Huawei and their use of slave labour.It is not acceptable for a global Britain to be involved in a company that is perpetually using slave labour in their supply chain.”Iain Duncan Smith became the most senior Tory to complain that the seven-year removal is too long.He said: Lets bring it forward to five, and make sure it happens quickly.In a letter to Mr Johnson, ten Tory MPs had bashed the “unreasonable delay”. They said: “We do not believe it is possible for the UK to have both secure networks and a role for Huawei within them. “It remains the case that, under China’s national intelligence law, Huawei is obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence and to deny that it does so. The nature of Chinese law is such that Huawei is — to all intents and purposes — a state-owned enterprise.In the last month alone, the world has been confronted with shocking new evidence of systematic human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party. These include a birth suppression programme directed against Uighur Muslims by the authorities.“Knowing how lightly China takes the assurances it has given, many colleagues are even more uncomfortable about a role for Huawei in our networks.The MPs include former party leader IDS, ex-cabinet minister David Davis and Bob Seely.Mr Seely had also warned that the government would face further furythe deadline was pushed back until the end of the decade.A Whitehall official explained today that it was not as simple as just taking off a piece of equipment.They said: It is not just ripping out an aerial, you are dismantling a highly intelligent piece of equipment.The Government announced in January that Huwaei would be limited to the core of the G network and just  per cent market share of the other parts.This morning Lord Browne of Madingley stepped down early as the UK chairman of Huawei Technologies ahead of the ban.Yesterday BT chief Philip Jansen warned of possible “outages”they are ordered to remove all Huawei products which help run G and G networks over security risks.He said: “I think that’s impossible to do in under ten years.Huawei has always denied that it poses any security risk and insists that it is a private company free from Chinese state control.Ed Brewster, a spokesperson for Huawei UK, said: This disappointing decision is bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone.“It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital ide. Instead of ‘levelling up’ the government is levelling down and we urge them to reconsider. We remain confident that the new US restrictions would not have affected the resilience or security of the products we supply to the UK.“Regrettably our future in the UK has become politicized, this is about US trade policy and not security.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So, the timing is very, very important. If we can stop it early, we can save lives.The former specialist in virology said she feared she would be killed for speaking out in China and chose to escape to the United States, where she is currently hiding at an undisclosed location.Yan is now determined to expose the Chinese government for allegedly knowing about the novel coronavirus before publicly acknowledging the outbreak.She told Fox News: “The reason I came to the U.S. is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed.According to Yan, the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff suppressed evidence that coronavirus could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. Yan, who grew up in mainland China, said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases in Wuhan.She claims her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year.Yan said: “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China.”So I turned to my friends to get more information.She said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the friend told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed.She was also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially.She claims that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was told to keep silent and be careful.He warned me..., Dont touch the red line, Dr Li said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.We will get in trouble and well be disappeared. The scientist says it was information that she believes could have saved lives.Yan claimed the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in China.Yan explained: “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus.”Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue.Ill-fated whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter by the police before he died.Wenliang was told by copshe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by the deadly virus.Yan told Hemmer that she has records of communications with others in China, and underlined that she is very much in fear for her le.She said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.”[They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.”I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.”She went on: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the U.S. people to understand how terrible this is. It is not what you have seen. This is something very dferent.“We have to chase the true evidence and get the real evidence because this is a key part to stop this pandemic. We dont have much time.A bombshell spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.A -page document, obtained by Australias The Saturday , laid the foundation for a case being created against China for its handling of the deadly disease.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The World Health Organisation does the same.

He told the House of Commons: There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop.Face coverings can make shoppers feel even more confident about ing to the high street.They have a part to play in helping the nation recover and protecting shop workers, he added.Mr Hancock said that those shops can call the policepeople without an exemption from wearing a face covering refuse to comply.Kids under  and those with disabilities will be exempt.And he accused Labour of making the issue a party political football.Deaths among shop assistants % higher for men and % higher for women than general population and the policy will help protect those more at risk because of their jobs, Mr Hancock said. When askedthe mandatory mask rule would be extended to offices, George Eustice told BBC Radio : At the moment we take one step at a time and weve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.When it comes to workplace environments, because people are in the same company throughout the day, there are not lots of people coming through the venue as you have in a retail environment. The risk of transmission is therefore lower. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has been calling for mandatory face masks for months, slammed the PM for failing to make people feel safer.He told Good Morning Britain: I wish it had been brought in today rather than next Friday. This will help all of us be safer and could prevent a second wave that could have led to a second lockdown, which none of us wants. What has been announced:But Mr Eustice said the delay in the change was to give businesses time to prepare - despite guidance over masks being issued months ago. He said: Two things have been going on - evidence and understanding has been evolving, WHO changed its guidance back in June. We then loosened the lockdown and allowed more venues to open.We need to consider the mix of measures we have in place and control the virus. Some Conservative Party members have cut up their membership in protest of the move to make masks mandatory - claiming it goes against the partys libertarian values. The hashtag #NoMasks and the word muzzles were both trending on Twitter this morning. Studies have shown wearing masks has a signicant effect on stopping people who are infected from infecting others and spreading the virus - sometimes without symptoms.And other European countries such as Italy made face masks compulsory in all indoor spaces as they allowed shops and restaurants to reopen. Mr Eustice said people wont have to wear face masks to restaurants or bars - but would have to wear them at hairdressers. The mixed messages over where to wear masks adds to the confusion which started last Friday, when Boris Johnson said he was looking at tightening up the rules to make sure that more people wear them. But only days later, Michael Gove told BBCs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: I dont think mandatory, no, but I would encourage people to wear face masks where they are inside and mixing with others, and the ventilation isnt as good.  At the moment its only mandatory to wear a mask on public transport - like trains, planes, buses or trams.Only a handful of fines have been dished out to people for not wearing them.Police are also outraged - claiming they wont be able to shoulder the responsibility to ensure people where masks, branding the policy absurd. politan Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh told Radio : Shopkeepers need to step up to the plate and take some responsibility. They can quite easily put signs up on their doors No mask on, no entry, this is private property.The second point is it will be nigh-on impossible for enforcement because you wont have a police officer on every shop door because there isnt enough of us.If a shopkeeper calls the police because someone hasnt got a mask on, they havent got the power to detain them so that person can just walk away.Well be driving around and around London looking for people who arent wearing masks, its absolutely absurd.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today the figure is .Authorities previously raised concern workers made regular trips to a Morrisons store in nearby Malvern.Herefordshire Council is arranging food and essential supplies for residents on the site.A spokesperson for Iceland said: Our store colleagues in Worcester have no recollection of this group visiting the store. We are confident that the store is following all company guidelines for social distancing, hygiene and operating processes to ensure a safe environment for colleagues and customers alike.A Primark spokesperson said: Nothing is more important to us than the safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees, and we have extensive safety measures in place across all our stores, including a strict social distancing protocol, personal protection for employees and customers and increased in-store cleaning.

Wikoff said: The purpose is to show an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability.Wikoff, commander of the strike group led by the Ronald Reagan, insisted the exercises were not a response to those being conducted by China.The Pentagon has criticised the Beijing’s drills as counter-productive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability.The United States accuses China of trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to use the seas extensive oil and gas reserves.Beijing claims it owns most of the disputed patch of ocean but other nations claim their own chunks under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The convention states that nations’ claims to the waters around them must be measured from land.To thwart this, Beijing has been building man-made islands on top of coral reefs in the middle of the sea and packing them with weapons as they attempt to region into a fortress.Mr Pompeo has previously accused China of using the Covid- pandemic to assert control of the region and flex its military muscles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The hardest part - and it was the hardest part for me - is to chase your convictions with actions.She said young people were setting the tone for an equitable humanity.This is a humanity that desperately needs you...

Meghan would not have been able to make these highly-charged comments on world leaders while still in the Royal Family.Her intervention comes days after she sparked anger along with Prince Harry by saying we must acknowledge the uncomfortable past of the Commonwealth.During todays speech, she told women to drown out negative voices and not listen to those trying to bring them down.There will always be negative voices and sometimes those voices can appear to be outsized, and sometimes they can appear to be painfully loud, she said.You can and will use your own voices to drown out the noise. Because thats what it is - just noise.Meghans criticism of negative voices could be seen as a dig at those she felt unfairly targeted her during her time living in Britain.But your voices are those of truth.

The newspaper denies the allegations.In her speech, Meghan praised activism carried out by women.Girl Up members are organising Black Lives Matter protests around the world, you are creating films to encourage your peers to become activist leaders... you are standing up and demanding to be heard, [and] youre also demanding to own the conversation, she said.Meghan quoted the Dalai Lama and said women should show compassion to others.The Dalai Lama famously said: Compassion is the radicalism of our time, she said.Compassion means seeing the pain and suffering of others and knowing its our duty to try to help relieve it.Meghan, Prince Harry and Archie are currently staying in Hollywood producer Tyler Perrys  million mansion, where she has been spending lockdown with husband Prince Harry.Meghan and Harry have signed with the same New York-based speaking agency that represents the Obamas.The speech was Meghans first major public appearance since a tumultuous Megxit, and was broadcast to more than , people watching online.She wore a blue dress and a £, Cartier ct gold bracelet.Facebooks chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was also a special guest as part of the summit which runs from July  to .Girl Up was started by the UN Foundation and is dedicated to securing equal opportunities for underprivileged adolescent girls in developing countries.Her comments come after she was spotted hopping into a gas-guzzling SUV in Los Angeles with Prince Harry last week. The couple were seen wearing coronavirus face masks as they stepped out in Beverly Hills on Friday.But the pair – who often lecture others on the need to fight climate change – were spotted hopping into their enormous £, Cadillac Escalade.The beast of a car, with its six-litre engine, has been dubbed in online reviews as being “as far from environmentally-friendly as you can get”, Mail Online reports.Their one-year-old son, Archie, was not pictured with them.The former Royals have previously been accused of hypocrisy over their repeated use of private jets while urging the public to watch their carbon footprint.He gave a speech last year saying: “We could all do better.“While no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own inidual impact.”Harry responded to criticism by insisting he flies commercial “ per cent of the time” and that he “offsets his CO” whenever he is forced to fly privately to protect his family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

People entering shops and supermarkets in England must wear a face covering from July , with police fines of up to £ for those who flout the rules. However, the new regulations only apply to customers and suppliers entering retail outlets, government sources said. Staff will be covered by existing regulations, which place the burden on employers to make sure their workplaces are safe from the deadly virus. Firms are required to do risk assessments to decide on how to keep staff and customers safe. Measures including personal protective equipment, perspex screens and additional handwashing facilities. That suggests some staff will wear masks, coverings or visors, but it will not be a blanket policy. This is similar to the existing law making face masks compulsory on Englandaposs public transport - which exempts staff carrying out their work. Other exemptions include for children under , people with certain disabilities, or companions of deaf people who need to lip-read. Health Secretary Matt Hancock today said the policy would help restore shoppersapos confidence to get back on the high street.  But he faced questions about how the policy would work. He said shop staff will be able to refuse entry to those who donapost comply - and then call police, who have the power to issue £ fines as a last resort.

And he said the purchase of Huawei G kit would be banned by the end of the year. The move was announced in parliament by culture minister Oliver Dowden, who said the imposition of new sanctions by the United States signicantly changed the assessment of Britainaposs National Cyber Security Centre, who could not guarantee the security of future Huawei G equipment. But what does all this mean  Will Huawei phones stop working  And are they safe to use  Hereaposs everything you need to know. What has changed  In May, the US issued a sanction blocking US software and technology firms from working with Huawei. It also blocks Huawei chips from being manufactured using US technology - or even within a factory that uses US technology. That means the firm needs to make major changes to how it designs and builds its hardware - which includes network equipment.What does that mean for the UK  In January, the National Cyber Security Centre decided it was OK for Huawei to have a limited role in the rollout of new G networks. But theyaposve changed their mind because of the new sanction - and because they can no longer work with US technology, they no longer consider that the UK will be able to manage the security risks of using Huawei technology. What does this mean for Huawei phones and laptops   Nothing, really. The ban only applies to network infrastructure - the equipment that runs internet and phone signals. Huawei phones, tablets and laptops will still be on sale to the public as they were before. Is it safe to buy Huawei devices  Will they still work  Huawei devices will continue to work as they do currently.The big change as a result of US sanctions was that Google apps and the Google Play store are no longer available to use on new Huawei phones.If theyaposre already on your device, they wonapost disappear. But beyond basic security updates, they also wonapost receive any new versions of Googleaposs Android operating system. As far as overall safety is concerned, the decision today - and the cyber security advice - doesnapost apply to consumer goods, only to infrastructure. Officials stress consumer devices present a minimal security risk.What is G  G is the latest - and fastest - type of mobile internet connection. Itaposs around  times faster than G - and more stable as well. The government hopes it can be used to increase mobile internet capacity across the UK, allowing more people to get online without the network slowing down. And the plan is that over time more people will use mobile internet instead of wired connections to their homes - which will allow faster speeds for people in remote areas.

Just hours after Michael Gove told people to use common sense, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to announce the move today in the Commons. Police will be expected to enforce the law - and there will be £ fines for those who refuse. It comes more than two months after the government first recommended wearing a face covering in indoor spaces to prevent passing Covid- to others. But amid mixed messaging, many people are still not wearing them - so Boris Johnson has decided to act. Hereaposs what the new rules will mean and how they will affect you. Where do I need to wear a face covering  Since May , government guidance in England has advised the public to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces, where they may come into contact with people they wouldn’t usually meet. These can include shops and public transport. The use of face coverings became mandatory on public transport in England from June . But until now, the government has refused calls to make them compulsory in shops. Barely  hours ago, Cabinet minister Michael Give urged people to use common sense instead. What is changing  From Friday  July, face coverings will become mandatory in England in shops and supermarkets. This will be written into law and there will be £ fines for those who refuse to wear a mask. Do face coverings actually work   Scientic evidence suggests face coverings help prevent you from passing coronavirus on to other peopleyou are sick. It does not protect you from breathing in the virus unless it is a full-blown piece of medical PPE - something which is not recommended. If you have symptoms, you should be self-isolating at home, but many people get Covid- without symptoms and can spread it rapidly. One SAGE member suggested the virus can linger potent in the air for an hour after being breathed out in an indoor, badly-ventilated space. The UK government initially feared the added risk of handling and fiddling with a face mask could outweigh the benefits. But itaposs performed a U-turn. Face coverings are not, however, a substitute for social distancing - you should do both.  Yes. As with public transport, children under  will not have to wear a face covering. Those who canapost affix a face covering without suffering severe distress, or who have dficulty using it due to a physical or mental disability, are also exempt. It is thought other exemptions will follow the list already used on public transport. These exceptions include anyone who is being relied on by a deaf person for lipreading police or public transport staff emergency responders or people while they are taking medication. Sources suggest there will also be some types of shop that are exempt from the blanket policy. Will it be the law, or just aposguidanceapos  It will be the law. Regulations will be made under the Public HealthAct  - the same law used as the basis for many lockdown restrictions.  The law will define a face covering. This is not a surgical mask and can be a piece of cloth. It must however cover your nose and mouth. The government has a guide to making your own, or they can be bought relatively cheaply from many shops or online. How much can I be fined  Those caught by police contravening the law will be fined £, reducing to £paid within  days. Unlike previous lockdown laws, this £ fine will not double on each repeat offence. It remains fixed at £ each time.

Desmond Swayne hit out despite masks being designed to protect other people, and more than , people dying with coronavirus in the UK - saying it would put him off going to the shops. The -year-old complained he and his constituents in New Forest West were outraged and reluctant and questioned how police would enforce the law. Face coverings will be made mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July  - with exceptions for under-s or certain disabled people. Confirming the move to Parliament, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Let us all do our utmost to keep this virus cornered and enjoy summer safely. But Sir Desmond - who previously covered his face with black paint, said it was fun and refused to apologise - griped: Nothing would make me less likely to go shopping than the thought of having to mask up. Was this consultation with the police force and particularly the chief constable of Hampshire  For it is she that will have to enforce this monstrous imposition against myself and a number of outraged and reluctant constituents. Sir Desmond echoed a string of Tory activists who even cut up their Conservative Party membership cards in protest. The hashtag #NoMasks and the word muzzles were both trending on Twitter on Tuesday morning.  Activists said the order - which carries a maximum fine from police of £ for non-compliance - is incompatible with their libertarian values. Others claimed there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the measure has meaningful health benefits, despite the governmentaposs scientic advisors saying wearing a mask can protect others in enclosed spaces. Dominey Jenner, , a stay-at-home mother and former teacher from Wimbledon, south-west London, told the PA news agency that she had been quite sceptical about the lockdown but said the face mask rules are the final straw. If you look at the statistics regarding the cases and the death rate, which is plummeting... why now you would bring in mandatory face masks  she said.The other strand for me is the libertarian strand. I think people should be trusted, I think we should be given a choice. Iaposm really angry at how the Government has invoked fear in its population to control people - I think that is the wrong way to manage a population and to govern. A recent modelling study from the Universities of Cambridge and Greenwich found that the widespread use of face masks keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below .. Researchers found that even homemade masks with limited effectiveness can dramatically reduce transmission ratesworn by enough people, regardless of whether they show symptoms.  Yet Alistair Haimes, owner of a private investment company who joined the Tories a few months ago, said he is now leaving the party. They think that people will be more confident to go back to shops and officesthey wear them thanthey donapost, he said. I think people should be free to wear them. I just object to being told what to do. He added: People are trying to see the iding lines where they arenapost. People are seeing it as Brexiteer Tories who are against masks. I voted for Tony Blair. I voted Remain. Iaposm not representative of my tribe, as it were.

The girl, from Texas, was taken to intensive care immediately after her birth and tested positive for Covid- the next day. She was suffering from breathing dficulties and a fever, while her mother had already been diagnosed with the disease. An analysis of her placenta found traces of Covid-, proving that the child had caught it while in the womb, instead of after her birth, doctors claim.Dr Amanda Evans said the breakthrough study is the first to document immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence of coronavirus in the placenta. According to Mail Online, the doctor, who contributed to the report, added: Numerous infants have now been delivered to pregnant women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-, with the majority of these infants without respiratory illness or positive molecular evidence for SARS-CoV-.Our study is the first to document intrauterine transmission of the infection during pregnancy, based on immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence of SARS-CoV- infection in the fetal cells of the placenta. The baby was born three weeks premature and initially appeared healthy, although doctors were concerned she could have been infected with coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV- by medical experts.  Her condition deteriorated shortly after her birth, with doctors picking up on mild breathing dficulties and a fever. She received extra oxygen for several days and eventually recovered, being sent home with her mother  days after she was delivered. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center case study, which was published in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, said the evidence aposstrongly suggestsapos the disease was transmitted in the womb.It comes after researchers at the University of Milan found the disease and antibodies in the umbilical cord blood, breast milk, placentas and the vaginas of some pregnant  coronavirus  patients."},{"url":null,"title":"banksy reveals latest coronavirus artwork","story":"NewsBanksy spotted daubing coronavirus artwork on London train in rare public appearanceBanksy donned a hazmat suit and a backpack sprayer for a rare appearance to transform the interior of a London Underground carriage, with the artwork showing rats holding hand sanitiser, sneezing and wearing masksShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video new-banksy-london-underground-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news banksy-reveals-latest-coronavirus-artwork-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Marina shared images of the wedding on Instagram for her army of almost half a million followers.

The bride accompanied the video with the message: We drove to the registry office, I didn’t even have a hairbrush with me. The rings were in the car. There was a good mood and a little embarrassment. Marina said: After the registry office, we dressed in typical wedding attire and enjoyed a nice reception at a local restaurant with several guests.

She said she was overcome with emotion as she watched her unborn baby move in the womb, but Voya did not cry.

Darren Palmer-George said heaposs noticed changes in his three daughters since the start of lockdown, and is terried about the devastating long-term impact it could have. Wheelchair user Darren said he and we Kelly, who has multiple sclerosis, were cut off from vital services in the darkest days of the pandemic - and were unable to properly grieve the death of Kellyaposs dad in March. Darren, , toldheaposs noticed drastic changes in daughters Keira, , Connie, nine, and seven-year-old Pippa - saying that at times it has been toxic. It comes as devastating research found a third of parents believe their children are now isolated and lonely - with some youngsters developing eating disorders during the uncertainty. Darren, who has battled depression since a  accident left him with irreparable damage to his back, told : I hate to think of the damage this is doing. There definitely has to be counselling for children when they go back to school. At the start of this year they were happy-go-lucky, then all of a sudden this happens and bang, the whole world has changed for them. The dad, from Dereham in Norfolk, said Kiera has been getting permanently upset and angry, locking herself in her room.  And he said youngest daughter Pippa now hates being on her own. Itaposs been horric, he said. Weaposve had absolutely no help at all, weaposve been trying to run a family and itaposs been so hard. He said Kelly has struggled following her dadaposs death from a heart attack, and lockdown restrictions meant the family were not able to grieve together. I had to wait in the car while my we was at the crematorium because it was immediate family only, he said. It was horrendous.  His three daughters were only able to say goodbye to their grandfather watching video of the service, unable to hug members of their extended family. Darren said both he and Kelly have used mental health services before the pandemic - but said they were left with no support at the height of the crisis. Darren said: My we has been suffering badly, weaposve had nothing. There isnapost anyone you can talk to straight away. Even before the lockdown, Darren said there were huge shortcomings with mental health support, which he fears will be made worse by the pandemic. He used to attend a dadaposs group at his local Action for Children centre - but that closed last year because of government cuts. As a result, he lost a vital leline. The charity said % of parents theyaposve spoken to worry about their children socialising, with many becoming clingy and unsure and not wanting to go outside.It says demand for parenting advice has risen four-fold in the past three months - prompting it to launch Parent Talk  – a new national online service which connects mums, dads and carers, with trained parenting coaches."},{"url":null,"title":"spinal fluid leak during exercise","story":"NewsSpinal fluid leak during exercise warm up leaves woman, , bed bound in terrible agonyDiane McCracken, from Pontypridd, Wales, suddenly felt one of her vertebrae buckle while was dong some physiotherapy, triggering months of pain that has left the -year-old barely able to moveShareCommentsByMark Smith:,  JUL NewsBefore the freak incident Diane McCracken would run at least four times a week \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Diane McCracken was advised to follow a regime of basic physiotherapy at home in Pontypridd, Wales when she began suffering from minor disc troubles.As she was stretching her neck one evening her vertebrae buckled, Wales Online reported.The -year-old was left in immediate and terrible pain. Two months later doctors discovered that some of the fluid surrounding Dianeaposs spinal cord and brain had leaked into other parts of her body. Since May she has been confined to her bedroom and is now barely able to move. If I stand or sit up, it feels like an elephant is standing on my brain, admitted Diane.The headaches are unlike anything Iaposve ever experienced before. When I lie down they mostly go away, but thereaposs still a terric sense of pressure and tugging.My nose always feels like itaposs congested, my eyes are often burning and my teeth are aching. My mind is never clear. I always feel like Iaposm very much in a fog, and I donapost sleep well at all which is probably down to the condition too. The qualied accountant was physically fit before the injury and would go running with her husband four days a week at least. Her physical condition has changed dramatically since the freak incident in March. When I did it I immediately had pain going up the middle of my head and had a severe screeching sound, she recalled. I felt a strange tingling all over my body. At the time it did worry me but I thought Iaposd probably done something structural. It took me two months to get the diagnosis from a neurologist to realise that it wasnapost structural and there was no damage to any bones or tissue.  A cerebrospinal fluid leak, known as CSF for short, was caused by a tear in her dura mater - a thick membrane that covers and protects the brain and spine. It can cause the brain to sink to the bottom of the skull and lead to severe headaches, nausea, and cognitive issues. The most physically exerting thing Diane can do now is walk four steps to the bathroom and back. From March to May, I was up and still doing things. But over time I found myself, as the days wore on, needing to lie down more and more often, she said. By May, I just felt I couldnapost get up anymore, and now I literally cannot move my head off the pillow. I can go to the toilet but I have to limit the amount of times I do that each day.

The British summer holidays are back after a dreary few weeks, with highs of between C to C forecast for parts of England on Saturday.The southern and south-east are the places to be this weekend for sunbathing this weekend, as the rest of the UK will likely get a dose of cloudy heat, according to the Met Office.The forecast suggests Kent and Suffolk could be in for the winning combination of the highest temperatures and clearest skies this weekend, a meteorologist for the service predicts. While cloud is set to linger in most parts, the forecaster says early predictions suggest the clearest skies and highest temperatures are to be found on Englandaposs eastern coastline. The hottest areas cover counties home to popular beaches Margate, Broadstairs, Whitstable and Dover in Kent. Suffolk county is home to sands covering Southwold and Lowestoft. Some Met Office weather heat maps are predicting highs of C, and a meteorologist says -C is very likely for Englandaposs south and south-east.Another weather map show the hottest temperatures will stretch to the coastline at Southampton to inland spots including London.The summer began with drab and grey skies and followed a wet June. But the sun is due to make an appearance again in days by Thursday as temperatures warm in most parts.  Elsewhere, temperatures should lt into the s by Thursday, except for Scotland and Northern Ireland which should remain cooler. Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said southern Wales and south and south-eastern England should see the highest temperatures. By Saturday, they should lt to C to C across much of southern and southeastern England, she said.  However cloud could linger in the hottest areas, leaving the coastlines of Kent and Suffolk most likely to be clear and sunny and enjoying the high temperatures too. However Ms Diamond stressed that the forecast is subject to change as the week goes on, and any holiday-makers should keep an eye as cloudy conditions could yet persist into the weekend.  Ms Diamond said:Generally this week is going to be pretty on the cloudy side for most, particularly in the north and west parts of the UK, and Northern Ireland and Scotland. That should change as the week goes on, she said. Today, temperatures for southern England are  to C, whereas Friday tmperatures in the south should be in the low to mid-twenties. By Saturday thereaposs a warmer spell and temperatures should be around C-C in south and south east England.  However much of the areas expecting warmer temperature will likely to remain cloudy on Saturday, eastern areas like Kent and Suffolk looked both hot and clear, Ms Diamond added. However that could changethe cloud lingers, she warned anyone planning staycations this weekend. The coming scorcher is one of the first since the heatwaves of the May bank holiday and late June. Temperatures in the final weeks of June were so high, British beaches were overcrowded - triggering major incidents to be declared in some, including Bournemouth and Dover.

Winter may feel a long way off but preparing now for millions of doses is vital as a bombshell report warns of up to , coronavirus deaths – double the current toll. Vaccinating against the flu protects us from that illness, meaning fewer end up in hospital beds, and enables us to be fitter and stronger to fight off the virus. Extending vaccinations to everyone over , as proposed by Labour leader Keir Starmer, is a precaution the Government should embrace. Nothing must be left to chance. The pandemic is a pivotal moment in history and how we respond, inidually and collectively, is crucial. The Government must urge, cajole and persuade specied age groups to go for a jab and it is our duty to turn up. It could be a matter of le or death. Heroes halted Blocking care workers from coming to Britain would be a self-defeating disaster – effectively banning lesaving heroes. Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration rules are reckless political posturing which shamefully ignore the country’s best interests.  When the goal is surely to construct a system that works effectively, locking workers out of vital jobs in a sector with thousands of existing unfilled vacancies makes no sense.

Speaking about aposlawmakers, leaders and executivesapos, Meghan said: They donapost listen until they have to because the status quo is easy to excuse and itaposs hard to break. But it will pull tightest right before snapping.I say to you keep challenging, keep pushing, make them a little uncomfortable. Itaposs only in that discomfort that we actually create the decisions to reimagine our standards, our policies and our leadership, to move towards real representation and meaningful influence over the structures of decision-making and power. She also spoke of the need to aposdrown out the noiseapos of negative voices, even when it aposmakes others feel uneasyapos. The Duchess said: There will always be negative voices and sometimes those voices can appear to be outsized, and sometimes they can appear to be painfully loud. You can and will use your own voices to drown out the noise. Because thataposs what it is - just noise.  But your voices are those of truth. And hope. And your voices can and should be much louder. She also said people need to aposworkapos for apostrue equalityapos every day - and not just believe in it.The -year-old, who was wearing a blue dress and a £, Cartier ct yellow-gold bracelet, added: We have to speak up for ourselves and we have to speak out for others who struggle to be heard.

The covering should be worn over both the mouth and nose - not just one of these.One woman was so fed up of seeing people wearing them in the wrong way that she decided to make a quick TikTok video tutorial on how to properly put one on. To do so, Denise Mejia from Arkansas compared the face covering to a bra, showing how ineffective it is to wear the garment incorrectly.She began by demonstrating how wearing a bra underneath the breasts is like putting a face covering under your chin. Next she shows how letting the face covering hang off of one ear is as useless as wearing a bra only on one breast. Denise also compared wearing a mask on your forehead to wearing a bra on your chest above your boobs - totally pointless!  Finally she highlighted how wearing the covering over the mouth but under the nose was also incorrect, before placing it in the right position and adjusting the bra to match.

The Chinese government has been accused of trying to silence anyone who had earlier tried to raise the alarm before the killer bug became a pandemic earlier this year which has killed , people globally as of Monday. Dr Yan wants to expose the Chinese government saying they knew about the novel coronavirus before publicly acknowledging the outbreak. Speaking to journalist Bill Hemmer, Dr Yan said “we don’t have much time”. This is a huge pandemic we have seen in the world, she said. ”Itaposs more than anything weaposve known in human history. So, the timing is very, very important. If we can stop it early, we can save lives. She said she feared for her leshe spoke out while she was in China so fled to the US where she is currently hiding at secret location. She told Fox News: “The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid.  If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it I will be disappeared and killed. Dr Yan said she was among the first scientists asked to investigate a small number of cases of a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December  of last year. She claimed the Chinese Communist Party and senior university staff censored evidence that Covid- could be transmitted between humans as early as last December. “The China government refused to get overseas experts, even including ones in Hong Kong, to do research in China, she said.  So I turned to my friends to get more information. She said she spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinaaposs Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and told them about the unknown virus. She also told them she had identied members of the same family had caught the virus which indicated there was a human-to-human transmission. Dr Yan also told that the number of cases was thought to be rising exponentially but when she took her findings to her bosses she was told to keep silent and be careful.  He warned me..., aposDonapost touch the red lineapos, she said. aposWe will get in trouble and weaposll be disappearedapos. Dr Yan said she believes that crucial information could have said lives while the Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including those from Hong Kong, conduct research in Wuhan. “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus, she warned.  She added that she has records of communications with others in China, and she does fear for her le. There have been claims that doctors in China have been detained by the government for speaking out about what they have witnessed on social media. Journalists have allegedly been harassed and had their equipment seized after trying to report on the issue. Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter from police before he died.  The whistleblower was warned thathe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by coronavirus. Dr Yan said: She said: “I know how they treat whistleblowers.” [They want] To keep people silentthey want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-, but also for the other things happening in China.” I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the US Government.” She added: “And I want them to understand, and I also want the US people to understand how terrible this is.

Police hope to find Carpentier, who is separated from the girlsapos mother, alive, as he is the only one who can clearly explain the events leading up to their deaths. Sergeant Ann Mathieu said officers are now focusing on the heavily wooded area after officers found objects there Sunday, leading them to believe Carpentier is nearby.  Itaposs not impossible that heaposs still alive, but we have to consider that, with the time passing by, maybe heaposs not, Sgt Mathieu said. Weaposre still searching. We never saw Martin Carpentier. We never had any contact with him. The information that we possess is related to the citizens that report having seen him.Mr Carpentieraposs girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, on Twitter.Martin, weaposre worried. We havenapost heard anything from you since the accident. We want to knowyouaposre okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah, she said.We want to knowtheyaposre okay...youaposre okay. Give us some news, let us know, call your parents, whatever it is. The important thing is that youaposre all all right. We just want to know youaposre all right.

The mystery sign is supposedly the horoscope of those born between November  and December . Andit was used as an official star sign today it would sht horoscopes for the rest of the year, meaning the one you have been following may actually be wrong. For example Pisces is February  to March  but could potentially actually be March  to April . NASA published the findings in a blog post in January  based on claims from the Babylonians who looked into the zodiac in a bid to try to understand the planet. However news of Ophiuchus has since re-emerged and got a lot of people talking. The space agency wrote that the Babylonians knew the signs didn’t fit perfectly with the earth’s rotation. The Babylonians lived over , years ago, the blog post reads. They ided the zodiac into  equal parts - like cutting a pizza into  equal slices. They picked  constellations in the zodiac, one for each of the  aposslices.apos But even according to the Babyloniansapos own ancient stories, there were  constellations in the zodiac. . “So the Babylonians picked one, Ophiuchus, to leave out. “Even then, some of the chosen  didnapost fit neatly into their assigned slice of the pie and slopped over into the next one.However, the matter is a complicated one. As the earth’s axis wobbles and constellations y in size, it’s impossible for the sun to spend the same amount of time in each star sign. In short, estimations aren’t perfect and there is always some room for error. At the time the findings were published, there was uproar on social media sites, with some astrology fans claiming their lives had been ruined as a result of the supposed potential changes. Phil Plait, writing for New Scientist, poured cold water on the claims by exposing exactly how the star sign system worked, and what had been left out by experts. He said: The thing is, there are more than  constellations the Sun can pass through. Some are smaller, or have fainter stars, so they get ignored. The biggest is Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, which is a huge constellation taking up quite a bit of celestial real estate, and in fact the sun spends more time in Ophiuchus than Scorpius. Scorpius has brighter stars and an obvious scorpion-like shape, so it gets better press. He explained at the time in , that NASA didnapost add Ophiuchus or change the zodiac system, but it had been ignored by astrologers, who he said should take the blame for all this, not actual scientists.

A super effort so far!The postponement of the Ryder Cup until next year is just adding insult to injury now for this sports writer’s summer plans.First the Euros are pushed back until  and now this  I might have to actually get a le.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The player is set toto training with team-mates this week.Aberdeen’s pre-season preparations ramped up at the weekend with the bounce game draw with Ross County.That friendly marked the first appearance of winger Jonny Hayes, who signed a two-year deal following his exit from Celtic.The deal to land the -year-old was only made possible because the Republic of Ireland international offered to defer his wages for a year.Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has illustrated the financial plight of the club, confirming projected losses of £m due to the Covid- pandemic.Due to that financial hit, McInnes is currently not in a position to add to the squad.Cormack is this week expected to unveil the club’s plan to navigate through the pandemic.The imminent Premiershipand hope of a phasedof fans at least offers light at the end of the tunnel.McInnes is mindful of just how long his squad have been away.He said: “From that Hibs gameto the start of the season against Rangers, it will be the best part of five months.“That is a long time, probably the longest any squad has had that gap from competitive football.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

The Argyll and Bute Climate Change group challenged me to make sure that I didn’t get into the habit of seeing this as a single issue but rather one that impacts absolutely everything I do at Westminster, from economic recovery planning, to defence and security, human rights and international affairs.#If there is a silver lining to this awful COVID- pandemic it is that going forward, we can do things dferently as iniduals, as a country, internationally and of course, globally. And its an opportunity we must take.#Mr O#Hara referenced the group and their meeting on the floor of the House of Commons the following day, when he asked the Secretary of State for Transport about the group#s dismay that #once again the UK Government had missed almost every one of on its emissions targets#.#We are very fortunate that our MP Brendan O’Hara understands the urgency of the climate crisis, and is open to some of our suggestions,# said -year-old Rowan Aitchison.He continued: #We desperately need to retire GDP as a measure of our wellbeing and work towards a system that allows people to live a fulfilling le. Scotland is one of very few countries that have made a start on this, pioneering a government system which is based on a wellbeing economy. We need to accept that money is not the key to human happiness, and start putting our wellbeing before increasing our profit margins.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPeople remarked on the freshness of the air.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

He was a keen amateur photographer and tucked inside the pages were six of his photographs of Palmyra, all carefully captioned on the back.Family treasures uncovered during lockdown donrsquot come much better than this. Jamesrsquos words, written in the present tense, are marvellously evocative, capturing the excitement of the journeyrsquos end and the jaw-dropping sight of the ruins dating back to the st and nd centuries. Reading it now, we feel wersquore right there, standing beside him.Palmyra was devastated in  and  when Isis took control of the area, their systematic attempt to destroy the ancient site was described by the UN as a war crime. Now the Syrian government is working to restore the Unesco World Heritage Site.These are Jamesrsquos reflections on the city when he visited nearly  years ago.ldquoHalte, stop. Nouvelle Palmyre. To the weary and dust-stained traveller approaching Palmyra from the desert, these signs are welcome. Palmyra at last.Only  hours before, the lights of Baghdad,  miles away across the Syrian desert, had winked farewell. Powerful touring cars with running boards laden with baggage almost to the height of the hood, travelling all through the night and a great part of the next day, had spanned the barren expanse of desert.An uneventful journey, it is only when watches indicate that Palmyra should be somewhere on the horizon there is any interest. Every distant mound is the subject of speculation until, at last, the sun on its western course throws into relief a dark irregular shape, which very slowly resolves into patches of light, shade and straight lines recognisable as buildings.ldquoPalmyra, says the Syrian driver, ldquohalf hour.Then on through New Palmyra, a French-Arab town. Turns and twists through the narrow side streets allow occasional glimpses of the ancient city beyond and prepare for what is to come. A sharp turn to the right past a police post and there it lies ndash Queen Zenobiarsquos famous city, lonely yet magnicent even in the chaos of its ruins.The Palmyra of old may have been named the City of Palms but there are few palm trees to be seen nowadays. One sees it only as a veritable city of columns. They cover the area in reckless confusion. Some rear proud heads  or  feet in the air, as erect as the day they were set up  centuries ago. Those upstanding bear marvellously, but precariously, enormous stone blocks, which span from column to column.Hundreds, alas, lie prone, the weathered yellow stone giving some semblance to huge cornstalks, asa giant reaper had been at work. Short columns, long columns, columns in their several parts are strewn over the area in rank profusion.In this barren desert there is no lichen, moss or clinging ivy to cloak or protect the nakedness of the ruins and time has dealt out very uneven treatment. Generally the yellow stones are pitted and scarred by the violent blasts of prevailing sandstorms. In many places, the delicate carvings on the columns are almost as sharp and clear as the day they were cut. While in others, the carvings are completely eroded.Built into each column is a bracket which originally carried a statue. These were erected to honour those who, braving the perils of the desert, led the wealth-laden caravans safely from India and Persia. Every such successful venture brought wealth and renown to Palmyra and its commemoration in stone also, materially, helped to build the city.The total number of columns has never been computed, but some indication of Palmyrarsquos success in trading may be gained from the statement of a French surveyor working on the site that there were  columns in the mile-long Great Colonnade alone.All over the area stand out isolated groups which possibly, originally, were attached to some public building or perhaps lined some of the minor streets.Out of all the chaos, stands one orderly array ndash the Grand Colonnade. Viewed from the Arc de Triomphe, the dangerous state of which is now being remedied by the French authorities, the eye travels from column to column - now upright, now fallen ndash with the gaps scarcely noticeable from this viewpoint to where, over a mile away, a French military post crowns the highest of the range of hills under the shelter of which Palmyra nestles snugly.The eye travels back to where, at the foot of the hills and extending into a valley to the left, stand the square-built tomb towers, each of which must have been six or seven storeys high, where the dead of Palmyra were buried. Most of the tiered tombs have collapsed, but above the shroud of mist rising from the sulphurous springs in the valley, some stand out ndash dead reminders of Palmyrarsquos living greatness.Behind and to the left are the ruins of the main public buildings, including the marketplace and the great temple erected to the worship of the Sun God. The same sun which has witnessed all the splendours of the ancient city but now lights only an abandoned stage.To the thoughtful traveller, the journey of  hours across the desert from Baghdad to Palmyra conjures up visions of the old caravan route and brings acute realisation of the reasons for Palmyrarsquos one-time existence.The old-time caravans counted the rising and the setting of the sun  times before nearing Palmyra. One can visualise them plodding on, and ever on, to the west the slow, deliberately stepping camels and the jerky, trotting mules laden with bales of valuable merchandise, gold and precious stones. The great silence of the desert broken only by the soft pad, pad of the hoofs and the tinkle of the bells round the animalsrsquo necks.Day after day, jogging along in the great heat of the desert. Night after night, huddled round the campfire in the shelter of piled-up bales of goods, for the desert nights can be bitterly cold. Day and night, the never-ceasing vigilance to guard against not only the natural dangers of the desert but the possibility of attack by marauding tribes.One can imagine with what joy the first sight of the Palmyra hills would be welcomed. The anxieties and sleepless watchfulness would soon be over. The dawn of another day would see them safe in the desert city. Then the triumphant procession of the caravan down the long colonnade to the acclamation of the citizens, past the statues in honour of those who had previously accomplished a similar task or perhaps died in the attempt.These were the men who built up the splendour of Palmyra and brought untold wealth to Queen Zenobia. Her city became the trading centre of the East her people were the recognised carriers of merchandise between India or Persia and the Mediterranean.But Zenobia was not content. Her lust for gold and power was insatiable. She sought to throw off the shackles of dependency on Rome and found an empire of her own. For a time, indeed, she did reign as undisputed Queen of the East but the might of the Roman Emperor, Aurelian, ultimately shattered her dreams.The desert queen was taken captive to Rome where, decked out in wonderful jewels and almost fainting under the weight of the gold chains of captivity, she was led in processions through the streets. Her greed for gold led to her undoing.So long as Palmyra was in the throes of war, the trade caravans avoided it, seeking and establishing safer routes to the south. This led to the cityrsquos commercial decay and now it stands a lonely, pitul ruin on a deserted trade route.The strong light of the sun on the yellow columns turns the whole scene to gold, asin mockery of the ruins, as the car proceeds towards the gap in the hills which leads to Damascus. Then on through the valley where the silent tomb towers, like ghostly sentinels, watch the traveller depart this city of the dead, while overhead the same sun they worshipped vaunts its eternal existence, emphasising the futility of man and the mercilessness of time."},{"url":null,"title":"first-drive-volkswagen-e-up","story":"WHAT IS IT In the race to gain the EV top-spot, it seems many manufacturers have forgotten that often the best application of electric technology is in smaller city cars. After all, the current crop of EVs are quite large Jaguars I-Pace is huge, for instance, while Audis e-Tron is a dominating force out on the road. Then there is the myriad of crossovers like the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Soul Electric, which are reasonably large too.But the Volkswagen e-Up! is dferent. Its quite small - as is the standard Up! - and it doesnt look all too out-there either. VW has given the e-Up! bigger batteries to improve that all-important range - but can this little car battle it out in a segment dominated by leviathans WHATS NEW If you were to judge whats new by the exterior of the e-Up!, youd probably say not a lot. It doesnt look particularly dferent from the car it replaces, nor does it appear all too dissimilar to the standard combustion-engined car. No, the bulk of the changes here have been made under the skin.As we mentioned earlier, Volkswagen has boosted the battery count in the e-Up!, helping to extend its range and bolster its appeal. The firm has also added the ability to fast-charge the car - a feature more often seen in premium alternatives - which should help to drive down the time youll be waiting at the plug.WHATS UNDER THE BONNET Underneath the e-Up! sits an electric motor linked to a .kWh battery. Power is sent to the front wheels through a single-speed gearbox, and in total it pushes out .bhp but, more importantly, a healthy Nm of torque - but well get to the effect that has shortly.Sprinting from -mph takes the Up! . seconds and all-in itll do mph. Volkswagen claims that youll be able to do  miles between charges, while the ability to use combined charging system tech means that the car can be taken from zero to % charge in just an hour via a kW DC charger. Use a standard domestic wallbox and that falls to a respectable four hours, while via a three-pin youll be looking at around  hours for a full charge.WHATS IT LIKE TO DRIVE The little Up! is already an absolute hoot to drive, so youd hope that some of that sense of fun had been transplanted across to the electric version. And, despite weighing in at ,kg - well over the regular cars kg - it is. That sense of fun remains, with the zippy acceleration you only get from an EVs instant torque really adding to the whole experience. The steering is well-judged and nicely weighted while the ride is good too, with only the largest of potholes tending to unsettle it.Around town, its nimble and makes slotting into gaps in traffic a breeze and even at higher speeds on the motorway, its unflustered. Surprisingly for an EV, acceleration from mph to mph isnt bad at all - many electric cars tend to start getting a touch lethargic at this point.HOW DOES IT LOOK We already liked the understated styling of the standard Up!, so its fair to say that we appreciate the undercover looks of this electric version too. Only slim LED running lights up front help to denote it as something dferent to the norm, while the charging port is integrated into the place youd usually find the filler cap. All very normal indeed.The compact proportions lend the Up! to town driving, while the short overhangs and relatively slim wheel arches make it a doddle to park. In terms of electric vehicle design, it certainly rests on the conservative end of things, but were sure that this will appeal to many.WHATS IT LIKE INSIDE Again, much like the exterior, the cabin of the e-Up! is business as usual. Theres no main infotainment screen - just a cradle for your smartphone - so the forward part of the interior feels pleasantly uncluttered. The steering wheel has a good amount of adjustment, while the seats are well-padded and comfortable. Theres good forward visibility too - though on brighter days the windscreen does tend to reflect a large vent located at the back of the dashboard, which can prove quite distracting.Our five-door model granted easy access to the rear of the car too, and those who are sat in the back that wont struggle for legroom - though of course, the cars size does have its limitations. Very tall passengers will likely find headroom a hard-to-find aspect of the Up!WHATS THE SPEC LIKE Our test car came in at pound, after the governments plug-in car grant, which doesnt seem like bad value at all given the kit on offer. Cruise control, parking sensors at both front and rear and a rearview camera are all thrown in as standard, while a dinky five-inch colour touchscreen system - essentially a small strip screen - houses Bluetooth connectivity and DAB radio.Volkswagen also - importantly - includes two charging cables, one amp unit for use at wallboxes and charge points and another amp cable for charging at the mains.VERDICTThe plucky e-Up! has hit the nail on the head. No, it cant deliver the headline ranges boasted by larger EVs, but with around  miles per charge it can offer a genuinely useable range. Short trips to town and even longer journeys will unlikely trouble the bottom end of the range, while that ability to fast charge means thatyou do need to plug in, you wont be waiting all that long.Most importantly, however, the e-Up! is fun, and thats certainly an aspect which many EVs have missed from the process of driving.FACTS AT A GLANCEModel: Volkswagen e-Up!Price as tested: pound, Engine: Electric motor with batteriesPower: .bhpTorque: NmMax speed: mph-mph: . secondsMPG: N AEmissions:  g km CORange:  miles"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-fond-memories-maestro","story":"Johnny knew how to work both a stage and an audience.

Support for independence does appear to have ticked up, but the change in Nicola Sturgeon, in public at least, has also been interesting, partly because not all of her supporters are entirely happy about it.The change was clear right from the beginning of the crisis. Before coronavirus, the First Minister was still talking about an independence referendum this year, even though no one believed it any more. But, to her credit, she stopped talking about it and said her focus was on the health crisis instead. She said something similar to Andrew Marr on Sunday, which, as Marr pointed out, has led to the weird situation of everyone talking about independence more than the leader of the SNP.:Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence  Some in the SNP arent so sure | Opinion: Iain MacwhirterBut behind the scenes, Ms Sturgeonrsquos political brain is still ticking away, and her calculation is that by not talking about independence she actually increases support for it. In other words, banging on about independence all the time can turn people off, whereas handling a crisis competently ndash but more importantly giving the impression yoursquore handling it competently ndash can increase support. Ms Sturgeon refers to the strategy as ldquoshow not tell and letrsquos face it: itrsquos working to some extent.The question is whether it will hold, and the signs are not all good. On her right flank, some critics seem to have a go at the First Minister whatever happens and appear to think she should have followed the UK strategy word-for-word. Meanwhile, on the left flank some of her own supporters think her strategy on independence is much too slow and comfortable for a supposedly radical movement. They ache and agitate for something more dramatic.As for Nicola Sturgeon herself, she says she now takes a dferent view of the situation and letrsquos take her word on it for now. Talking to Alastair Campbell in The New European, she said she had a sense she would not be coming out of the crisis the same as she went into it. ldquoIt is probably lowering my tolerance to some of the nonsense of politics, she said. ldquoI know how important rigorous debate is, but a lot of modern politics is not about that, itrsquos just about chucking mud at each other and forcing yourself to believe the worst of your opponents.Ms Sturgeon admitted that the change might not last and that there was a chance she might go back to her old ways once the crisis is over ndash we all might. But I suspect shersquos not alone in her re-assessment of how the arguments over independence have been framed. The last six aggressive and angry years have been exhausting and the First Ministerrsquos approach encouraged it. The hope now ndash and I accept it may be a vain hope ndash is that her more recent tone and behaviour can be a model for the future.A little look back at the past might also help. The th anniversary of the  European referendum has just been and gone and a look at the campaigns is enlightening. The question was ldquoDo you think the UK should stay in the European Community  and both sides resorted to apocalyptic language. The In campaign warned of food shortageswe came out of the common market, while the Out campaign warned that British wealth would ldquobleed away within the market and that the UK would be forced to ldquomerge with France and become a single state.Forty-five years on, we can now see those warnings for what they were: hysterical rubbish, but there were more reasonable voices among the voters. For example, on referendum day itself, the comic writer Michael Palin was still wrestling with the options in his diary: stay in Europe and, in his words, keep up with the pace of material progress in France and Germany, or break from Europe and become an independent trader. But itrsquos what Palin said next that makes most sense: ldquoNeither decision involves the downfall of our nation. Once there is a decision it will all be absorbed into the system and the country will carry on workingas it always did.:The border skirmish that signals a new battle of the Union | Analysis: David LeaskThat still makes a lot of sense and could work as a blueprint for how we should all think in referendums to come, including any referendum on Scottish independence. The last referendum in  was nasty, with lots of the mud-slinging Nicola Sturgeon referred to , but a big part of the problem was the extreme positions. The No side said thatScotland was independent, all our money would blow up and alien crabs would suck our brains out through our eyeballs, while the Yes side said wersquod all be sitting by the pool in   sunshine counting our piles of self-generating cash. Not quite. But not far off.The point is we need to be resistant to that kind of hysteria in future. There are concerns about debt in an independent Scotland and how the border would work, but the reality is Scotland would not have independence in any total sense: our ability to be autonomous would be limited just as it is for every other nation. In other words: the country will largely carry on workingas it always did.I accept some nationalists will not like that idea ndash theyrsquore still in love with   sunshine. But for some unionists and centrists, perhaps it could form the basis of a coping mechanism. As I said to my colleague, independence is not inevitable. But perhaps,therersquos a little less mud and a little less hysteria, some of those who oppose independence might just start getting their head round the idea.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

Why have so many native Gaelic speakers chosen not to pass on their first language to their children  One answer is they decided the language was a hindrance, rather than a asset for their childrens future employment prospects, as they perceived it had been for them. Until this mindset is changed, the decline in numbers speaking the language will continue.The solution is increased use of the Gaelic, as a transactional language, spoken in shops, churches, public service buildings and the Scottish Parliament. This is the only way the value of Gaelic will be increased amongst its native speakers. This process could be started immediately by the SNP Government and its Gaelic speaking MSPs Kate Forbes and Alisdair Allan using the language in their workplace of Holyrood, frequently. The remaining native Gaelic speakers need to urgently validate Gaelic by using it in their workplaces. I believe this is the only way to save Gaelic as a living language.Iain Campbell, Dollar.I READ Alistair Grants article in support of retaining the use of the Gaelic language hoping to understand the need for its retention and was left feeling that he simply shot himself in the foot.He mentions the research which prophesies the danger of the day-to-day use of Gaelic dying out by the end of the decade and the fact that English is more usually spoken in families where both parents are Gaelic speakers.Now retired, I can count on one hand the Gaelic speakers I have met in my letime and like many others was rather surprised when our place names and department buildings were given Gaelic sub-titles.

The sensible thing now would be to talk to them.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.THROUGHOUT this pandemic a group of contributors to your Letters Pages have routinely found fault with the actions of our First Minister in dealing with the Covid- virus. Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of going too slowly she has been accused of going too quickly. She has been accused of simply copying actions taken by Downing Street and she has been accused of taking Scotland on a dferent path from that being pursued in England. She is damnedshe does and she is damnedshe does not. Things though must be pretty desperate for her criticsour First Minister is now attacked for her choice of personal protection. The letter by Dr Edwardssuggesting that for Nicola Sturgeon to wear a tartan face covering is somehow politicising the pandemic is frankly risible. He claims that she aspires to be some sort of \"super heroine\" on a mission to \"save Scotland\". What nonsense.There are two problems for Dr Edwards and his fellow-critics. Firstly he should read the Daily Update figures printed each day on Page  of The Herald. Here he will see the dramatic fall in the number of infections recorded in Scotland over the past weeks added to that the fact that at the time of writing, for the last five days there have been no deaths attributable to the virus. If he casts his eye further down to look at the UK figures. then he will see quite a dferent story. Frankly I find it depressing that the undoubted success achieved thus far by the Scottish Government working with our NHS and care workers in suppressing the virus is never acknowledged by critics such as Dr Edwards.The other problem for such critics is the fact that the steady, thoughtful, progress being charted through this pandemic by the Scottish Government, and so clearly articulated by Nicola Sturgeon, has won the support of the vast majority of Scots.There are more than enough examples of the failings of the UK Government to keep your correspondents busy just now. Your report in the same issue that since January of this year some , children have been admitted to English hospitals suffering from the effects of malnutrition is truly shocking. This scandal has now been followed by details of the new immigration policy for the post-Brexit UK . This will hit hard key Scottish industries such as hospitality, tourism and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a shameful way to treat the large numbers of our migrant care workers on whom we have come to depend, several of whom have lost their lives during this crisis.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I HAVE taken to summarising Guy Stenhouses articles, to save me reading them in future, and perhaps saving him from writing them.His summary of governmental responses to Covid  is: Scottish Government bad, Westminster Government good.He is right that patients were sent from hospital to residential care without Covid testing Business, July , but no one was discharged with symptoms.It was not known at the time that asymptomatic patients would spread the disease so effectively. The lack of a crystal ball was present throughout the UK and patients were discharged from hospitals in England in the same circumstances. Strange that Mr Stenhouse is not also asking for Matt Hancocks head on a plate.Its also unfortunate that Boris Johnsons announcement of compulsory face masks in shops came too late for his article. Otherwise, he could have pointed out that Nicola Sturgeon was again following the Westminster line, and that Boris had preceded her by at least minus  days.Sam Craig, Glasgow G.THE letter from your correspondent L MacGregormust be an attempt to break the world record for the number of exaggerations, deliberate distortions, misrepresentation and downright lies that can be fitted into a single missive. In a way we should perhaps thank her for her summing up of the tissue of mendacity upon which the case for Scottish independence so heavily relies.These range from the insistence on best-case scenariosto utter fantasyvia financial irresponsibilityto that good old favourite the Independence Time Machine , throwing in for good measure the wilful misrepresentation of the devolved fisheries border of  as an oil field border. The rest of the claims in the letter are also rubbish of the same order.The SNP has recently been advised by a tame academic professor of marketing to abandon facts and tell stories instead ndash a lesson learned from Donald Trump and Aaron Banks and his successful Brexit campaign . Its followers are obviously quick learners.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.AFTER the human misery and predictable economic failure of a partitioned East Germany, West Germany paid heavily for the reunication, investing billions into the East. If Scotland ever becomes independent and when it inevitably failsit can expect no such support from England because of the toxic anti-English rhetoric that is the default position of the economic theory-free zone of the nationalists. Broke and desperate, our future will for sure be as a recipient of ldquoaid from Moscow or Beijing. Can I suggest that even Boris Johnson is preferable to Putin or Xi Jinping John Dunlop, Ayr.IN response to Janice MacKay , Scotland was a country long before most of the present countries of Europe and for some centuries before the United was cobbled together from the ious territories stolen from the inhabitants. Scotland is an inidual country just as England is, and the fact that it is shackled to England by an unfair Treaty of Union does not negate its existence as a nation. When devolution was eventually prised out of Westminster, some small elements of government were restored to Scotland in the hope that this gesture would prevent the natives becoming any more restless. It did not work.Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh EH.WE are currently bombarded in the media by the views of experts. My Chambers dictionary defines an expert as one who is skilled in any art or science.In his letter today , Douglas Cowe rightly places the word \"experts\" in inverted commas.After listing the supposed benefits of Scottish independence, L McGregor recommends that I read some of the work of true experts, whatever that means, like Dr Tim Rideout. Dr Rideout speaks, of course, in favour of an independent Scotland. Some \"experts\" lean to the political left, some to the right, some to unionism and some to Scottish nationalism.One can iniably find an \"expert\" who happens to suit ones own political leanings.Experts as defined by Chambers are, after all, human.David Miller, Milngavie.THE figures quoted by your columnist Kirsty Hughesto the effect that  per cent of Scottish voters ndash versus % in England ndash would wish to rejoin the EU seems to show that there has been little change in the disposition of overall electoral views regarding Brexit.However, it must lay to rest one belief held by some Remainers: that the narrow margin of victory for Leave in the referendum was due to the larger dferential turnout of elderly voters.Just over four years have passed since the referendum. Plenty of opportunity for members of this cohort to die off, especially since the elderly have been disproportionately affected by Covid-.Perhaps the desire to leave the EU is more widely dfused than previously thought.Christopher W Ide, WaterfootRead more: Former SNP MSP Dave Thompson to quit party to form new party, Alliance for Independence"},{"url":null,"title":"expansion-plan-promises-new-lease-life-hidden-oasis","story":"But Blawhorn Moss National Nature Reserve in West Lothian is one of our environmental crown jewels ndash a hidden oasis where species such as the dragonfly-eating sundew, heath spotted orchid and curlew can be found.It is also a rare survivor of the lowland raised bogs once common across central Scotland.Now the reserversquos profile is set for a huge boost after plans were unveiled that will see the site expanded, a new boardwalk and circular paths put in, and work undertaken aimed at restoring the peatlands as part of efforts to preserve their climate changefighting properties.It is also hoped the work announced by Scottish Natural Heritagewill put Blawhorn Moss on the eco-tourism map alongside locations such as the Flow Country, helping it become a visitor magnet and adding to the already marked increase in walkers since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced.ldquoMany of the National Nature Reserves we look after are the big iconic ones up in the Highlands and we have relatively few in the Central Belt, said David Pickett, SNHrsquos reserve manager.ldquoBut Blawhorn is only a half-hour drive from Edinburgh.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

And in addition to Mel Gibson#s epic offering, Gary said that there are plans to host another two films in August as well as a spooktacular screening in October.#Because the event was so popular, we have organised another two on nd and rd of August as well.#After that, we have plans to screen movies on Halloween # we#ll probably show a family-type film such as Ghostbusters # because it will be darker earlier # and then we#ll be able to show a classic horror film at midnight, which will be really cool!#: #As a big film fan I’ve been known to travel hundreds of miles to see a particular film, so the opportunity to see a classic like Back to the Future at a drive-in cinema on Skye was an unmissable cultural event. #This is a film which as a nine-year-old I saw five times in the cinema and have lost count how many times I’ve seen it since. #This event proved just how vital, uplting, and unique the cinema experience can be, and one which we will all remember for years to come. #I can’t wait until the next time!#The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210341.jpg--.jpg?1593777277000\n","title":"buick pupils efforts earn school an eco flag honour","story":"Buick Memorial Primary School in Cullybackey has been awarded a prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag by the environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautul. The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This can include a piece of paper towel or silk.If you make a pocket in the middle of the mask the paper towel slip can be changed every time it is washed.How do I fit my mask properly Have it tightly fitting in order to block droplets coming from the mouth.It also needs to fit around the chin and cheeks.

But this spending only applies to Britain.Mr Gove said the investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities when the transition period ends in December. The £m package includes £m for staffing and IT systems, and £m for port and inland infrastructure. New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place. The funding relates only to the implementation of the GB-EU border, and the Government will publish specic guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks. Mr Gove said: We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and signicant opportunities for which we all need to prepare. That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will continue to abide by EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods. Ports here are ready to build border control points, but are still waiting for the green light from Stormont. Meanwhile, new Taoiseach Micheal Martin also said more detail is needed on arrangements following Brexit, and expressed concern about the signicant ergences remaining between the EU and the UK on a post-Brexit trade agreement. I think there has been some progress in terms of a paper that the UK Government published, but we do need more detail, we need more precision. I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and the United Kingdom in relation to Brexit, he said. I had a very fruitful discussion with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson after I took office. I think we both agreed that it#s in everybody#s interest, particularly in terms of businesses and giving them certainty, that we get a good comprehensive trade deal between the UK and European Union.Belfast Most ReadTwelfth : Thousands turn out for almost  parades across NI PSNI investigates Belfast band’s parade restrictions breachTwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Malachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesTwelfth  #successful# but concern over crowding ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But you also need to really concentrate and focus and Jules did that too.The Matterhorn Museum in Zermatt told Chris that Jules is the youngest person ever to climb the mountain, but it#s not something that the youngster is hugely bothered about.Jules is just happy to have successfully climbed a mountain that has claimed the lives of adults and professional climbers, the Skettrick Island man said. Just to have done it is incredible. It#s a nice thing that he#s the youngest but he#s not fixated on that.The Matterhorn, shaped like a pyramid, is the sixth highest mountain in Europe. It#s also the equivalent height of five #Munros# .Over  people have died while attempting to climb the peak. Tragically, a -year-old man lost his le during the Molyneauxs# climb.The Matterhorn is one of the deadliest peaks in the world, the father-of-two said.On the day of the climb it was dangerous. There was more snow than our guide has seen in  years, and there were lots of falling rocks.There was always a question mark as to whether it would be possible to reach the summit, because it#s not easy. A lot of people try and fail, and a lot of people obviously die on the mountain.One of the  climbers who left the hut with us was coming behind us on the way down and he slipped and fell m.He died and had be collected by helicopter. It#s so treacherous.For two years Jules had been dreaming of tackling the Matterhorn, ever since he competed a school project on the famous mountain.Ardvreck School in Perth and Kinross, which Jules attends, is outdoor-focused and it has been so supportive, said Chris.The former professional snowboarder, who has an older son Louis , said he still spends a lot of time in Northern Ireland when he#s not at his Scottish distillery base, where Daffy#s Gin is made.I was born and lived most of my le on Skettrick Island and we were always outdoors in the countryside, he said.Growing up, I spent a lot of time in the Mournes. I loved climbing trees and I also used to climb Skettrick Castle.The Campbell College past pupil said his love for climbing was nurtured the whole way through school as a member of the mountaineering club, meaning he#s well-placed for his son#s next goal.Jules is talking about tackling the north face of the Eiger, which is one of the most extreme climbs in the world, he said.When askedJules is a bit of a daredevil, Chris replied: I wouldn#t say that. He loves climbing. But for now we#ll just chill out, enjoy the summer and see what happens.

Males accounted for the higher proportion of absenteeism, with  men taking sick leave for stress, anxiety or depression in the three years period compared to  females.Read MoreEditor#s Viewpoint:Opinion NI ambulance staff deserve protection, as  staff took time off in three years due to work-related stressOf these  were paramedics who were recorded on the Health and Social Care Trust#s Human Resources, Payroll, Travel and Subsistence systemas having been absent from work due to stress, anxiety or depression. Meanwhile, six female officers staff members required sick leave for post-natal health concerns in the past three years.Commenting to the figures, a spokesperson for NIAS said the service recognised that signicant psychological and emotional stress is being experienced by staff in their frontline, control and support duties.We are committed to supporting all staff to the maximum extent, the spokesperson said.Some stresses are naturally associated with a first responder service like NIAS. However, these stresses can be intensied by factors such as assaults on staff, resource shortages, dficulties with sht patterns or meal breaks, the pressure of generational health crises like Covid-, and also, personal issues.Recognising such factors, NIAS began a Wellbeing Partnership with trade unions in November . This work has sought to normalise and address psychological and emotional health issues, and to encourage openness among all staff about these realities.NIAS said that since then, a range of support measures has been developed, including: training and guidance around wellbeing and resilience ious health and wellbeing events and initiatives across the Trust commencement of a Health and Wellbeing Project Manager in April  establishment of a staff-led Peer Support project, to which two staff have been seconded since August  and participation in the regional psychological support services framework launched by the Minister for Health in April .The NIAS spokesperson added: In particular, Peer Support has provided a signicant psychological first-aid and signposting service to staff following the most traumatic incidents of the past  months.This project has developed links with partners across the UK and Ireland, working closely with PSNI and HSC colleagues, as well as international experts.During the most serious weeks of Covid-, over  Covid-related staff contacts were proactively initiated by Peer Support to help staff. A review of Occupational Health provision is currently ongoing. The need for additional resources and expert psychological support has already been identied.Recently, an increase in attacks against staff has caused even greater trauma and added stress to our teams. These attacks need to stop.Last month the NIAS revealed that assaults on ambulance staff soared to  incidents in May after dropping signicantly during the March and April lockdown.Some of the incidents involved patients spitting at NIAS crews, urinating over equipment and telling staff that they had coronavirus and intended to pass it on to them.As a result of the Covid- restrictions on movement, ambulance crews had been at a lesser risk of assault in public places -but since the easing of the regulations, physical and verbal attacks have surged.A spokesman for the Unison union, which represents the overwhelming majority of Ambulance Service staff, added: Unison has been working constructively with the NIAS in an innovative partnership project to protect and improve the health and wellbeing of all staff, given the particular levels of stress faced by these key workers.

Pic Pacemaker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Orange Order parade through Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens in . Pic PacemakerGareth CrossTwitterEmailJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPolice have confirmed they are investigating a band parade in north Belfast on Saturday evening that defied a Parades Commission ruling.The Parades Commission had ruled that the Kilcoole Community Band could not enter Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens as part of their Eleventh Night parade.However the band defied the ruling and marched through the area as planned.Belfast DUP councillor Dale Pankhurst criticised the limitations imposed by the Parades Commission and told the Belfastthat everything passed off peacefully on Saturday evening.In previous years Orange Order parades have been allowed to pass through the area. A PSNI spokesperson told the Belfastthat police are aware of a potentially unnotied parade in the Kilcoole Park area on Saturday.A number of those participating have been identied and we will seek to identy others, the spokesperson said. Enquiries are ongoing and any potential offences will be reported to the PPS for their consideration.A spokesperson for the Parades Commission said that it had received information that the parade took place on Saturday evening and that it was now a matter for the PSNI. The commission spokesperson explained that they had determined on July  that the parade could go ahead with a route restriction prohibiting the parade from entering any part of Kilcoole Park and Kilcoole Gardens. The commission determined that the parade may instead process a section of the Ballysillan Road, the spokesperson said.  “This decision reflected the community relations impacts of this parade in this area.The spokesperson said that the commission informed the PSNI in writing on Friday evening that it could not accept a sensitive parade notication at close of business.The parade was therefore un-notied to the commission. Un-notied parades are a matter for the PSNI, the spokesperson said.“Given the unique circumstances of this year’s Twelfth due to Covid-, the commission acknowledges the high level of responsibility demonstrated by the overwhelming number of parade organisers.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDUP councillor Dale Pankhurst Councillor Pankhurst said that he did not believe the parade broke any rules.He said that he understood a new application had been submitted after the commission waived the  day noticaiton ruling given the Covid- pandemic and the large number of late submissions due to the changing situation around the coronavirus regulations.The law allows for this as I understand it. Notication was given to both the PSNI and the Parades Commission. As this was a revised application and no determination issued on it, no law was broken and everyone had an enjoyable evening, the DUP councillor said. Councillor Pankhurst said despite the concerns of the Parades Commission the event passed off without incident. Their initial decision had the prospect to undo the many years of good work community workers have put in to building up relations in this part of north Belfast, he added.Despite their claims that community relations would be #damaged#, the exact opposite occurred. Everything passed off peacefully, just like I and parade organisers said it would.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Laois man and former Dublin U boss said it would be elitist and wouldnt do anything to improve hurling in the Ulster counties. “To be quite frank, no I am not in favour of it,” McEvoy told the County Derry Post, pointing to the rising tide in Ulster hurling. “Donegal are on top of Division A with Armagh. Derry and Down are on top of Division B. Antrim are on top of A.” McEvoy did admit that it was a Dublin Colleges amalgamation hurling team that started the ball rolling in Dublin. googletag.cmd.push “Youve got to start at the grass-roots,” McEvoy stated. “There is a massive amount of grass-roots work happening in Ulster.” He mentions the Celtic Challenge success for Derry, Antrim and Down. More can be done to promote hurling in Ulster, he feels, in terms of promoting national leagues from Division A down. McEvoy wants all league finals to be played in Croke Park and given the same recognition as football. “Theminor finals are in Croke Park, from the same traditional counties . “I am of the view that there should be a festival of hurling on All-Ireland weekend. The Joe McDonagh, Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard are played on a Saturday and on the Sunday, there is the All-Ireland . googletag.cmd.push “I personally think wedevelop the game we have, we have a good product and it will only benefit from what we are trying to do in the likes of Ulster.” A combined team may work at  or  years of age, but an Ulster senior team isnt a solution, the Derry manager added. “Where would it fit in the calendar  I think it is elitist. Is that going to improve hurling in Derry, or Donegal or Down  I dont think so.” McEvoy is in his second season as Derry boss and hasnt played in the Conor McGurk Cup or the Ulster championship in that time. He feels the players would want the championship back. “I can see the benefit of having an Ulster championship, as opposed to having a consolidated team from all the dferent counties, which is not going to benefit hurling in the dferent counties,” he said. “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” he added. Despite the poor weather in January and the players tied up in the Club All-Ireland, McEvoy also would see a benefit to it being played in pre-season. “I think that has merit, because it would give you more competitive games. In pre-season, you are looking for challenge matches and surely by having a provincial championship would give you that.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Magnicent Seven Crew is a project made up of singers and musicians from Derry, Dungiven and Sligo. They recently joined forces to help Foyle Foodbank with their role of providing food for those who are experiencing food poverty. The entertainment industry has been hit hard as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. With pubs closed, many singers and musicians lost their main source of income overnight. However, many local entertainment figures have been involved in fundraising initiatives during the lockdown. The Magnicent Seven Crew project was coordinated by local musician Leo Fitzpatrick who through his vision, enthusiasm, talent and commitment managed to achieve their target of pound, for the local foodbank. googletag.cmd.push The project saw up to  entertainers perform from home and encourage donations from those who tuned in nightly to see them. The Magnicent Seven Crew project went live on Facebook on Friday, May , and within eight weeks had achieved its target. Speaking on behalf of the Board Of Directors and volunteers at the Foyle Foodbank, Damien McAdams praised everyone involved in the recent fundraiser. “Night after night the entertainers give freely of their time and talent to produce a series of excellent performances,” he said. “Some of the performers it should be noted have lost their main source of income as a result of this pandemic and some are dealing with their own dficult health issues yet they have been determined in their willingness to help those most in need. googletag.cmd.push “The generosity of the Derry public and further afield has been amazing. “Its important to point out that all of the performers performed free of charge and all donations went to the Foyle Foodbank.” Mr McAdams added: “We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those singers, musicians and Leo Fitzpatrick for their magnicent achievement. “We also wish to acknowledge the great generosity of all those who donated in any way to the Foyle Foodbank.” The Foyle Foodbank says it has seen a sharp increase in demand for help during the lockdown period.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, they are able to see their sons become more independent and have more responsibility for their development, as they become full-time players.” Forbes was refereed to as a tough-tackling centre-half on the Hammers website after his recent arrival at the club. He came in on trial and got on really well with the lads. I think he could have a big future at the club hopefully he can attack pre-season training and show everyone what he’s all about. googletag.cmd.push Michael follows in the footsteps of fellow St Pius pupil Aaron Donnelly who signed for Nottingham Forest.

Like many others, the  year-old Derry driver has had to wait later than planned to get his season underway with events being rescheduled due to the Covid- pandemic. Rally di Roma Capitale in Italy will now open the series next week. Having shaken the establishment on his R debut at this level on Rally Hungary last year where he took a podium finish, Devine is determined to show that that resultwasn’t a once off. “We’re really looking forward to this event”, said Devine. “Obviously it’s been quite a wait to get out competitivelyagain so little things like getting a test in the car last week and unveiling the livery all add to the build up morethan usual. The car looks great and I’m extremely thankful to all our partners. googletag.cmd.push We showed inHungary last year some of what we are capable of but this will be a very dferent challenge with a very strong entry. With a curtailed championship too it means more than ever we’ll have to on it from the word go.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Junior Driverprograms has kept him busy over the last number of months as the start of the season was delayed. “Being involved in those initiatives has been a great help at keeping focused over the last while andwill hopefully stand to me when we cross the start line”, Callum said. “At this level it can be thosesmall things that make the dference. Hyundai have also carried out a lot of development on the iR too and that will be great, not just for me, but for the competitiveness of the championship.” googletag.cmd.push Callum as usual, will be partnered by Brian Hoy and the Hyundai will be run by Irish rally preparation firm, PCRS. The all Irish team will also be entered officially under the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy banner making them eligible to score points in the ERC Teams Championship too. However,it’s another championship that Callum is eyeing up. “The ERC Junior Championship is undoubtedlyour focus this season because of the prize fund on offer, there aren’t many prizes like that in rallying.” Rally di Roma Capitale will begin on Friday, July  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just under km which and the event is operating a very strict Covid- policy, with restrictions on spectators as well as all registered personnel.

Having shaken the establishment on his R debut at this level on Rally Hungary last year where he took a podium finish, Devine is determined to show that that resultwasn’t a once off. “We’re really looking forward to this event”, said Devine. “Obviously it’s been quite a wait to get out competitivelyagain so little things like getting a test in the car last week and unveiling the livery all add to the build up morethan usual. The car looks great and I’m extremely thankful to all our partners. googletag.cmd.push We showed inHungary last year some of what we are capable of but this will be a very dferent challenge with a very strong entry. With a curtailed championship too it means more than ever we’ll have to on it from the word go.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Junior Driverprograms has kept him busy over the last number of months as the start of the season was delayed. “Being involved in those initiatives has been a great help at keeping focused over the last while andwill hopefully stand to me when we cross the start line”, Callum said. “At this level it can be thosesmall things that make the dference. Hyundai have also carried out a lot of development on the iR too and that will be great, not just for me, but for the competitiveness of the championship.” googletag.cmd.push Callum as usual, will be partnered by Brian Hoy and the Hyundai will be run by Irish rally preparation firm, PCRS. The all Irish team will also be entered officially under the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy banner making them eligible to score points in the ERC Teams Championship too. However,it’s another championship that Callum is eyeing up. “The ERC Junior Championship is undoubtedlyour focus this season because of the prize fund on offer, there aren’t many prizes like that in rallying.” Rally di Roma Capitale will begin on Friday, July  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just under km which and the event is operating a very strict Covid- policy, with restrictions on spectators as well as all registered personnel.

That acted as the trigger.ldquoWhen my mother died a few years later, I brought my father over to live with us and he has since settled in well.ldquoWe are surrounded by horses, hens, dogs, cats, lizards and a few snakes. Maybe not you average farm animals, but we do have stunning views of rolling drumlins, forests and two beautul lakes.ldquoI feel there is an inspirational current with the weather in this part of Co Down.

I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year. A short story I wrote called The Armada Tree,won Kraxon Magazinersquos Story of the Year Award.ldquoI am lucky enough to belong to some brilliant writing groups, not least the Hexmen, the Yellow Door Group, and the Belfast Writers Group.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger. My appeal to all drivers is to obey the restrictions in place and drive below the permitted level in built-up areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Customers and owners delighted pubs re open  ","story":"PUBLICANS across the district have reported a positiveto opening their doors for the first time since the Covid- lockdown.Bars and restaurants were permitted to open for business last Friday by the Stormont Executive under strict conditions.Customers were only allowed indoors provided they were dining and and non-diners who permitted to drink outside, both socially distanced to m between people.After nearly four months of closure, the reopening was welcomed by publicans and customers alike.Despite being hampered by heavy rain throughout the weekend, publicans reported a generally positive reception by customers experiencing the lsquonew normalrsquo way of socialising.However, several publicans claimed that full compliance to all the drinking regulations was patchy in some towns throughout the district.Stephen Magorrian, owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, said while numbers of drinkers and diners were less than normal over the weekend, his customers appreciated the social distancing precautions and measures his team had put in place.ldquoWhile it was probably quieter than I would have liked inside for dining, it was very well received by all our customers who were appreciative of how we had trained our staff and the measures we had in place, said Mr Magorrian.ldquoWe had a lot of very positive comments from customers as they left which we are taking as a good sign.ldquoLast weekend was really about making people feel safe in the hope that they will feel safe for customers and staff and be happy toand word will spread that we are taking their safety seriously.He added that while his team had planned how to cope with larger than expected turnout of customers by hiring a door supervisor, ldquosome other bars really went for it, like it was St Patrickrsquos Day.ldquoWe had no issues with any of our customers who were drinking outside and we were happy to welcome them back.Jack OrsquoHare, owner of OrsquoHarersquos in Newcastle, said he had enjoyed a ldquobusy weekend.ldquoCustomers were delighted to be back and so were our staff.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way. It was an experience I wouldnrsquot have missed.We have  fully booked for July . Thank God!

But outbreaks around the world, particularly in America, show that it could easily , and wreak havoc.While it was deplorable that  people were seen at one Belfast location, clearly ignoring social distancing, in the same way that some of the bonfire breaches on Saturday night were deplorable, it is important to emphasise the scale of what was achieved.Normally a July  brings hundreds of thousands of people out to take part or to watch. The disgraceful calculated social distancing breach at the Bobby Storey funeral, with Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister not only at the helm of it, but truculent and unapologetic since, despite having drawn up strict guidelines that stopped other people mourning, could have caused people to rebel in large numbers on the Twelfth. That would have been understandable, but quite wrong.And it didn’t happen. Instead, across Northern Ireland, people watched from their gardens or footpaths, as the loyal orders and politicians had urged them to, in an inventive and safe response to this year’s unique festivities.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

over the last few months, the number of people contracting coronavirus each day in Wales is falling, so too is the risk of meeting somebody with virus.ldquoGiven the progress we have made, we are able to take some additional cautious steps to further unlock our society and economy.ldquoThis includes more retailers being able re-open their businesses, as long as they take measures to minimise the risk to their staff and to the customers who visit their stores.ldquoOur focus continues to be on the health risks of the outbreak, but we can now begin to cautiously focus much more squarely on the wider economic and societal impact the virus is having.ldquoWe have provided a huge amount of support to businesses and jobs as they hibernated during the pandemic ndash now we start to take these careful steps to restart our economy.On Monday, a series of changes will be made to the coronavirus regulations ndash the main change will be to enable non-essential retail businesses to open.They

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afefeadedadcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfeddacbacbacf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.

In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: * Pre-Booking of tickets – to control the number of patrons in foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. * In-Cinema Seat Separation – the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others * Limited capacity – they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer and screen capacities will reduce by over % * Enhanced cleaning regimes – including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”. Excited cinema-goers will be able to book tickets online at Omniplex.ie  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbafeebece   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bacbbdcbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
