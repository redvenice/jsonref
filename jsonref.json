Aziz Ansari was spotted getting cozy with a mystery woman at the US Open on Sunday           DailyMail.com can reveal the woman is 29-year-old Serena Campbell, from Denmark, and is currently studying for a PhD at London\u0027s King\u0027s College          Campbell shared an article last year titled \u0027Literally, Why Can\u0027t I Say #MeToo?\u0027 in which the author says she struggles to identify as a victim despite her experiences\u0027Yes, it is my daughter, but I don\u0027t want to say any more,\u0027 she said.Campbell is a researcher studying for her PhD at London\u0027s King\u0027s College, one of the world\u0027s top-ranked universities. She is specializing in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields.And Campbell is also a mentor to a British project to launch a satellite which will seek to find out the weather patterns on planets outside the solar system using the ultra-violet light spectrum, part of her expertise.Last year she she told her Facebook friends she was traveling from London to South Korea in July last year for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field.A day later, friends told her how proud they were when she posted pictures from the event, with one commenting: \u0027Proud of how far you have traveled in your life. Well done.\u0027 Another called her a \u0027superstar\u0027, saying: \u0027Looks like an amazing event and we\u0027ll (sic) done on all your years of learning to get you there.\u0027Ansari, 35, did not appear intimidated by her academic achievements as the pair were pictured smiling and laughing, with the Master of None star whispering in her ear and waving at the crowd at the U.S Open last Monday – indicating he appears to be moving on from controversial sexual misconduct allegations earlier this year.    Scientist Serena Skov Campbell is a researcher pursuing a PhD in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields          Campbell traveled from London to South Korea in July 2017 for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field, according to her Facebook           Campbell has an impressive academic resume, according to her research page, which details her work in plasmonicsThe physicist also seems to be unfazed by the allegations leveled against her new beau and was seen holding hands with him in New York City in early August.Campbell often shares pieces of her academic work on her Facebook page, and ironically, she once shared an article questioning the the MeToo movement, a few months before Ansari was  himself accused of sexual misconduct.In October 2017, she shared an article titled, \u0027Literally, Why Can\u0027t I Say #MeToo?\u0027 by Total Sorority Move, in which the female author says she struggles to identify as a victim because she feels her own experiences with sexual misconduct, are not \u0027bad enough.\u0027 In January, Ansari was accused of sexual misconduct when an anonymous 23-year-old woman from Brooklyn claimed he ignored her verbal and non-verbal cues and repeatedly tried to pressure her into having sex with him after they went on a date last September. The accusations were made in a story on Babe.net, where the woman, under the pseudonym \u0027Grace\u0027 alleged that she had felt \u0027violated\u0027 by the comic\u0027s overly-aggressive gestures.Meryl Streep leads a host of A-list celebrities including...The spectacular fall of Les Moonves: The chilling claims of...Share this article    The pair were spotted canoodling as they watch the tennis match.

Britannia would be a place for fun, for mischief and — in a world governed by ritual and tradition — for the spur-of-the-moment.Diplomat Sir Roger du Boulay and his wife joined the Yacht for a week in 1974 during his years as Resident Commissioner of the New Hebrides. They were astounded one night when dinner was followed by the ship’s entertainment — ‘an elaborate pantomime’ — in front of the Royal Family and the crew, with the Queen acting as wardrobe assistant.‘It involved the equerry taking the part of a Polynesian beauty,’ says du Boulay. ‘I remember him sitting on the floor and I remember seeing the Queen kneeling on the floor. He was stripped to the waist and she was fitting a brassiere on to him. It was an extraordinary sight!’ABOARD, informality would go a long way — but it had its limits. John Gorton, former Prime Minister of Australia, later recalled one beach barbecue with the family during a 1970 tour of Australia, when the royal party decided it was time for a swim.‘Princess Anne was thrown in and then Prince Philip,’ he said. ‘I was sitting next to Her Majesty and I was just about to throw her in but I looked at her and something about the way she looked at me told me that perhaps I shouldn’t.

Shortly before the 1997 election, the Conservative government announced that it would build a new yacht with a budget of £60 million.But it had failed to follow a political golden rule, that major undertakings involving the Crown require cross-party agreement.Tony Blair’s New Labour was not consulted and duly opposed the idea, which thus became an election issue. Not surprisingly, on being elected a few months later, the Labour government declined to commission a new yacht.Blair would later admit to me that it had been a mistake to get rid of Britannia in the first place and that he would have retained it, if he had been elected sooner.The Royal Family determinedly avoided becoming involved in what was clearly a political matter and thus strictly off-limits. Hence the brevity of the mournful speech by the Prince of Wales to the ship’s company on the night of Britannia’s retirement, the shortest after-dinner address of his life.‘I just want to get blindly, madly drunk,’ he declared and sat down again, to thunderous applause. His audience knew exactly how he felt.Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman, (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.To order a copy for £20 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/10/06/4FF542BA00000578-6150017-Anna_Wintour_checking_out_Sunday_s_game_at_the_Arthur_Ashe_Stadi-a-134_1536557436606.jpg","title":"Meryl Streep Anna Wintour celebs watch Novak Djokovic wins 14th Grand Slam","story":"    Anna Wintour checking out Sunday\u0027s game at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, New York          Model Christie Brinkley was also at the game with her son Jack and his girlfriend Nina Agdal          At one point during the match, Brinkley\u0027s son Jack shared a kiss with Agdal          Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend were among the celebs at the match.

Roberts said he’s telling them to get out of town.\u0027I’m telling them to go inland, but I’m worried about the rain and tornadoes too,\u0027 Roberts said.Several meteorologists said Florence could do what Hurricane Harvey did last year over Texas, dumping days of rain, although not quite as bad.\u0027I think this is very Harvey-esque,\u0027 said University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy.           \u0027Normally, a landfalling tropical cyclone just keeps on going inland, gradually dissipating and raining itself out. But on rare occasions, the steering patterns can line up such that a storm slips into a dead zone between troughs and ridges.\u0027On North Carolina’s Outer Banks, Dawn Farrow Taylor, 50, was gathering photos and important documents and filling prescriptions Monday before heading inland. She grew up on the island chain, and says this will be only the second time she’s evacuated.\u0027I don’t think many of us have ever been through a Category 4. And out here we’re so fragile. We’re just a strip of land - we’re a barrier island,\u0027 she said.In the village of Buxton, Liz Browning Fox plans to ride the storm out in her house on top of a ridge. She believes her home, built in 2009, will be secure, but it’s hard to foresee all potential hazards.\u0027You never know, there could be tree missiles coming from any direction,\u0027 she said. \u0027There is no way to be completely safe.\u0027           An evacuation order from Virginia Gov.

Roy Cooper said his state was \u0027in the bullseye\u0027 of the storm and urged people to \u0027get ready now.\u0027Cooper is urging residents to evacuate the state\u0027s coastal areas as Hurricane Florence moves closer to landfall.Cooper\u0027s office said in a statement Monday that the Category 4 hurricane is expected to hit the Wilmington area on Thursday, but impacts of the storm will likely begin Wednesday. Cooper says the state faces three threats from Florence: \u0027ocean surge along our coast, strong winds, and inland flooding from heavy rain.\u0027Counties that have ordered evacuations are Bertie, Brunswick, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, New Hanover and Onslow.The statement says more evacuation orders are expected on Tuesday.Residents are also urged to download the Ready NC app or follow NC Emergency Management on Facebook and Twitter for weather updates and to learn how to prepare for the storm.North Carolina also ordered an evacuation of some 250,000 residents on the Outer Banks and parts of coastal Dare County, while a state of emergency was declared in both Virginia and Maryland.Florence has winds of 130 miles per hour and is due to gain strength before making landfall early Thursday, bringing heavy rain that could cause severe flooding through the region.\u0027Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,\u0027 the National Hurricane Center said. South Carolina\u0027s emergency management agency said it was already \u0027preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster\u0027.          Rapidly intensifying Hurricane Florence (bottom right) could strike a direct and dangerous blow anywhere from the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic region later this weekSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued the evacuation order on Monday for all eight counties along the coast, including: Jasper, Beaufort, Colleton, Charleston, Dorchester, Georgetown, Horry, and Berkeley.\u0027This is a very dangerous hurricane,\u0027 McMaster said, adding that the evacuation order for coastal counties was \u0027mandatory, not voluntary.\u0027 \u0027We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.\u0027He said storm surge could reach as high as 10 feet and estimated that one million residents would be leaving the coast. Eastbound lanes of Interstate 26 heading into Charleston and U.S. 501 heading into Myrtle Beach will be reversed when the order takes effect.McMaster, as well as the governors of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, have already declared states of emergency.\u0027Now is the time for your family also to prepare and stay tuned for more updates,\u0027  McMaster said earlier. \u0027Plan for the worst, pray for the best.\u0027 Forecasters say the hurricane\u0027s strength is expected to fluctuate but it still will be a dangerous storm by the time it reaches the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday. For many people, the challenge could be finding a safe refuge: If Florence slows to a crawl just off the coast, it could bring torrential rains to the Appalachian mountains and as far away as West Virginia, causing flash floods, mudslides and other dangerous conditions. The storm\u0027s potential path also includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous eastern hog farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons. National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned that Florence was forecast to linger over the Carolinas once it reaches shore. He said people living well inland should prepare to lose power and endure flooding and other hazards.    It\u0027s too early to know the exact path, but forecasters said Florence could blow ashore in the Carolinas by Thursday          Chris Rayner helps customers load their cars as they bought supplies at a Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina in preparation for Hurricane Florence          People shop at the Harris Teeter, filling up on water and supplies, in Charleston, South Carolina as Hurricane Florence becomes a threatHeavy rain in the Washington area over the weekend had already led to flooding in historic Alexandria, Virginia and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for part of the Potomac River.           North Carolina officials on Monday ordered mandatory evacuations for the state\u0027s Outer Banks barrier islandsOne person drowned on Sunday and two others were injured in dangerous surf conditions off Daytona Beach in Florida churned by Hurricane Florence. Up and down the densely populated coast, residents have been told to prepare, and not just for a possible direct blow. Florence could slow or stall on or near shore, scooping up massive amounts of seawater. Some forecasting models show it could unload a foot or two of rain in places, causing devastating inland flooding. Forecasters also warned of a rising threat of life-threatening storm surge, along with the damaging winds.  Navy ships off Virginia\u0027s coast were preparing to sail out of the path, a North Carolina university has already canceled classes and people have begun stocking up on plywood, bottled water and other supplies.Red flags have already been flying on beaches, warning swimmers to stay out of the water as seas began kicking up.

As well as being a masterpiece it provides historians insight into everday life in 1600s London          The 7ft image was engraved onto four tiles which then made a panorama. This 1625 picture looked out from the South Bank to show life in London at the time. The engraving only has two copies, one of which sold for more than £100,000 at an auction in London today. The other copy is stored in Washington          The Tower of London never had onion style domes and The Globe theatre did not look like what is depicted. The reason for these errors  is because Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher never visited London in his life, yet still managed to engrave the masterpieceOn the River Thames, which has only one bridge ning it, there is a Royal procession of boats taking King Charles I westwards.The spire of the famous Bow church is depicted as is Somerset House on the banks if the river.On the hills beyond what is now the city of London, Horowe-on-the-Hill (Harrow) is marked as is the idyllic looking Stepney villa.And Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills.Remarkably, the panorama\u0027s creator, the Dutch engraver and cartographer Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London, so the work required some imagination.Some say he copied exisiting sketches, or perhaps he used maps, explaining why the locations are accurate but the buildings are wrong.           The Visscher panorama gives insight into Tower Bridge. The southern gatehouse (above) shows the heads of traitors on a pike, used as a warning to ordinary Londoners, which proved effective. The houses on the bridge burned down just 10 years later, in a small fire in 1633. They would be meekly re-built, leading to the spread of the fire in 1666          The Bear Garden, left, was used for bear-baiting and popular animal sports and was called the Paris garden by ordinary Londoners. The Visscher panorama (above) is one of the earliest pictures of what the arena looked like, with Londoners trying to sneak a peek inside (left bottom). Also showing to the right is the Globe Theatre, famous for the play performances of William Shakespeare. Again, Londoners look on outside the walls (centre bottom) As a result, the Tower of London boasts some imaginative onion-styled domes.This 1625 panorama is one of only two known copies to exist, with the other one residing in the Folger Library in Washington DC, US.It is likely to have been made for a Dutch merchant as there was a burgeoning trade between London and Amsterdam at the beginning of the 17th century.The panorama was consigned for sale with auctioneers Christie\u0027s by a European private collector and the creases indicate it had been folded over and tucked away throughout its existence.Do you have a plague pit under your street?

The River Thames was awash with boats and trade back and forth, mainly to the Dutch port of Amsterdam. This was a time of progress, but Londoners were also worried about the threat of piracy. Unbelievably, a group called the Barbary Pirates from North Africa invaded a small part of Cornwall. Shocked and unprepared, around 60 locals were enslaved in Mount\u0027s Bay, Cornwall          The above picture shows Bow Church aqnd below it the River Thames. Before the fire, London was thriving but when this picture was depicted, there was political strife. King Charles I would marry Henrietta Maria that year, the daughter of Henry IV of France in Canterbury, Kent. The royal wedding was not popular with Londoners, since Maria was a Catholic          Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills. The panorama\u0027s artist, Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London. But how did he do it? Some claim he used maps of London, and this is how he got things in the right place but inaccurate depictions. Others claim he used earlier sketches and copied those. But that mystery adds value to the engraving, which sold for more than £100,000\u0027There are earlier views of London but not on this impressive scale and the quality of the engraving is fantastic.\u0027It is fascinating to get this view of London from before the great fire when St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and Tower Bridge were destroyed.\u0027Also, there is a wonderful humanity to the panorama with people peering through the theatre windows in the foreground and the large ships on the Thames, giving a great insight into the way of life at that time.\u0027          The engraving is likely to have been made for a Dutch merchant as there was a burgeoning trade between London and Amsterdam at the beginning of the 17th century          A wide distance shot shows modern day Harrow.

Erick Vanselow, left, and Elizabeth Wilkins, right, who are accused of assaulting their child and causing GBH, showed calmness that was \u0027not normal\u0027 when taking him to hospital, a court heardPlymouth Crown Court heard how Vanselow told a consultant paediatrician he had accidentally dropped the infant on to a plastic kitchen counter early that morning.But the Crown Prosecution Service, opening the case, said that neither the head injuries, nor the rib fractures could have been caused accidentally.Jo Martin, QC, said that the child was assaulted by either  or both parents on several occasions two years ago at the former couple\u0027s home in Plymouth, Devon.Vanselow, now 30, was then studying for a masters in international relations at the University of Plymouth. Wilkins, 23, was also about to start the final year of a law degree at the university.They have both been named after a judge lifted a court order.Hunt for Madeleine McCann could be shelved within THREE...Judge blasts messenger app Kik for failing to release...Share this articleThe court has heard the boy was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, 17 days before his admission, with bloodshot eyes.An expert has already told the court those injuries were mostly likely caused by the chest being crushed.Sister Sophie Brock, nurse in charge of the section of the A\u0026ampE department which admitted the boy, said the Wilkins was \u0027very calm\u0027 when the ambulance arrived at about 4.30pm.She added that staff struggled to find a vein to insert an intravenous drip into the child and so had to drill into the bone marrow.Mrs Brock described the procedure as \u0027distressing to watch\u0027.She added that it was not fair for a parent to stay and so Wilkins was asked to step outside.Mrs Brock said: \u0027Her reply was that she watched Holby and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE, which was a little bit of a strange thing to say.\u0027Piers Norsworthy, for Wilkins, asked the witness: \u0027When you are presented with a very sick baby, one imagines the worst thing you could see is a panicky, distracting mother?\u0027Mrs Brock replied: \u0027It does not help but it is normal and we are able to deal with that.\u0027Derriford consultant paediatrician Thynn Aung said that she spoke to the parents together to get a history of what had happened that day.She said that Vanselow told her he had dropped the baby so the infant had hit the left side of his head against a plastic kitchen counter during a feed at 4am that morning.An ambulance paramedic had earlier told the court that the father had said he dropped the boy about a foot.The court has also heard that Vanselow called a GP just after 2pm to say he was worried about meningitis - but did not immediately mention the accident.The jury has heard conflicting evidence about when Wilkins heard about the incident.Dr Aung said that there were inconsistencies in Vanselow\u0027s story, including mention of the baby hitting the left side of the head - when his major injuries were on the right side.She added that she was concerned about what she called the \u0027inappropriate delay\u0027 in the parents seeking medical help.          Vanselow, pictured, has \u0027inconsistencies\u0027 in his version of events, according to a doctor, including what side of his son\u0027s head was injuredDr Aung added: \u0027I was concerned about the lack of obvious emotional response by the parents during the interview.\u0027The boy cannot be named nor any photograph used by court order.Vanselow and Wilkins have each denied inidual counts of assaulting the baby with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on September 22, 2016.They have also pleaded not guilty to alternative counts of assaulting him causing grievous bodily harm without intent. These charges relate to the head injuries.The parents have also denied causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm to a child between his birth on July 2 and September 23 that year.Wilkins alone has pleaded not guilty to assaulting the baby causing actual bodily harm between August 31 and September 3.

Since the crash in 1996, Mr Reed\u0027s healing process has left him with thin, patchy hair  The one-day, six hour process involved around 3,000 hair follicles being removed from the thick-growing back of his head and transplanted into the required areas\u0027Undergoing a hair transplant is expensive but as far as I\u0027m concerned it was worth every penny.\u0027The crash occurred when Mr Reed was just 21, and enjoying a night out with friends. He had decided not to drink and instead drove out to a pub in Pontefract, West Yorks in his Peugeot 306. Mr Reed was driving home when his vehicle struck a patch a black ice, resulting in him losing control and flipping the car over.As the Peugeot careered towards a halt, Mr Reed\u0027s head touched the road removing around half his scalp. Firefighters took two hours to cut him free, and Ant was then rushed to hospital in Wakefield. Surgeons set to work to repair what he describes as a \u0027wedge shape\u0027 chunk in the middle of his head around the hairline.Silicone implants had to be placed in the front, top and back of his head and a saline solution was then pumped into a tube to bring Mr Reed\u0027s head back to a normal shape.          Although Mr Reed miraculously survived the impact he claims he was left looking like the \u0027Elephant Man\u0027 and his scalp had to be pieced back together using a graft from his legMr Reed added: \u0027I remember setting out in my car and then nothing until I woke up in hospital the next day. My car had landed on its roof and the doctors knew from my injuries that my head had come into contact with the road.\u0027I had no brain injuries and I felt lucky to be alive, but I\u0027d been left with quite serious damage to the front and top of my head. An area in the middle just below where the hairline starts had suffered and I was told my scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself.\u0027My car was a total write-off but that didn\u0027t seem too important in the context of lying injured in hospital. I was young at the time and you really don\u0027t want issues with your hair, but that was what I was faced with.\u0027My scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself and so the medics took a skin graft from one of my legs and put that onto my head. They then cut some skin from the side of my head and put this around to the front of my forehead because there was nothing there that could be saved either. I put myself in their hands but I knew there would be more surgery to follow.\u0027          Mr Reed said: \u0027I\u0027m very happy with the procedure and though I\u0027m a little thinner than I was in my younger days, my hair is substantially better than it was before I had the transplant\u0027\u0027The saline process was very painful, it was like having your head set on fire. The implants worked, although one silicone bag split through the skin and even today my right eyebrow is at a slight angle due to not being stretched sufficiently.\u0027The accident also left me with whiplash, from which I suffered for next eight months. Overall, I felt I looked like the Elephant Man when the silicone implants were at their biggest.\u0027  Mr Reed with his wife and children after the transplant, which he is \u0027very happy\u0027 with\u0027When I was 21, no-one had heard about hair transplants and if they had, then it was only mentioned in a jokey kind of way.\u0027It was definitely not something to be taken seriously, especially for a man, it wasn\u0027t really something they were expected to consider.\u0027But I\u0027d receded to the point where there was about an inch in the centre of my forehead that stood out, it was like a little strip right in the middle. I also had some scars at the side of my head, although they weren\u0027t as much of an issue.\u0027I thought about what could be done and so decided to look into my options quite seriously. Cheaper options were available but I knew which one came with the likelihood of the best results and I was happy to go with that.\u0027Dr Farjo said: \u0027People come to us for all kinds for reasons, but Ant\u0027s story was a little different to those we normally hear. When someone begins to lose their hair, it can have quite serious implications on their mental wellbeing.\u0027And in Ant\u0027s case, his situation was complicated further by the fact that the skin grafts he\u0027d received following the crash had also impacted on his natural hairline.\u0027We\u0027re delighted that Ant has had a positive reaction to the surgery and we\u0027d urge anyone in a similar position following head trauma to seek professional help.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/12/5006BBDB00000578-6154899-image-m-13_1536665573701.jpg","title":"Paramedics Spalding Lincolnshire left note ambulance 5 note coffee","story":"    A mystery neighbour posted this note on an East Midlands ambulance when it parked on their drive to help save a patient on Sunday           The ambulance service was so touched they posted a picture of the note on their Twitter Fury as traffic wardens slap £130 parking tickets on...Mother accused of seriously injuring her baby ¿told nurse...Share this articleThe East Midlands Ambulance Service tweeted a picture of the note with the caption: \u0027Lincolnshire Paramedic Julie Wade \u0026amp ECA Catherine Whitehouse were attending a patient in Spalding yesterday when they had a #bluelighthappy moment. \u0027When they left to take the patient to the ambulance they were greeted with this #EMAZING note.\u0027          Pictured: Catherine Whitehouse of the East Midlands Ambulance Service was one of the medics who was given £5 by the mystery neighbour The crew admitted they didn\u0027t have time to buy a coffee as they were rushing the patient to hospital but would make up for it later in the day.This isn\u0027t the first time ambulance crews have found a thank you note for them.One of the Tongham Ambulance Crews for South East Coast Ambulance Service found a note on their ambulance while attending to a patient on a 999 call in Camberley in the early hours of August 27.The note read: \u0027Just wanted to say a massive thank you for being out at all hours of the day and night and being true heroes.\u0027I can\u0027t begin to imagine how hard your job must be so have some breakfast on me!

Roberts said he’s telling them to get out of town.\u0027I’m telling them to go inland, but I’m worried about the rain and tornadoes too,\u0027 Roberts said.Several meteorologists said Florence could do what Hurricane Harvey did last year over Texas, dumping days of rain, although not quite as bad.\u0027I think this is very Harvey-esque,\u0027 said University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy.           \u0027Normally, a landfalling tropical cyclone just keeps on going inland, gradually dissipating and raining itself out. But on rare occasions, the steering patterns can line up such that a storm slips into a dead zone between troughs and ridges.\u0027On North Carolina’s Outer Banks, Dawn Farrow Taylor, 50, was gathering photos and important documents and filling prescriptions Monday before heading inland. She grew up on the island chain, and says this will be only the second time she’s evacuated.\u0027I don’t think many of us have ever been through a Category 4. And out here we’re so fragile. We’re just a strip of land - we’re a barrier island,\u0027 she said.In the village of Buxton, Liz Browning Fox plans to ride the storm out in her house on top of a ridge. She believes her home, built in 2009, will be secure, but it’s hard to foresee all potential hazards.\u0027You never know, there could be tree missiles coming from any direction,\u0027 she said. \u0027There is no way to be completely safe.\u0027           An evacuation order from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam applies to about 245,000 people, including parts of the Hampton Roads area and Eastern Shore.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said his state was \u0027in the bullseye\u0027 of the storm and urged people to \u0027get ready now.\u0027Cooper is urging residents to evacuate the state\u0027s coastal areas as Hurricane Florence moves closer to landfall.Cooper\u0027s office said in a statement Monday that the Category 4 hurricane is expected to hit the Wilmington area on Thursday, but impacts of the storm will likely begin Wednesday. Cooper says the state faces three threats from Florence: \u0027ocean surge along our coast, strong winds, and inland flooding from heavy rain.\u0027Counties that have ordered evacuations are Bertie, Brunswick, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, New Hanover and Onslow.The statement says more evacuation orders are expected on Tuesday.Residents are also urged to download the Ready NC app or follow NC Emergency Management on Facebook and Twitter for weather updates and to learn how to prepare for the storm.North Carolina also ordered an evacuation of some 250,000 residents on the Outer Banks and parts of coastal Dare County, while a state of emergency was declared in both Virginia and Maryland.Florence has winds of 130 miles per hour and is due to gain strength before making landfall early Thursday, bringing heavy rain that could cause severe flooding through the region.\u0027Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,\u0027 the National Hurricane Center said. South Carolina\u0027s emergency management agency said it was already \u0027preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster\u0027.          Rapidly intensifying Hurricane Florence (bottom right) could strike a direct and dangerous blow anywhere from the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic region later this weekSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued the evacuation order on Monday for all eight counties along the coast, including: Jasper, Beaufort, Colleton, Charleston, Dorchester, Georgetown, Horry, and Berkeley.\u0027This is a very dangerous hurricane,\u0027 McMaster said, adding that the evacuation order for coastal counties was \u0027mandatory, not voluntary.\u0027 \u0027We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.\u0027He said storm surge could reach as high as 10 feet and estimated that one million residents would be leaving the coast. Eastbound lanes of Interstate 26 heading into Charleston and U.S. 501 heading into Myrtle Beach will be reversed when the order takes effect.McMaster, as well as the governors of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, have already declared states of emergency.\u0027Now is the time for your family also to prepare and stay tuned for more updates,\u0027  McMaster said earlier. \u0027Plan for the worst, pray for the best.\u0027 Forecasters say the hurricane\u0027s strength is expected to fluctuate but it still will be a dangerous storm by the time it reaches the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday. For many people, the challenge could be finding a safe refuge: If Florence slows to a crawl just off the coast, it could bring torrential rains to the Appalachian mountains and as far away as West Virginia, causing flash floods, mudslides and other dangerous conditions. The storm\u0027s potential path also includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous eastern hog farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons. National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned that Florence was forecast to linger over the Carolinas once it reaches shore.

Florence could slow or stall on or near shore, scooping up massive amounts of seawater. Some forecasting models show it could unload a foot or two of rain in places, causing devastating inland flooding. Forecasters also warned of a rising threat of life-threatening storm surge, along with the damaging winds.  Navy ships off Virginia\u0027s coast were preparing to sail out of the path, a North Carolina university has already canceled classes and people have begun stocking up on plywood, bottled water and other supplies.Red flags have already been flying on beaches, warning swimmers to stay out of the water as seas began kicking up. People rushed to get emergency kits ready, map out escape routes, fill sandbags and secure their homes.In coastal Charleston, South Carolina, city officials offered sandbags to residents. Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune urged people to secure their homes but said it was too early to know if evacuations will be ordered.Myrtle Beach hardware stores and supermarkets were busy ringing up sales of bottled water, plywood and generators.\u0027Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,\u0027 Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News. \u0027They\u0027re coming in and buying water and plates, and that\u0027s about all they\u0027re buying.\u0027North Carolina crews were getting bulldozers and chain saws ready.

As well as being a masterpiece it provides historians insight into everday life in 1600s London          The 7ft image was engraved onto four tiles which then made a panorama. This 1625 picture looked out from the South Bank to show life in London at the time. The engraving only has two copies, one of which sold for more than £100,000 at an auction in London today. The other copy is stored in Washington          The Tower of London never had onion style domes and The Globe theatre did not look like what is depicted. The reason for these errors  is because Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher never visited London in his life, yet still managed to engrave the masterpieceOn the River Thames, which has only one bridge ning it, there is a Royal procession of boats taking King Charles I westwards.The spire of the famous Bow church is depicted as is Somerset House on the banks if the river.On the hills beyond what is now the city of London, Horowe-on-the-Hill (Harrow) is marked as is the idyllic looking Stepney villa.And Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills.Remarkably, the panorama\u0027s creator, the Dutch engraver and cartographer Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London, so the work required some imagination.Some say he copied exisiting sketches, or perhaps he used maps, explaining why the locations are accurate but the buildings are wrong.           The Visscher panorama gives insight into Tower Bridge. The southern gatehouse (above) shows the heads of traitors on a pike, used as a warning to ordinary Londoners, which proved effective. The houses on the bridge burned down just 10 years later, in a small fire in 1633. They would be meekly re-built, leading to the spread of the fire in 1666          The Bear Garden, left, was used for bear-baiting and popular animal sports and was called the Paris garden by ordinary Londoners.

The River Thames was awash with boats and trade back and forth, mainly to the Dutch port of Amsterdam. This was a time of progress, but Londoners were also worried about the threat of piracy. Unbelievably, a group called the Barbary Pirates from North Africa invaded a small part of Cornwall. Shocked and unprepared, around 60 locals were enslaved in Mount\u0027s Bay, Cornwall          The above picture shows Bow Church aqnd below it the River Thames. Before the fire, London was thriving but when this picture was depicted, there was political strife. King Charles I would marry Henrietta Maria that year, the daughter of Henry IV of France in Canterbury, Kent. The royal wedding was not popular with Londoners, since Maria was a Catholic          Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills. The panorama\u0027s artist, Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London. But how did he do it? Some claim he used maps of London, and this is how he got things in the right place but inaccurate depictions. Others claim he used earlier sketches and copied those. But that mystery adds value to the engraving, which sold for more than £100,000\u0027There are earlier views of London but not on this impressive scale and the quality of the engraving is fantastic.\u0027It is fascinating to get this view of London from before the great fire when St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and Tower Bridge were destroyed.\u0027Also, there is a wonderful humanity to the panorama with people peering through the theatre windows in the foreground and the large ships on the Thames, giving a great insight into the way of life at that time.\u0027          The engraving is likely to have been made for a Dutch merchant as there was a burgeoning trade between London and Amsterdam at the beginning of the 17th century          A wide distance shot shows modern day Harrow.

Since the crash in 1996, Mr Reed\u0027s healing process has left him with thin, patchy hair  The one-day, six hour process involved around 3,000 hair follicles being removed from the thick-growing back of his head and transplanted into the required areas\u0027Undergoing a hair transplant is expensive but as far as I\u0027m concerned it was worth every penny.\u0027The crash occurred when Mr Reed was just 21, and enjoying a night out with friends. He had decided not to drink and instead drove out to a pub in Pontefract, West Yorks in his Peugeot 306. Mr Reed was driving home when his vehicle struck a patch a black ice, resulting in him losing control and flipping the car over.As the Peugeot careered towards a halt, Mr Reed\u0027s head touched the road removing around half his scalp. Firefighters took two hours to cut him free, and Ant was then rushed to hospital in Wakefield. Surgeons set to work to repair what he describes as a \u0027wedge shape\u0027 chunk in the middle of his head around the hairline.Silicone implants had to be placed in the front, top and back of his head and a saline solution was then pumped into a tube to bring Mr Reed\u0027s head back to a normal shape.          Although Mr Reed miraculously survived the impact he claims he was left looking like the \u0027Elephant Man\u0027 and his scalp had to be pieced back together using a graft from his legMr Reed added: \u0027I remember setting out in my car and then nothing until I woke up in hospital the next day. My car had landed on its roof and the doctors knew from my injuries that my head had come into contact with the road.\u0027I had no brain injuries and I felt lucky to be alive, but I\u0027d been left with quite serious damage to the front and top of my head. An area in the middle just below where the hairline starts had suffered and I was told my scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself.\u0027My car was a total write-off but that didn\u0027t seem too important in the context of lying injured in hospital. I was young at the time and you really don\u0027t want issues with your hair, but that was what I was faced with.\u0027My scalp was too badly damaged to repair itself and so the medics took a skin graft from one of my legs and put that onto my head. They then cut some skin from the side of my head and put this around to the front of my forehead because there was nothing there that could be saved either. I put myself in their hands but I knew there would be more surgery to follow.\u0027          Mr Reed said: \u0027I\u0027m very happy with the procedure and though I\u0027m a little thinner than I was in my younger days, my hair is substantially better than it was before I had the transplant\u0027\u0027The saline process was very painful, it was like having your head set on fire. The implants worked, although one silicone bag split through the skin and even today my right eyebrow is at a slight angle due to not being stretched sufficiently.\u0027The accident also left me with whiplash, from which I suffered for next eight months. Overall, I felt I looked like the Elephant Man when the silicone implants were at their biggest.\u0027  Mr Reed with his wife and children after the transplant, which he is \u0027very happy\u0027 with\u0027When I was 21, no-one had heard about hair transplants and if they had, then it was only mentioned in a jokey kind of way.\u0027It was definitely not something to be taken seriously, especially for a man, it wasn\u0027t really something they were expected to consider.\u0027But I\u0027d receded to the point where there was about an inch in the centre of my forehead that stood out, it was like a little strip right in the middle. I also had some scars at the side of my head, although they weren\u0027t as much of an issue.\u0027I thought about what could be done and so decided to look into my options quite seriously. Cheaper options were available but I knew which one came with the likelihood of the best results and I was happy to go with that.\u0027Dr Farjo said: \u0027People come to us for all kinds for reasons, but Ant\u0027s story was a little different to those we normally hear. When someone begins to lose their hair, it can have quite serious implications on their mental wellbeing.\u0027And in Ant\u0027s case, his situation was complicated further by the fact that the skin grafts he\u0027d received following the crash had also impacted on his natural hairline.\u0027We\u0027re delighted that Ant has had a positive reaction to the surgery and we\u0027d urge anyone in a similar position following head trauma to seek professional help.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/13/50061AD200000578-0-image-m-46_1536668554721.jpg","title":"Remote Scottish Highlands home private beach sale 750 000","story":"    Very big house in the country: The vast estate, which is perfect for those seeking solitude or just a break from the rat race, is on a picturesque peninsula in the Highlands often described as \u0027Britain\u0027s last wilderness\u0027.

It’s a Monday and the time is going too fast. One man sweats as he checks his watch. On his way to a bank heist, perhaps.I didn’t think any of that on my train at the time, though. I revisited my journey after sinking into a white sofa and watching The Clock, Christian Marclay’s epic montage of film clips featuring clockfaces that tells the actual time. Only then, gazing at the cinema screen that’s been built at Tate Modern, did I understand that everyone on a rush-hour train is united by something magical: we’re all sharing the same instant in time.Time as we know it is a humanising fiction that binds us together. It is community. This is the life-affirming message of The Clock and, surely, the reason why it has become such awell-loved classic of contemporary art, ever since its creation eight years ago.When the screen says 8.23, I check my phone and find it’s telling the same time. A gaggle of clips from the 1950s and 60s signals that it’s time for the first cigarette of the day. Ashtrays full from the previous night are getting fresh ash tapped into them.

And Richard Burton as a cockney gangster serves his mum breakfast in bed in a clip from – I think – the 1971 film Villain.All these moments contain clocks – digital clocks, grandfather clocks, watches, alarm clocks or just the time on a TV newsflash – and that time is the same as the time your watch says. The Clock is a highly reliable clock. I am sure there is an art collector somewhere who owns a copy and projects it in the kitchen on a permanent loop to tell the time.This concordance of fictional and real time has subversive consequences. When Jimmy Cagney checks the time as he nervously waits for a big jail break, and he has the same time as you, the barrier between fiction and reality is broken. There’s an instant of empathy. You and he are in the same predicament. We are all prisoners of time.Shouldn’t that be a bleak thought? One crackling monochrome clip shows a sinister figure with a sickle. In art, the passing of time was traditionally a memento mori, a reminder of death. Hourglasses and clocks in Renaissance paintings are doom-laden symbols. The Clock, however, is not a downer at all. It’s an upper. And I use that word advisedly for the longer you watch it, the more addictive it becomes. There will be several 24-hour screenings in its Tate run, and they deserve to be packed out because time really does fly when you’re watching The Clock.This is partly due to the pleasure its sheer ingenuity inspires. The Clock is a 21st-century answer to the elaborate mechanical clocks premodern artisans built for the town halls of central European cities. Just as those ancient clocks amaze with their sculpted wooden figures that rotate on the hour as chimes resonate on cobbled squares, so we marvel at Marclay’s technical achievement. How many hours of watching films, rewinding, freezing, isolating and grabbing brief glimpses of timepieces, went into this miracle of digital craft?One question does arise about Marclay’s film. Entrancing as it is, does it actually say that much about time? Isn’t it a bit pre-Einsteinian in the way it portrays time as a single universal flow of moments? After all, modern physics sees time as non-linear. The idea of a single clock measuring out all our lives is a myth. After all, not all clocks tell the same time. Hours and minutes are a useful fiction, not an absolute.In fact, The Clock reveals this in subtle and seductive ways. Its rhythm is emotional. As the moods of different scenes and sequences change, time itself seems faster or slower. You slow to the pace of a stopped train or speed to the ticking of a time bomb.The Clock is a chronicle of cinema, a history of the modern world and a meditation on the mystery of time. It is above all a great work of art that touches the truth of being human. We fear time, but it makes us who we are. We tick to the same beat.• The Clock is at Tate Modern, London, from 14 September to 20 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/562bfbbfe921ef78cd2982f20924dc52cdc47685/0_636_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93d5d8cc9a210f35129cb2ae74555199","title":"memorable monuments to american modernism in pictures","story":"Photographs from the Pioneers of American Modernism exhibition of works by the outstanding American architectural photographer Ezra Stoller – on at the Lumiere Brothers Centre, Moscow until 2 December.

Thankfully, Peter Astbury’s award-wining health tech wristband now offers a stylish solutionPerimenopause – also known as the menopause transition – is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time. “The most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,” explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. “Migraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,” she adds.It’s the more obscure symptoms – migraines, low mood, tiredness – that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the “big taboo” of the menopause itself. This lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven’t taken hormonal changes into account. But there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause – enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause – hot flushes. At the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a “cooling tile” that delivers “intense cooling to the wrist”. The goal is to “use this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat” – a response directly opposite to a hot flush. This could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause. Astbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. “I realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,” he says. Astbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University – a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew “next to nothing about menopause”.During his research, Astbury heard stories from many women – and it was these that left the biggest impression. “I regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,” he says. As Newson – who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category – points out, women’s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way something Astbury hopes will change.“In the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don’t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,” he says. “Many cultures don’t suffer from the same taboos as us – one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.”The design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. “The aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence – the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.” Astbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: “Women are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,” he says. “I hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

The shop is profitable and would have made an estimated £30,000 in a sale, but Morris said he wanted to give someone else the chance to realise their dream of running a bookshop. Over the last three months, anyone who spent more than £20 was eligible to be entered into a raffle to win it.The name of the winner, Ceisjan Van Heerden, who is from the Netherlands, was drawn out of a hat containing 59 others at a ceremony last week, as Abba’s The Winner Takes It All played to a crowd.Morris, who worked in the book industry for years before he opened his own shop, told the  that he had chosen to take early retirement at 52 after his osteoarthritis worsened.Van Heerden wasn’t at the prize draw, said Morris. “So I left him a message, and, when he phoned back, he said he’d had to have a sit down and a cup of coffee.”Van Heerden told the Powys County Times that he was “so shocked” when he heard he had won. “I love books and read a lot and just happened to be in the shop when a TV crew was making a film about Paul’s decision to raffle it off and I bought a ticket,” said Van Heerden.He officially takes over the shop on 5 November and said he is planning to run it with a friend from Iceland, who is now moving to west Wales. Although the pair have been friends online for nine years, they have yet to meet face to face. “It might sound strange, but we are sure we can make it work. It is just an amazing opportunity,” he said.Morris said that a number of his customers had said that they had always fancied running a bookshop. He got into the business after stumbling across a retired bookseller selling around 18,000 books on eBay. “I thought it sounded fantastic. He’d moved the contents of his bookshop into his house, and wanted everything to go to the same person. We did a deal, and a friend and I drove a lorry to Great Yarmouth to collect them all.” If it wasn’t for his osteoarthritis, said Morris, he would still be running Bookends. “I always wanted to have a bookshop, but I’ve had my stint, and now it’s time for someone else to take over,” he said.

We’ll be back tomorrow. Good-bye!The unreliable boyfriend commits, says Anna Stupnytska, global economist at fund manager Fidelity International.Mark Carney’s re-appointment brings continuity to BoE policy. Compared to almost any potential successor, Carney will exert a more firmly dovish influence on UK monetary decision-making, as he has done consistently since he took the helm in 2013. While Carney expects a gradual pace of rate hikes from here, perhaps little more than one per year, as he sees out the rest of his tenure, in reality he will be driven by how smooth or disruptive Brexit turns out to be.Indeed, it is perhaps with regards to Brexit where Carney-continuity is more important, and why Theresa May was so keen to keep him on board. In addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also supervises and regulates British banks through “macro-prudential” policy. As such, investors can take some comfort that Carney is as well-placed as anyone to navigate any choppy waters that Brexit will bring to threaten Britain’s overall financial system.Regarding the process for the appointment of Carney’s successor, the chancellor wrote to the Bank of England governor:An extension of your term would ensure there is continuity at the Bank during this exceptional period and would also allow for a new governor to be appointed during the autumn next year after the terms of the UK’s withdrawal and the framework for the future partnership have been finalised.The seven-month extension of Carney’s term as Bank of England governor is shorter than some expected. He will stay on until the end of January 2020, which means he’ll be at the central bank’s helm during the withdrawal period (the UK is due to exit the EU at 11pm UK time on Friday 29 March, 2019). But he won’t be there for the entire transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, welcomed the news, our political correspondent Peter Walker reports. He told reporters after Treasury questions in the Commons:I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney.We meet on a regular basis, and I have a lot of confidence in him. So I’m pleased – this will give us a bit of stability. I wish we’d have heard a bit sooner, but that’s good.While refusing to say who he would prefer as a successor, McDonnell said he would like the new governor to be a woman: It would be useful if it was, actually. It’s nice to get a better gender balance in these things.Nigel Farage, vice chairman of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, has a different response.Nicky Morgan, who chairs the influential Treasury select committee, is pleased.This announcement provides much-needed stability and clarity during this important period. The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury committee to scrutinise the appointment.The announcement comes after weeks of speculation as to whether Carney, the former governor of Canada’s central bank, who took the Bank of England job in 2013, would agree to an extension of his term given the economic uncertainty over Brexit.You can read our full story hereYou can read the exchange of letters between Carney and Hammond here.In his letter, the chancellor said:Further to our discussions and those that I have had with the Prime Minister, I am writing to ask whether you would be able to extend your term as Governor of the Bank of England to January 2020 to support a smooth exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and an effective transition to the next Governor.” In his reply, the Bank of England governor said:I recognise that during this critical period, it is important that everyone does everything they can to support a smooth and successful Brexit. Accordingly, I am willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England and I can confirm that I would be honoured to extend my term to January 2020.”HM Treasury has also announced that Jon Cunliffe has been reappointed as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability for a second five-year term.

The drunk thing is easy to pinpoint it was my brother’s stag weekend, and we were in some Welsh town, and it was a Saturday night, and I was partly drinking to keep up with everyone and partly drinking in the vain hope that I’d black out and forget what an abjectly terrible time I was having.But the second part is much more problematic. Last night I had a G\u0026ampT because we had some gin that needed to be used up. On Saturday I had a drink because I had to live blog Strictly Come Dancing and wanted something to take the edge off what turned out to be a very specific type of horror. I drank on Friday, and on Thursday. On Wednesday I drank in a pub. On Tuesday I drank on my sofa. Just one drink, mind you. At no point during the week did I ever feel the effect of alcohol coursing through my system. Just a small drink as a token reward for getting through another day vaguely intact.Which is all very boringly polite of me, of course. But the fact is, I can’t remember the last time I had an alcohol-free day. And according to Public Health England, that’s exactly what we should all be having.High alcohol consumption leads to all sorts of problems, from obesity to cancer. But what can you do about it? Cut it out altogether? Probably, yes, but that’s no fun. Take a month off, like dry January or Go Sober for October? Maybe, but, despite the fact they’re charity-run events, it’s hard to escape the feeling that these schemes are designed for the worst kind of virtue-signalling, Justgiving-hijacking, attention-seeking dipsticks who want to experience an artificially inflated level of recognition for barely enduring any plight whatsoever.Drink-free days, meanwhile, sound like a happy medium. Have two days off from booze a week and you’ve reduced your alcohol intake by nearly a third. Have three days off and you’ve nearly halved it.Make no mistake, this campaign has been organised for middle-aged dullards like me. In my late teens and early 20s I routinely went days and days without drinking, only to overcompensate by going on a disproportionately nutso bender every fortnight or so.But with two young kids, it’s stupid of me to drink to excess any more, because toddlers don’t understand the concept of the considerate lie-in. If I wake up reeling from a big night out, bloated and sweating and pulsing with self-hatred, it’ll still have to be at quarter to six in the morning, to allow my three-year-old to jump on my head and scream the lyrics of a self-penned song entitled If You Wanna Nay-Nay.Instead, when I drink, it’s just for something to do. Prestige drama on the telly, a single bottle of beer, asleep in my clothes on the sofa by 9pm. That’s the pattern my evenings take. I don’t get drunk. I don’t cause problems. But I probably drink more now than I ever did as a teenager, which is ridiculous. Middle-aged drinking creeps up on you, and this campaign has been designed to remind you of that.Having a few deliberate alcohol-free days a week is a no-brainer, the same way as having a day or two without meat. It’s a small reduction that I won’t even notice. So sign me up. I mean, not tonight because there’s still half a bottle of wine taking up precious room in the fridge. But the day after that. Probably."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b383f8f530490ed7f472ae96d731cdd81426561/0_135_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0ba5445a1610fbf4d8be2d1aab6f35","title":"labour gig economy john mcdonnell","story":"After a long, hot summer of screaming angrily into its own navel, the Labour party is finally talking to the outside world again. Or at any rate that’s one way to look at John McDonnell’s plan to curb the gig economy, unveiled at the TUC conference. The shadow chancellor thinks there’s every chance of a general election before too long, given the parlous state of Brexit negotiations. So while Jeremy Corbyn spent the summer alternately mobilising the faithful at rallies and going round in circles over antisemitism, McDonnell was returning to the roots of what made the movement so popular in the first place: radical, sweeping, anti-establishment ideas on economic inequality.At the weekend, he proposed making larger companies split their profits with workers via share funds. Now he’s promising that under Labour all workers, including agency staff, would be entitled to rights such as sick pay and maternity pay from day one, while working relationships would be redefined in law to stop gig employers dodging their obligations via the sort of weaselly contracts that give self-employment a bad name. Bang goes the platform model pioneered (albeit since modified) by the likes of Uber, offering most of the obligations of a job minus the perks and protections to their drivers. No more zero-hour contracts across industries from pubs and restaurants to social care, either.It’s classic McDonnell bold, faintly nostalgic and brooking no exceptions. Never mind the findings of Matthew Taylor’s recent review that many people actively prefer casual work because it fits around family responsibilities or studying, or that this unusually elastic labour market may have helped Britain deliver higher wage growth. It’s all about a return to an era before employment was so routinely casualised and as such it’s likely to be very popular. People just want some security and some basic trade union rights to protect them, McDonnell told Radio 4’s Today programme, and who would disagree? Alarm about the human consequences of insecure working practices is shared on both sides of the warring Labour party. Frank Field, who recently quit to sit as an independent, was a vocal critic of gig employers and McDonnell’s announcement was welcomed by Wes Streeting, who is hardly a Corbyn fan but has plenty of black cab drivers among his Ilford constituents.But more importantly, it is also widely shared by voters who are increasingly dismayed by stories of callous treatment. It’s not just about money, it’s about feeling like a human being whose welfare actually matters to your boss.So employers wailing that McDonnell’s proposals will kill off jobs or disadvantage the British economy would do well to reflect on why they have ended up here. Talk to their workforces and it’s clear the real damage is done by combining insecure working practices with an inhumane and rigid management style, which sets ridiculously punishing daily targets while making clear that if you can’t cope then someone else could fill your boots tomorrow.Court cases brought by unions such as the IWGB (formed specifically to represent gig economy workers) and GMB have repeatedly found them to be on the wrong side of existing law. If employers hadn’t systematically pushed their luck then it wouldn’t have come to this – and while even two or three years ago McDonnell might have been successfully portrayed as a luddite trying to hold back the economic clock, now he’s moving with the mainstream. Under pressure from the unions, the courts and public opinion, gig economy employers are already tweaking their model and even Theresa May is at least theoretically committed to better holiday and sick pay rights for gig workers.The one nagging question is whether people who actually like freelancing – or at least see economic precariousness as a reasonable trade-off for not being tied down – could become the unwitting casualties of a war that isn’t about them. Self-employed work runs the full gamut now from exploitative and badly paid to liberating and lucrative, and has been a lifeline especially for working parents whose family lives don’t fit neatly into standard office hours. If Taylor is right and the expense of turning casual jobs into something more permanent means fewer jobs in the long run, McDonnell’s strategy risks unleashing some seriously perverse consequences. To make this work in practice, compromises may be necessary.But if nothing else at least we’re now back to thrashing out the pros and cons of ideas that could potentially change lives, after a summer in which both political parties had begun to seem dangerously detached from many voters’ daily reality. Politics is back, and the relief is palpable. Now let the arguments begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0408986f616a570ee18fdc54f5e8e21916a29b9e/0_220_2299_1379/master/2299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955c150a0bf0cf77b4d955cf8143cbf7","title":"populism eu hungary orchestras conductor","story":"Human rights are under attack from populist and nationalist movements across the world – in Hungary, Italy, Poland, the US and elsewhere. These forces encourage their supporters to look inward and reject the outsider, whether it is an idea or a migrant on a boat. We need to overcome this narrow focus and look out for the interests of everyone.Because the biggest challenges of today and tomorrow, from climate change to migration, are international, they are minutely interconnected. Inidual governments cannot tackle them alone and should not act unilaterally. I say this as someone who has spent his professional life conducting orchestras – the world needs conductors. The conductor ensures that all the sections of the orchestra are in harmony. A populist credo such as “America first” is like having the first violins playing their own tempo regardless of the other groups. In the case of Hungary, the European parliament should lead and coordinate. On Wednesday, MEPs will vote on whether the EU should trigger article 7 of the Lisbon treaty, a legal process that could lead to sanctions on Hungary in response to restrictions on freedom of expression and the independence of the judiciary. MEPs have an opportunity (and, I think, an obligation) to help to save Hungary from its own populist dissonance.I have had the privilege of conducting Wagner in Bayreuth, Mozart in Salzburg and Verdi in Milan. In such productions singers and musicians from all over the world work together. Music has always been an international profession. In the 18th century, Handel, a German, was living in London and Salieri, an Italian, in Vienna. Music brings people together as we make it, obliging us to speak on behalf of people who have no voice.Hungary is one of the least international of the EU member nations, with a low rate of foreign language learning. Left unchecked, the government of Viktor Orbán will continue to undermine pluralism and further marginalise voiceless minorities.I am a member of the Helsinki Committee – a human rights organisation originally founded in the Soviet Union in 1976. Our work is exemplified by the need to protect the international Central European University in Budapest, which is under threat of closure from the Hungarian government.This summer, I took a taxi in Budapest, and the driver told me that all migrants were terrorists and the worst thing any government could do was to allow them into the country. Notions like this, and the idea that migration is part of an international conspiracy, poison a country. I would welcome a debate on the real dangers of populism, the kind of thinking that would allow migrants to die at sea rather than being rescued.Supporting article 7 – the clause setting out sanctions against member nations when they are found to have breached the EU’s founding values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities – would encourage the country to look beyond the government’s insidious propaganda that misinformed my taxi driver. Today we are facing the same arguments against groups supporting human rights that were made 40 years ago under communism and 80 years ago under nazism. The techniques of autocratic power are the same, and freedom is in danger across Europe once again.By voting yes on Wednesday, the European parliament can show that it understands both our collective past and the necessity of a collaborative future, and is prepared to stand with us on the right side of history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add215f6f441d3e43d7411826322c9bf44b6c170/0_301_4761_2857/master/4761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8979c6a311aef1e49598d5d19c13a0a","title":"remainers voters brexiters","story":"The main challenge isn’t to win over Brexiters, it’s to get people to re-engage with an issue they just want to go awayThere is no rule that says people have to be interested in the things politicians want them to care about. For years, Eurosceptics got that wrong. Most British citizens went about their lives unbothered by the European Union. Brussels was an object of compulsive loathing for only a tiny number. Their good fortune was to find in David Cameron a malleable prime minister who could be pressed into calling a referendum on a question few voters had ever thought to ask themselves. The cranks got their hobby horse into the political Grand National – and, credit where it’s due,\u0026nbspthey won.That campaign raised the volume of EU debate without making the topic more appealing. June 2016 was when Britain’s collective receptiveness to European arguments peaked. A question was asked an answer was given: leave. How to make it happen was someone else’s\u0026nbspproblem.Disengagement is the biggest obstacle to the cause of reversing Brexit. Now unrepentant remainers also come across as cranks, banging on about Europe in ways that cause agnostic eyes to glaze over. I have seen research in this area for one pro-European campaign group, and it is a rebuke to anyone who follows each twist of the negotiations, each barrage in the Tory civil war, and imagines that the nation is gripped.“I don’t think I’ve heard anything about Brexit since the vote itself,” one young voter declares in a focus group. The participants were selected for readiness to switch between leave and remain positions. Many recall the 2016 campaign as a time of anxiety, even trauma. They resented being forced to choose between options they felt ill-equipped to evaluate, and are in no hurry to relive the experience. Few see Brexit as an imminent personal threat. It is either something settled in the past or whose meaning will be revealed in the far future.With that audience lies Theresa May’s hope of survival. Her Chequers plan is floating motionless in the North Sea, shot down by EU officials and Tory backbenchers. Negotiations in Brussels are not going well and time is short. To get a sane, workable deal, the prime minister must make compromises that would outrage her party’s hardliners. And there is no majority in parliament for the kind of wild Brexit that those same hardliners could cheer. The walls are closing in, winter is coming, it has been an epic journey and tension is building ahead of the season finale …But that is a Westminster show and most people haven’t been watching. They will only tune in when there is a deal. Then Downing Street has one powerful argument: back this offer and Brexit is done you don’t need to read the small print (which is boring), you just need to know that this is our chance to move on. This\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspclosure.Many Tory MPs will embrace that message with enthusiasm. Some Labour MPs will also see the attraction, but not enough to lend votes to a Conservative government at its moment of maximum peril. Meanwhile, Tory hardliners will denounce the deal as submission to foreign powers. Neville Chamberlain’s paper-waving return from Munich will be invoked early and often.Then it is a numbers game: can May muster enough MPs for a just-get-on-with-it Brexit bodge to outweigh the combined forces of stoppers and wreckers? And if not, what happens? That is where those running the campaign for a People’s Vote see their window. They anticipate a moment where three streams flow together: the public has re-engaged with Brexit because there is a deal MPs say it is a bad deal no one has a better idea. Giving the people the option to call the whole thing off then looks not only feasible, but unavoidable.That is only a route map to keeping EU membership in play, not a strategy for winning the ensuing argument. The remain flame has been sustained by a coalition of pro-European idealists, who see themselves holding the line against a xenophobic putsch, and managerial pragmatists, who lament a reckless act of economic and strategic self-sabotage. Those positions have not changed in the 27 months since the referendum, which is a long time for people who thought the argument was over. There might be more evidence now to support the case against Brexit. It is plainly not the thing it was advertised to be. But remainers have not got noticeably better at marshalling the facts on their side for mass persuasion.Political warfare over EU relations has raged unabated within already politicised circles and it is hard for the combatants to grasp that it has all just been shadow-boxing. They have only been warming up for the big fight. Remainers have spent a lot of energy arguing with people who believe in Brexit, whose passion for it mirrors their hatred, because those are the only people who can be bothered to argue back. The moment is approaching when they will meet a tougher challenge: that sea of people beyond Westminster who neither love nor hate the EU, who had no strong feelings about membership before they were asked in 2016 and have none now, except perhaps a yearning to get the question out of their lives.The simplest way to achieve that has generally been to have faith that some kind of deal – any deal – will be done, and not bother with the details. But if the deal comes back a dud, or there is no deal at all, the calculus changes. If Brexit starts to look like a gruelling odyssey, dragging on for years, with real costs now and long into the future, the case for calling it off can be made – and won. But that argument hasn’t properly started yet. It is possible that all of the ideological and technical squabbling, the factional bickering that has consumed politics since the referendum, will turn out to have been only the preamble. And what it will all come down to in the end is a contest between two gut propositions that have very little to do with the EU. For leave: just get on with it. For remain: please just make it stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db7c384ff2c3308246bf047eadfa6603db9ba33/0_95_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43c51598b6cc409f8b8fc4137082095","title":"second brexit referendum ireland lisbon polls","story":"Ever since the UK made the decision to exit the European Union in 2016 there has been a simmering political and public debate on revisiting the outcome in a second referendum. As the Brexit negotiations enter the endgame, a formal campaign for a People’s Vote on the final deal has gathered pace, although the proposition remains contentious. Theresa May claims that a second referendum would be a betrayal of democracy: strong words.In exploring the legitimacy of holding a second referendum it is worth looking at how and why this has been done in other EU member states. Both Denmark and Ireland held second referendums on EU treaties within 18 months of the first ballot. There is a widespread perception that these second votes were held at the behest of the EU and that these small states were bullied into doing so.This fundamentally misrepresents the political dynamics involved. In all cases governments, with the support of their parliaments, engaged in a sophisticated political exercise of managing the cross-cutting dynamics of domestic and EU-level politics. The exercise of national political authority was to the fore.How was this achieved? The Irish government played for time at home. It turned to research to understand voter attitudes, commissioning a comprehensive academic study on the behaviour of the electorate. By September 2008, the government had solid evidence on why voters voted the way they did, and could begin to craft a strategy. Armed with the results, the Irish parliament interrogated Ireland’s future in the EU, and its deliberations led to the publication of a report titled Ireland’s Future in the European Union: Challenges, Issues and Options. While the people had spoken through a referendum, representative democracy reasserted its core role in the Irish political system and the quality of debate underlined the seriousness of the issues at stake.At the same time, the Irish government engaged intensively with its EU partners. Neither side wanted to lose the Lisbon treaty. By December 2008, the broad outline of a deal was emerging which included the retention of one commissioner per state and legal guarantees on issues such as taxation, security and abortion. Next came the difficult task of translating this into a document. The Irish negotiators met every member state government at least twice and many three or four times between January and June 2009 to achieve agreement. On the eve of the June 2009 European council meeting, the then Irish prime minister, Brian Cowen, wrote to his counterparts saying that without legally binding guarantees he was unwilling to hold a referendum. With such guarantees, the government was prepared to go back to the electorate to ask “is this your final answer?”Three facets of the second campaign contributed to the decisive win. First, the yes campaign mobilised in a different way: political parties and civil society organisations ran an intensive campaign across all media and on the ground. The active involvement of civil society was important, given the government’s unpopularity. A number of highly influential people, including Seamus Heaney, agreed to act as patrons of Ireland for Europe, the largest civil society organisation. Before reciting one of his poems at the launch of the campaign, Seamus said, “There are many reasons for ratifying the Lisbon treaty, reasons to do with our political and economic wellbeing, but the poem speaks mainly for our honour and identity as Europeans.”Second, the yes campaign was much more effective in framing the agenda. In the first referendum, it was reactive and not particularly persuasive. Second time out, the campaign put the importance of Ireland’s relationship with the EU centre stage while having credible text warriors, who knew the treaty, bat on air and in the print media against the no campaign by taking on inaccurate or exaggerated claims. “Do not believe the lies” became the line on a number of very effective posters.Third, the coverage of the campaign, particularly by RTE, the national broadcaster, was very different. For the first Lisbon referendum, RTE deployed a conflict frame akin to a Punch-and-Judy contest between yes and no, with little or no editorial intervention to challenge or correct inaccurate claims. Second time around, the conflict frame was accompanied by a responsibility frame, ie that the issue was salient and had to be taken seriously. The broadcaster took to heart its duty to accurately inform and educate.Was the second vote a travesty of democracy? More people voted in the second referendum and the treaty was carried in urban and rural Ireland and across all socioeconomic groups. Moreover, people felt that they had a much better grasp of the issues. A democracy has the right to change its mind.• Brigid Laffan chaired the civil society organisation Ireland for Europe in 2009"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea90fa8a78ce668746256515b35d8f16829a443c/25_0_5198_3120/master/5198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c321edf1e9e603a4484cb2490bda98","title":"freshers guide what to take to university","story":"Forget a printer – a bumbag, fancy dress and a brolly need to be on every new student’s packing listStudents preparing to head off for university already know they need a laptop, bedding and a corkscrew … but what else might come in useful?

This adds to the perception that they are not welcome here.”Jasmine Whitbread, the chief executive of the business group London First, said: “The MAC has recognised that international students are a boon to the economy, contributing £2.3bn each year in the capital alone.“With firms struggling to fill skills gaps and vacancies outstripping the people available to fill them, it is economic madness to send these talented youngsters packing as soon as their studies are over.“That’s why the government should bring back a post-study work visa, take students out of the net migration target completely, and better still, scrap it.”A spokeswoman for the British Chambers of Commerce said: “Business communities around the UK will be bitterly disappointed not to see support for the removal of overseas students from the immigration statistics. We have been calling for the removal of these students from the immigration figures for a long time, as the vast majority go home after completing their courses.“It’s time to scrap the caps and arbitrary numerical targets. It’s one thing to control migration, but quite another to use arbitrary mechanisms that deny businesses, universities and public sector employers the people they need to address immediate skills gaps.”James Pitman, of Destination for Education, a coalition of language course providers, said: “This report is a huge missed opportunity to strengthen international education in the UK. The committee acknowledges the sector will be disappointed. We are.“We had hoped the committee would set out meaningful recommendations to help the UK recover market share. But maintaining the status quo will do nothing to restore Britain’s leadership in education exports. Our international competitors will continue to outperform us.”The committee said there was scope to increase the number of international students in the UK and recommended not introducing a cap.Amber Rudd, the then home secretary, when commissioning the report last year, said the government wanted to keep the door open to “genuine” students but would crack down on the abuse of visas by poor-quality institutions.The report, published on Tuesday, rebuked the government for sending “mixed messages” about international students.In his foreword, the MAC chairman, Prof Alan Manning, said: “When engaging with the sector, some seemed to be concerned the government had plans to introduce a cap.“Many do not trust the government: when the commissioning letter also wrote ‘there is no limit on the number of genuine international students’, they may wonder what the phrase ‘genuine’ means.“What the government means and what many in the sector think thegovernment means are not aligned.”The report later adds: “We do think it would be helpful if the government avoided sending mixed messages about its plans regarding international students.“Based on the evidence gathered for this report, we do not recommend any toughening of visa requirements, so a clear statement on this would also reassure. It would be better to loosen visa requirements as much as possible.”The committee did not recommend removing students from the net migration target of tens of thousands, saying it would be “difficult technically, and if done correctly would make almost no difference to the net migration figures”.Theresa May has repeatedly rejected suggestions that the UK should exclude international students from official migration figures.The committee recommended that the post-study leave-to-remain period for master’s students be extended from four to six months.In addition, the committee said the 12 months leave to remain after completion of a PhD should be automatically built in to the original visa duration – it currently has to be applied for, with associated costs.The advisers stopped short of introducing a separate post-study work visa, which they acknowledged would disappoint some in the education sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bedc8a6149dca4e03ce4318d3cafe1b5bd460d06/0_130_3902_2341/master/3902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88190b2ada9b04b555c2e186d59cd1e1","title":"nort south schools divide not supported by evidence","story":"Major study of 1.8 million pupils also challenges ministers’ claims children do better in academies and grammarsClaims that schools in the north of England are worse than those in the south are based on myth and bad data, according to a large-scale research project that calls into question the education policies of successive governments.The study also challenges the idea that selective grammar schools or academies are more likely to improve pupil progress overall than community comprehensives, tracing the progress of 1.8 million pupils, their social, family and economic backgrounds and the type of schools they attended.The analysis of three annual cohorts of 600,000 pupils each was carried out by Prof Stephen Gorard, director of the Durham University evidence centre for education, who says he found no evidence that schools in the north or north-east are differentially effective or ineffective with equivalent pupil intakes.“What my new analysis suggests is that schools in some areas are not doing a worse job, they simply do not have an equivalent mix of children,” he says. “The most important factor that determines school test and exam results is not the quality of teaching or leadership but who they teach, the proportion of pupils who are disadvantaged through poverty, family circumstances or special educational needs and most crucially the length of time they have been disadvantaged.”Last week Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, renewed warnings he made while in office about “the differential in performance between secondary schools in the north, Midlands and south of England”, which he said could not be explained by economic factors. Senior politicians, including George Osborne, the former chancellor, have also raised concerns about the north-south education gap.Gorard’s findings, in his new book Education Policy: Evidence of equity and effectiveness, are likely to be uncomfortable reading for policymakers. Instead of experimenting with different types of school, the evidence suggests the government should be directing even more resources to improving the life chances of disadvantaged children, he says.Gorard, a researcher with a string of publications, believes in the transformative power of education – he taught maths and computing in London and Wales for 13 years before going into academia – and is on a mission to find evidence of what works. However, he is frustrated by policymakers not wanting to listen. “Politicians hear what they want to hear – they adopt or accept evidence that suits their prior beliefs and values,” he says.“I have never understood why education ministers want to bring in a small number of new schools that they claim are better, but only for a small number of people. Surely their responsibility has to be to make education as good as it can be for everybody, which means you can’t have different types of school for specific regions or families.”The 1944 Education Act was supposed to create a national education system and give poorer children a fairer chance instead, the country has ended up with at least 200 different types of schools, he says. “It is almost criminal, what people have been doing with education. The act was brought in at least partly to reduce the impact of family background on attainment. “If they had firm evidence that academy schools were better, why did they introduce just 200 of them? Surely every family deserves to have this ‘better’ type of school,” he says.He adds: “Politicians stand up and say without offering any evidence ‘I believe academies or specialist schools or free schools are better schools and so we are going to have them in a few selected places and nowhere else’. People don’t boo and hiss at them, as they would if politicians offered better hospitals for only parts of the country.”Gorard cites the case of Andrew Adonis – the Labour peer and former minister – who claimed success for his original academy schools because they had higher attainment scores than their predecessor schools, without considering the fact they had changed their intakes.“It’s the same problem with the north-south ide … The difference between their test and exam results is not due to the standard of teaching or leadership but the prior attainment and challenges of the sort of children they take.”Gorard finds the present method of calculating social deprivation – eligibility for free school meals – less than ideal because it fails to include some children living in poverty whose families slip through the system, it does not take into account the length of time a child has lived in poverty, or adequately reflect a child’s special educational needs.Headteachers say Gorard’s findings confirm their experience. Schools most in need of support are being stigmatised by the failure to fully take their context into account, says Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “We agree socio-economic disadvantage is the main factor holding back the progress of pupils but it does not negate the influence of schools, which are a lifeline for many young people.”Paul Miller, professor of educational leadership and management at Huddersfield University, also believes heads and teachers can make a difference. “Social background and poverty impact on attainment but there are many examples of schools that have been very successful in taking students forward despite these disadvantages,” he says.Gorard says his work is driven by data, not prejudices: “I have never belonged to a political party. I am not for or against any type of school. If someone convinces me that one type of school is better than another I am really happy because it means we can improve the system. I have no ideological aversion to selection. If we could show that iding children into academically able groups produced better results for everybody, I would not argue against it. It’s just that it doesn’t.”“The data shows that despite all these whizzo ideas for subsets of schools, underneath it all we have reasonably good teachers and reasonably good schools across the country. Once we know the effect of long-term disadvantage on attainment, then we can direct money to help those children get to what should be a universal entitlement, for example, based on the length of time they have been eligible for free school meals.“We have to determine through evidence what works best and provide it for everyone.”Education Policy: Evidence of equity and effectiveness by Stephen Gorard (Policy Press, £24.99).

Amazing player.”Little has been the heartbeat of Arsenal’s midfield during her two spells at the club, and with Seattle Reign and Melbourne City between times, and she plays a similarly important role for her national team.It was fitting, with Scotland needing to beat Albania and better Switzerland’s result to secure automatic qualification, that it was Little, assisted by Lizzie Arnot, who scored the volley that put Scotland ahead before Jane Ross added the winner.Why fitting? Because last year, Little and Manchester United’s Arnot were forced out of Shelley Kerr’s Euro 2017 squad with ACL injuries, while Ross picked up a shoulder injury in the first game.Scotland were devastated by injuries in the run-in to their first major finals. Manchester City’s Jen Beattie and Arsenal’s Emma Mitchell were two more on the treatment table instead of in the Netherlands.Yet despite that they still finished third in their group, two goals shy of a place in the last 16. Euro 2017 was a what-if competition for the Scots. Now, with a fully fit squad, they have topped their qualifying group, a maiden World Cup awaits and, finally, Little will be seen by a global audience.“It’s been an unbelievable seven to 10 days,” says the midfielder modestly. “I kind of take each game and experience as it comes so it’s not something I or we thought about too much. It’s an unusual feeling for me personally, and I think probably for the team, because we’ve never experienced direct qualification on the last day and having it all wrapped up.”At 28, Little still has time on her side but a fear of further injury jeopardising her chance of making the trip to France is inescapable. “I think it’s maybe natural to fear that as a player, especially if you’ve been through it before. I may fear it a bit, but it’s not something that hampers me or stops me from being so excited by it.”“It just adds a little more, it’s a satisfying feeling being able to do it with people you see every day and spend a lot of time with.”At club level things are starting to click, too. Arsenal beat West Ham 3-1 in the Continental Cup and in their opening WSL fixture on Sunday they put five past Neil Redfearn’s Liverpool – with both Little and Evans scoring.Last season, they were a team in transition and a poor start saw them quickly fall behind Chelsea and Manchester City resulting in manager Pedro Martínez Losa’s departure in October. Under the Australian Joe Montemurro they started on a new journey. “It was our consistency,” says Little. “We obviously had quite a big change during the season last year with the manager coming in.“Joe instantly made an improvement in our ability to be consistent and to win games, but again I think inevitably it kind of tapered off, we couldn’t keep that going. The size of the squad we had at that time, a lot of injuries, myself just coming back, showed in the results.”Little already knew Montemurro from her loan spell with Melbourne City after the NWSL season and he made a good impression. “I really liked the way Joe worked, I liked his sessions, his philosophy, just his demeanour and the way he is as a person. When you can relate to someone as a person it helps a lot on the football side of things.”Now, with Viktoria Schnaderbeck joining from Bayern Munich, Lia Wälti and Tabea Kemme from Turbine Potsdam and Pauline Peyraud-Magnin from Lyon, they look like title challengers. “We’ve had a pre-season together now, we’ve got some great new signings which I think will be influential and I keep repeating to the girls: ‘Play each game as if it’s the most important game you’ll ever play in.’ We just need to have the consistency and that mentality throughout the year. I have no doubt that we have the ability and talent to be the best team. We’ve got such ridiculously talented players here.”Little could have had her pick of clubs when her time in Seattle came to an end, but she opted for a second spell in north London. “I’ve got a lot of history with Arsenal. I’m a very loyal person. I had different offers but I came back here because I saw a plan, something I could really help and develop and taking this team back to being one of the best in Europe.“I like that process, I like doing all the little bits that people don’t see to improve things and I could really see that here, the club was doing the right things and had but just needed to find our identity.”• European qualification for the World Cup is almost complete.

This undercuts the African Union’s own mediation and there have been claims Russia is using them to negotiate access to diamonds, gold and uranium in rebel-controlled areas.It is not only in CAR that western officials have been caught off-guard by Russia’s escalating interest in Africa.Senior officials including Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of the Russian federation council (and a close ally of Vladimir Putin), have led the charge to sign military cooperation deals.In a high profile visit in March, Lavrov visited Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe, signing a raft of agreements for economic zones, mineral exploration and for military and technical cooperation.In July it was the turn of Dmitry Shugaev, director of Russia’s federal service for military and technical cooperation, who appeared on the edges of the BRICS summit to announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Southern African Development Community for military cooperation, including training.Foreign policy experts, who have noted the sharp rise in Russian engagement in Africa, believe it is being driven by several factors.One reason is the threat of diplomatic isolation from Europe and the US over Moscow’s policies in Syria and before that Ukraine. This has pushed the Kremlin to seek African allies, not least for their votes at the UN general assembly.“When it started its return in the last couple of years the Russian position in Africa was in a sorry state particularly in comparison with China.“It can’t offer consumer goods like China but what it can offer is arms and occasional debt relief either in exchange for an arms deal or the rights to explore and drill for hydrocarbons or other extractables.“What we are seeing is a Russian return that is trying to find a niche where they can be competitive. The niche they really own is arms.”And while the main effort has been fronted primarily by senior Russian officials, Stronski adds, the second level of engagement has drawn in a familiar cast of characters from the twilight world of Putin proxies including businessmen and private military contractors like Wagner, not least in the CAR.Like other observers, Thierry Vircoulon, of the International Crisis Group, sees a Russian strategy that mixes business, diplomatic and arms sales interests.“The relationship has expanded since that time with the compensation for Russian companies being access to the country’s minerals in exchange for military services.”Vircoulon argues, however, that there is a profound difference between the last period of Russian interest in Africa, at the height of Soviet influence, and today.“The difference is that now it is not as clear cut. Russia is using private military contractors who, while not officially linked to the Kremlin, are linked to the Kremlin. It its not even much of a disguise and they are targeting the regimes that do have not have very good relations with the west or who are dissatisfied with west like Sudan, Zimbabwe and CAR.”It has not only been in the sphere of Russian military services that the Kremlin has been active.Russia has been busy reactivating its old person-to-person networks, many forged during the Cold War when young activists and fighters in the African liberation studied in Moscow.But perhaps as striking as the presence of military advisors in CAR has been been Russian attempts to build a base in the Horn of Africa.While efforts to open a base in Djibouti were rebuffed, Sergei Lavrov announced in September that Russia was planning to open a logistics site in Eritrea on the Red Sea, joining a rush of other countries setting up in the Horn, also suggesting that UN sanctions on Eritrea be lifted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4019fa8c367a8d77d61c7ddeb81288e16bc0982/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d88aec0662bd013b5d6713f67b42f3ab","title":"mit is the best university for graduate jobs says ranking","story":"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology claims the top spot for the first timeThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has beaten Stanford University to the top spot for the first time since QS, a higher education think tank, began ranking universities according to graduate outcomes.There are seven British universities in the top 50 – one more than last year.

The cheering erupts when the star (or, at least, what appears to be the star) is wheeled in on a hospital trolley. Whoops greet her almost magical reappearance atop a plinth, in a red and plastic outfit and peaked cap, looking like a cyborg cinema usher. There are cheers for the costume changes, the bit where she gets the whole audience to sit down, and even for inidual lyrics. The Kansas singer seems genuinely moved.At 32, she has crowds eating out of her hand because, to paraphrase Rod Stewart, she can rap, sing, dance and do just any old thing. With Monáe and band at times coming over like a modern, female-fronted version of Prince and the Revolution, her music seems to dip into soul, P-Funk, blues, electronica, New Orleans jazz, pop and ragtime, while providing a vehicle for her agenda and her personality.Sometimes it is felt that, on record, she hides herself behind a human-robot persona. Tonight, she delivers no between-song chat or any personal anecdotes, and at times displays the enigmatic quality of Prince or Bowie. But she certainly hurls herself into performance, whether yelling, “Manchester! Welcome to the Monáe experience!” or weaving in a worldview that runs from environmentalism (referenced, with rioting, in films illustrating the anthemic Screwed) to Black Lives Matter and #MeToo.As Monáe edges closer towards the mainstream, there is more sex than there once was, but she resists sexualisation, and takes ownership of her much discussed pansexuality on her own terms. “Tonight you’re going to find out how I love. Happy pride!” she beams, knowingly, before more pointed comments about how “we all need to embrace who we are, even if it makes others uncomfortable”. She mentions LGBT rights, women’s rights and immigration. Sexism is challenged with Django Jane’s euphorically received lines such as “let the vagina have a monologue”, while Donald Trump’s infamous “Grab ’em by the pussy” remarks are not so subtly smacked down with R\u0026ampB stomper I Got the Juice’s “This pussy grab you back (hey!)”. Pynk celebrates empowerment and cunnilingus, but she is funny as well as woke: there are shrieks of delight as Monáe and dancers unveil their celebrated “vagina pants”.Her most Prince-like moment – Dirty Computer’s irresistibly funky Make Me Feel – makes a mockery of the fact that somehow this hugely acclaimed woman has never had a hit. In a way, her career is at the point her late sometime mentor’s was before Purple Rain – just waiting for one massive song to make a mega breakthrough.Monáe is using broader strokes than she did in smaller venues, though, and things have been lost and gained. Big-lunged ballad Prime Time – incorporating a bit of Prince’s Purple Rain – becomes a wall of noise. Tightrope showcases her extraordinary vocal range but is dragged out longer than the Crimean war. A section where audience members are hauled up to dance feels, by the fourth person, like too much padding. But the upside is the mass euphoria that greets Amy Winehouse-type stomper Cold War or empowerment anthem Q.U.E.E.N., the waves of delight as she sits on a throne wearing an outfit of piano keys, and the liberating feeling of a celebration of something that really matters.• At the Roundhouse, London, on 11 and 12 September, sold out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7151d153d474326db40ccee139472e0c0037bed6/221_201_2101_1260/master/2101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecb6f2d211f2ba283b746fd2b2b0983e","title":"wolf alice webchat mercury visions of a life","story":"The Mercury prize nominees weighed in on their favourite films, their next album and dressing up for Halloween as Liam GallagherJoel: Thanks for the questions.Theo: Get off the internet and go to your local music venues and ask the bartender some questions like how much is a pint?Ellie: Keep snakebite alive.Currently sat in sixth-form free period.

That’s where the disease had likely lodged itself, the maid’s six-year-old grandson explained. I was carrying my father’s remains. The boy walked beside me, already a veteran of the funeral pyre.Only hours earlier, he had ridden his rickety bicycle to the front door of my ancestral house, which was an act forbidden in normal times. Sweat dripped from his palms his face and ears looked hot. It was not yet time to return, he said, his voice almost out of range. The boy lived on the outskirts of the village near the cremation ground. He seemed to know something I didn’t: the body can burn for a long time.Dressed in white, men and women from low castes arrived and congregated in our courtyard. We drank tea from the same cups. They had promised not to wail, giving the occasion a western sensibility. So we waited, mostly in silence, except occasionally a relative would walk over with specific advice. An aunt handed me a white cotton bag. “Ash can be heavy,” she said. “Hold it from the bottom like a full grocery bag.”This was Punjab in 2013, where in villages such as Khanpur, a seven-hour drive from Delhi, a variation of feudalism has remained intact. The villagers considered the entire place my family’s jagir, a land reward we had received from Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the early 1800s, placing us at the top of the hierarchy. Farmers and workers called my father Sardar, their lord. For three generations, the men in my family had lived primarily in the west, but had returned to Khanpur toward the ends of their lives.“Take me back to India,” my father had said to me on a rainy London evening as we drove home after his last hospital appointment, bumping along Fulham Road, whose bends had become familiar. Deciding where to die was a test of his immigrant loyalties, and he chose India. He was unfazed by the fact that essentials such as oxygen tanks and nurses were unavailable in rural parts of the country. Morphine shortages risked turning a cancer death into a brutal ordeal.So from spring to summer, I relocated to Khanpur. I resented the disruption this posed to my career and personal life. I worried mostly about what my father’s sickness might reveal about me.As I waited for the pyre to cool down, I escaped to the rooftop, from which, as children, my sister and I used to peek into other people’s homes. A tight world of rooftops, some lit, some eclipsed by shadows. You could still hop, climb one wall and jump off another. We sensed the asymmetry then, in the height and sizes of homes, between our world and our neighbours’.Around midday, the boy returned with an update: the earth was cool enough to collect the remains. I grabbed the empty white bag and walked out the front door. The women stayed behind and the men followed me.I walked down an uneven path that cut through the village square. I reached the village periphery, turned on to an unpaved path and walked past a school largely built by my family. I could see the dusty imprints of children’s feet.When I arrived at the cremation ground, a dry patch of land surrounded by verdant fields, the maid’s grandson was sitting on a low-hanging branch. He had remained there until dawn, watching my father’s body burn slowly and keeping the vultures away. Now he watched me as I took a stick and sieved through the ash, discovering a layer of pale gray powder first, and then some of my father’s nails.The scent of sandalwood and ghee rose from the ground. Tractors roared in nearby fields. I was glad for the noise. Relatives and village elders stood around, awkwardly waiting for me to invite them to pick the remains, to turn this into a communal act. “Come,” I said, and they all stepped forward.I went off toward the lower body, squatted and dug my hands into the pile of residue. The ash was paste-like, thick and soft, altered by the gallons of butter we had poured on the pyre. Even in the gentle breeze, it adhered to the ground.At the right arm I found my father’s silver bangle, the one he had worn most of his life. “Mr Singh, could you please remove that,” the nurses would say to him back in London during each treatment.It was a short walk back. Family and villagers had gathered in the village square. My aunt explained that the house was empty so I could complete the last ritual. I would take my father’s remains back to the house, walk through every single room, and ask him to come with me. “Speak to him loudly and tell him it’s time to leave the house,” she said.I entered the house with one hand on top of the bag and one on the bottom so the sediments wouldn’t blow in the wind. Three crows sat on the outer wall. It was quiet.Standing alone in the courtyard, as I was about to whisper the words, I stumbled. This place, seemingly at the edge of the world, had been an important nexus between India and the west for my family for more than a century first, for my great-grandfather, who emigrated to the US in the early 1900s then for my grandfather, who left for England and finally, for my father. I was up against the multiple legacies of my ancestors, who had gone abroad and returned to die here. This property, where I now stood, had been their cure to what Edward Said called “the crippling sorrow of estrangement”.I reminded myself of my other life. I wasn’t a sardar, and the US was my home. I was in a same-sex relationship, and the fact that my partner was a Muslim American whose parents were born in Pakistan meant the Indian authorities would not readily give him a visa. In fact, he wasn’t at my side now for this very reason.I began to close the bedroom doors, the wooden doors with rusted nails, unsure as to how and when I would ever return.Our house in Khanpur was built in two phases. The older part, a red brick tower with arched windows and stained glass built in the early 1920s, was designed with specific purposes: to showcase the family wealth, to place the men of the house so high that others would need to look up, and to encase the women of the house so they could gaze out but not be seen.Growing up, I heard stories about its construction: how the brick had come from Multan, the peacock murals from Amritsar, and the stained glass from Delhi. Most importantly, the money was sent from some rural farm in Yuba City, California, where my great-grandfather, Puran Singh, worked as a peach farmer. He was among the first south Asians to set foot on American soil in the early 1900s.As our house was constructed, people travelled on foot from nearby towns and villages to marvel not only at the building but at the abundance and opportunities a brush with the US could bring. For a long time, our house was known as Amerika-wallan da Kar, the house of the Americans.The second part of the house was built in the late 1950s with my grandfather Bawa Singh’s earnings from his work at a Dunlop factory in Coventry, in the British West Midlands. Just as the dollar-funded tower was tall, the sterling-funded house was sprawling, as if my grandfather were saying to his father: You built high, now I will build long. Soon our house became England-wallan da Kar, the house of the English.I was six years old when I first came to Khanpur, in 1984. Faced with old age and early dementia, Bawa Singh had asked my father to take him back to India. He obliged, and since my mother didn’t want to leave us behind, the entire family relocated from Coventry.I remember walking into the courtyard and meeting a woman who was sitting cross-legged, cleaning her glasses with the ends of her dupatta. She was my step-grandmother, and this was the first I learned of her existence. A short, fierce woman, she married into the family in the 1930s. She bore no children, and was left behind after the rest of the family emigrated to England. So when we showed up on that hot summer’s day, exhausted by the travel, it was no surprise that she didn’t get up to offer us even a glass of water.We called her Mataji, meaning “respected mother”. That was how she had been known to the village for so long that even my parents couldn’t remember her actual name. She didn’t like the adults we came with, but she took to my sister and me. During our seven-year stay in India, we attended a boarding school several hours away from Khanpur. When we returned for summer holidays, Mataji would stand at the doorstep of the house, ready to pour a few drops of mustard oil by our feet to ward off evil spirits, welcoming us as if we had returned from a long exile.This role, of waiting and welcoming, was familiar to her. The story of this house and of Punjab, she would say, is not about the men who left but the women who stayed behind.Through those long years as the sole occupant of the house, night after night, she was the one who lit the oil lamps and left them by the door. She would climb the tower every day and gaze out of the stained-glass windows, updating her mental map of the village. She built a wide network of patronage, slotting each person into their deserved role.As a child, I had this sense that the world was fractured. Every day, people showed up at our front door with their troubles. This desperation, which unfolded on our doorstep, was often met with benevolence, but was never to be mistaken for intimacy or trust. We were not them, and they could never be us. I could play with the children of the village, but I was prohibited from eating with them, from drinking milk from their cows, from ever talking about my family. And they were never allowed into our courtyard and bedrooms. “Some people have you in their prayers, most have you in their curses,” Mataji would remind me every time I struck up a friendship with a kid from the village.My father was 16 when he got on a plane to England, in 1962, but no one came to receive him on the other side. He searched the airport for hours, looking for an uncle who should have been waiting at the terminal. Two pounds was all he had in his pocket – a customary amount that newcomers from the subcontinent carried. He also had the address of a distant relative who lived in London.He followed the crowd out into the damp night and stood outside long enough to realise the black cars that came and went were taxis. He got into one and arrived at the only address he knew. When the door swung open, a Jamaican man asked my father his name, and informed him that the relative was at work and would return in the morning. My father waited. The next day, he sent a telegram to his parents, asking them to come and get him. An uncle eventually showed up. In a borrowed Morris 1100, my father arrived a week later in Coventry, the town that supplied Jaguars to the world.I’ve often wondered if that was the moment when his relationship with this adopted country soured. Dislocation of time, of place and language, experienced so acutely on arrival. To have waited and watched the quiet agony in the faces of arriving immigrants gaining a foothold in a strange land. To have told himself he was different: that it was ambition, and not desperation, that had compelled him to get on that plane. After all, although he was a worker here, he was the son of a lord back home.England was not a place with which one fell in love instantly. Coventry, one of the English cities most bombed in the second world war, was still recovering. The terraced house on Coronation Road, where my father lived with his parents and two brothers, along with a roster of newly arrived immigrants, was shockingly underdeveloped. There was no central heating in the house a fireplace in the living room was the only source of heat. My father quickly realised that outer appearances mattered in achieving assimilation, so he cut his hair and dispensed with his turban.One day, at the age of 21, he came home to learn that his marriage had been arranged. My mother would soon arrive from India. She was light-skinned and from an equal family. They had not met before. It was to be a marriage among migrants, a bet on two outsiders finding their own solace.Success meant full adaptation at every important milestone. Unable to find a venue willing to host his religious wedding ceremony, he picked a pub instead, clearing the smell of booze with incense and convincing a priest to bring the holy book to a bar.With the rise and fall of the British car industry – the golden age of the 60s, the slump of the late 70s – career trajectories changed. There were promotions in our family. My father became a foreman, another uncle a supervisor, and there was movement within isions from the assembly line to managerial work.However, in these turbulent political times, my father’s interior life was largely inaccessible to the rest of us. My family emulated the three-tiered structure of British life: the home, the factory and the pub. These domains rarely overlapped – except on a warm July day in 1981, when Charles and Diana got married. My father had the day off, and aunts and uncles came to our house to watch the wedding, wearing their finest clothes, as if they were invited. It was a rare day when we seemed to belong to the same reality as our English neighbours.As the family became confidently middle class, my father’s turban reappeared. By the early 90s, he and his brother ran a grocery store. Because this was a family business, it became a family space, and I got to see my father interact with the rest of British society. It was mandatory for the children to spend a few hours in the store after school, stacking shelves, counting produce and ordering inventory.It all seemed to be going well until one day, at the age of 13, I happened to be alone with my father at the store when a teenager kicked the door open. His name was Danny. He was a council estate kid who wore a gold chain around his neck. He scouted the lanes, picking up a few items here and there as my father tried to keep an eye on him he had stolen before.Danny placed two packets of Opal Fruits on the counter and waited for my father to ring him up. “Take out the chocolates from your jacket pocket,” I remember my father saying, his voice calm but firm. “Fuck off, Paki,” Danny said before he ran out.The two of them brawled outside the shop. My father’s turban unravelled. I watched him fall to the ground and wished he would pick himself up, fast, before someone from my school saw him. Danny bolted in the direction of the estates. My father returned to the shop with a Cadbury’s bar in his hand, reclaimed from Danny. The chocolate had broken in two it was damaged goods. He ate one piece and then he went to the back of the shop to fix his turban. Soon the front door opened and we moved on to serving the next customer. We never once talked about the incident.We never spoke about race because we believed that class could erase our exclusion. We couldn’t change the colour of our skin, so we worked harder to become more prosperous.Strategies for class mobility were my father’s area of expertise. He turned up for every national and local election. He signed my sister and me up for the Labour party, asking us to pay our dues because a day would come when we would need representation. He lauded the British for their industriousness, marvelled at how small they were in size as a country and how large an empire they had ruled. Nevertheless, every time a newly elected British prime minister visited India, he would register his usual lament: “Will they ever apologise for their colonial crimes?” English pride and Indian nationalism went hand in hand: although he was a “midnight’s child”, born in 1947 in a free India, the British loomed large in his psyche. They were the masters, and they had taught him that power itself was a value, worthy of respect, even if it was grudging.Surely this was ordinary interplay between real and imaginary homes, the kinds of conversations that took place in every immigrant household. Nearly all my uncles at some point considered returning to India, but none had followed through.I had expected my father to be similarly pragmatic. I didn’t realise his attachment to his original home was so deep that one day he would be willing to accept a more painful death over remaining in England.Fifty years after his first arrival, three months before he died, he was back at Heathrow airport, bidding farewell to England.Coming out to my parents in Punjabi had proved nearly impossible. The words for it didn’t exist in the language. Resorting to English would make my sexuality feel like a western construct. When parts of myself were translated into different tongues, a wedge seemed to be driven through me.But duality was not unfamiliar to my father. It had seeped into his parenting. He would moralise in Punjabi and transact in English. He didn’t care how I chose to live my life in the west. He was mostly concerned about India, that nothing would come in the way of its enduring pull. It was only after his stage-four cancer diagnosis that something changed: each time I left the UK or spoke to him on the phone, my father would say in English and in Punjabi, “Be happy,” and, “Don’t worry.”Acceptance was not immediate. For a short while my father thought my partner, Muneer, a law professor, had all the markings of a Muslim terrorist. An avid newspaper reader, he started saving specific types of articles. One such clipping traced the journey of a UK-born, Ivy League-educated Muslim man involved in a terrorist plot.I told my father I was sure of one thing: Muneer was not into blowing himself up. A few months later he mentioned another story he had read, about a same-sex couple becoming parents. “You should have a child,” he said to me one day, as I accompanied him to his chemotherapy treatment. “In fact, have twins, since you are starting so late.”In 2012 my father asked me to visit India and to bring Muneer with me. I resisted London would be easier, given India’s restrictive visa policy for anyone with ancestral ties to Pakistan. He pushed, and we relented, aware that we were being asked to demonstrate how this relationship would not hinder my heritage.We waited for several months, but the visa never arrived. I called my father to give him the bad news. “With your education, I’m confident the two of you can find a way,” he said, taunting us.We arrived late on a warm, humid afternoon, and my parents were standing at the door. I watched nervously as they hugged Muneer. My father’s face lit up as he heard Muneer speak in Hindustani. They hugged again.The next morning, over breakfast, my father pointed in the direction of the Wagah border, about 100km from the village. In good times, one can take a taxi from Amritsar to Lahore. He asked Muneer if he would be willing to meet a few people, to talk about his work and share his impressions of Punjab. So far our visit had been an intensely private affair and I wanted to keep it that way.But here was my father, living his true life, and it proved hard not to respond to that. Over the years, he had become an important powerbroker, collaborating with local politicians and businesses to mobilise investments from the Punjabi diaspora.We found ourselves walking into a cantonment in Nawanshahr, dotted with offices once occupied by the British army and civil services. Unbeknown to Muneer and me, in one of the offices, 10 journalists and three TV crews were waiting. At the front of the room, a long table was arranged with four chairs.We watched more press pour into the room. My father tapped the table. The room fell silent. He turned to his right and introduced Muneer – professor of law, expert in immigration and first-time visitor to Punjab – kicking off the press conference. The local press rarely had a chance to interview someone with roots in Pakistan. They dwelled on what it felt like to be a visitor in Punjab, and how different or similar it was to Pakistan. I watched Muneer shuffle in his chair, clear his throat and answer in Hindi, bending the language, reverting to English and occasionally turning to me for help finishing his sentences. He’s an American, I wanted to say. But that would have been lost on the press. To them he was a Pakistani, both foreign and familiar.“These kids need to see peace in their lives,” my father interjected. The message seemed intended for the local policymakers.The day we left, he handed us a binder full of clippings from the local newspapers. “You are always welcome here,” he said to Muneer.A week before his death, in his hazy state, my father told me about a box in his closet he wanted me to have. I took it as an invitation and walked straight to his bedroom. I found an old cardboard box on the bottom shelf, covered in a layer of dust.“Dad, these are old registries,” I said. Engraved on the first page was the face of King George VI, the pink lips and bright eyes of the last emperor of India. Below, in thick black ink, Urdu script ran in long symmetrical lines, documenting debts owed to the family and proof of land ownership.Underneath the registries, I discovered a letter in Urdu. “America 1933,” it said on the top left corner. I asked Nina, a family maid from Bihar, to go around the village and find me an Urdu reader. But such was the legacy of partition: there was no one left in our Punjabi village who spoke the language of my great-grandfather.From the rooftop, I could see the fertile fields and the dark soil, the kind of topography my great-grandfather Puran Singh would have encountered in the Sacramento Valley. Farming methods developed in the fields of Punjab were in demand in California’s newly arable land. These immigrants could harvest in the scorching heat. They also knew fruit-picking needed delicate hands. It was easy to bruise a peach.The money they saved arrived back in India through the imperial postal system. Letters carried promises of families reuniting and making the US their home. But the California Alien Land Law of 1913 prohibited immigrants from buying land. A 1920 report from the California State Board of Control described Indian workers as unfit for association with American people. Three years later, the supreme court ruled that Indian men were ineligible for naturalised citizenship.In 1946, Congress passed legislation that made the first wave of Indian immigrants eligible for US citizenship. Had he been alive, Puran Singh would have shared in the triumph, but also grieved its terms. The India League of America had argued that Indians belonged in the US because they “are anthropologically of Caucasian race”.Erasing a part of yourself would be the only kind of progress available time and time again.In our house in the US, we talk about the house in India. I tell my four-year-old son about the peacocks that visit our rooftop in Khanpur, and how one day we will make oil lamps and leave them by the wooden door. Hundreds of people will visit him and they will send him any animal he wants. It’s that kind of place: beautiful, but deeply unequal.“Who lives there?” my son asks. I’m thrown off by the question, unsure how to explain the hold of an uninhabited place.In the middle of my night, text messages arrive from people in the village. The banisters have cracked. The village temple needs a generous donation. Nina’s back is crooked and she might return to Bihar.My mother tells me there is a special kind of blessing my son can only receive if he visits the land of his ancestors.We make plans to visit as a family but we falter. Muneer would have to submit his passport for an unknown period and wait for the Indian authorities to respond. Also buried in my resistance is not wanting to submit a visa application for my son. The application will ask if one of his parents or grandparents was born in Pakistan, perhaps prompting the Indian authorities to treat him as a Pakistani American, marking him for ever and limiting his access to India. Or perhaps realising that he has two fathers, they will be inclined to recognise only me, his Indian American father. Our visit is either a process of denying who we are, or comes at the risk of banishment.My mother often says I’ve changed the course of my son’s life by hyphenating his last name, by adding Ahmad, a Muslim surname, to Dhillon, a Sikh surname. The first time she saw my son’s passport she didn’t speak to me for days. “They won’t like it in India, they won’t like it in America,” she said.‘I always want you to be well,” Puran Singh wrote in a letter to his son, penned from a rural farm near Yuba City in June 1933. “This is to say I wrote you three letters. Did you get them? If you did why have you not replied?“You may have heard, I hurt my leg so I am walking with a stick. I think in five to six months I will return home. These days work is very slow. It’s only hand to mouth.“How are the people in the village? Send me an update on them. I want to know if everyone is healthy.“If Sham Singh had not tried to come to America it would have been better.

As the PM has said many times, she is a committed unionist that’s a key fact in where we’ve ended up.”Checks at ports could also breach an amendment to the government’s customs bill, currently making its way through the Lords, which would rule out a customs border in the Irish Sea.Michel Barnier has asked the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, for data on freight movements. Belfast sources say there have been delays in producing the data because ferry companies do not register the final destination of freight and some containers could have multiple destinations.Seamus Leheny, the head of the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said many members used the route between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales because it was the shortest crossing. Data from the Central Statistics Office in Ireland shows that 1.1m trucks and unaccompanied containers arrive in Dublin every year but the data does not include how many journeys each lorry makes a year.While Theresa May opposes EU checks in British ports, recent reports suggest there is a loosening of opposition among Brexiters. The Brexit-supporting European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, will reportedly support the proposal in a Brexit blueprint due to be published this week, believing it will break “the logjam” and show willingness to Brussels.One source said: “The ERG don’t care enough about Northern Ireland. But they are now very worried about a ‘no deal’ and timerunning out. They don’t want Ireland scuppering everything.”They argue that EU officials checking trucks in British ports is no different in principle to having French police in St Pancras station in London checking passports of Eurostar passengers, or British border force operations in Calais.The proposal has not been tabled officially in Brussels but Barnier confirmed it was one of the options under consideration.In a transcript of his conversation with the Brexit select committee in Brussels, he told MPs that plant and animal checks could be done “on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland”.Under the proposal, ports such as Liverpool, Holyhead and Fishguard would have red and green lanes for freight. All trucks carrying food and animal produce would be required to have checks under EU law and, along with any trucks without correct paperwork or deemed to be potential smuggling suspects, would be directed into the red channel to be examined.Trusted traders with non-agrifood loads assessed not to be a smuggling risk would pass through the green channel unchecked provided customs declarations forms, which can be completely electronically, were submitted in advance.Animals and agrifood that go from Britain to Northern Ireland, and to Ireland, are already checked to protect against the spread of diseases such as BSE and TB and implementing this for other goods would just be an extension of the current system, said one source close to negotiations.Leheny said having checks at British ports would protect the island of Ireland and could even boost Northern Ireland’s exports.“If poultry and beef coming in from Britain to Northern Ireland passed through the red channel it could be enough to satisfy the EU,” said. “The meat exporters would also be happy because it would mean they could send their products to GB and across the border into Ireland and the EU.“They would still have both markets. We have always said if we are going to do checks, we should do them when the wheels aren’t turning, when the trucks are in the port or at sea, that way there is no interruption in the flow of traffic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1ef0a4507f03307071b948fb73d80bc5d97535/0_0_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d076b93a68c45ba2aa1a5e9cfa1f0944","title":"brexit progress is really just paving way for theresa may to blink","story":"For all Michel Barnier’s warm words, nothing much has changed in a rather one-sided staring matchAs the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, arrived in Strasbourg to brief MEPs on talks with the UK and take in Jean-Claude Juncker’s state of the union speech in the European parliament, he will have been satisfied by the narrative in the British media.His suggestion on Monday at a conference in Bled, Slovenia, that if both sides are “realistic” an agreement on the terms of the UK’s exit could be reached by November will be familiar to any vaguely tuned-in Brexit watcher. He wants a deal on the withdrawal agreement this autumn on the issues of citizens rights, the orce bill and, crucially, Northern Ireland, among others, and some pragmatism from the British will enable it. No surprises there.But the comments did set some useful hares running. The jittery pound did one of its now regular jumps in value to the dollar. The former chief secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands, a Tory MP, tweeted his satisfaction that the EU was waking up to the economic importance of the UK to the continent. While former Tory whip, Michael Fabricant, suggested: “As we approach the deadline, the #EU is starting to bend.”This is all good comfort food for Theresa May as she approaches the Tory party conference, and the most difficult months of her difficult premiership. It sounds like progress.Downing Street, as with the currency traders, will gratefully jump on it. But it is also useful to Barnier, who in Bled laid off from his recent bashing of the Chequers proposals. As miscast as the Tory MPs’ reading of the situation is today, they are playing their role in Brussels’ attempt to prepare the ground for May to blink in what is in reality a rather one-sided staring match.Barnier has already had his say on Chequers. The EU’s member states will not accept its central planks: a facilitated customs arrangement that will allow the UK to have an independent trade policy, while enjoying the benefits of frictionless trade, and a common rule book on agricultural and industrial goods. But he does like much of what else is in Chequers, in particular on foreign policy and security, with the UK having softened its position on the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.And he likes that the British government actually now has a policy. The prime minister did what she had promised she would do, and made a decision. It cost her two cabinet ministers. And she has survived. She is going to have to make some more big decisions in the coming weeks, and she has now shown that she is willing to do so.The EU isn’t blinking. So, does the prime minister move towards the Norway-plus option, with full alignment, not only on goods but also services, and accept that the UK needs a customs union? Does she retreat from the EU orbit, accept a Canada-style free trade deal, to please the Brexiters, and work with Brussels to take the sting out of their solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, in which a border is effectively drawn in the Irish sea?In Brussels, there is considerable doubt that May has the ability to deliver on either of these options. They could offer to fudge it sufficiently that she doesn’t necessarily have to make that call, should that be the only way the prime minister can see a way forward. The political declaration on the future is a non-binding document that comes along with main deal. Its only job, as far as Brussels is concerned, is to help May deliver the withdrawal agreement. Whatever the future will bring, and the nature of the majority May is seeking to fashion in the Commons, no one in Brussels is expecting anything from the UK government until after Tory party conference.The EU summit in Salzburg next week will not substantially change anything either for all the talk of a change in Barnier’s mandate from the EU27. Observers should merely expect another attempt to engineer a jump in the pound and inflate some optimism in the British debate. The crunch decisions will have to be made soon enough, after all.Someone needs to blink, or a no deal beckons. The EU is pretty certain it won’t be them. If the prime minister is going to do so, she needs to be in Downing Street to do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e655d0f32eccba0e9280584c88bd9b69f92b82/0_62_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb4abe7c8c5a4f2f6e1084c62648b07b","title":"brexit weekly briefing tories continue tear themselves apart","story":"Irish border issue still looms large, with Barnier irritated at the UK’s failure to progressWelcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing: bringing you the top stories of the past week in Brexitland, arranged in an order that might – hopefully – help you make some sense of them.If you’d like to receive the briefing as a weekly email, please sign up here.

We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a  supporter. Thank you.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, reckons there’s a “realistic” chance of sealing a Brexit deal with the UK within the next two months, in time for a special summit in November that should be announced at meeting in Salzburg next week.That could work because the deal will cover only the orce – the financial settlement, citizens’ rights and the Irish border. The tricky bits, such as the future trade agreement, will only be outlined in a political declaration, with details to be thrashed out in the two-year transition period. So far, so good.But not so fast. Although a fudge-flavoured declaration may get past a ided UK parliament, some EU countries still want the key principles nailed down, so there’s no chance of the UK cherrypicking the best bits of the single market.And the plan depends on finding a solution to the intractable Irish border problem by the EU’s October summit. Barnier was “disappointed and irritated” by the UK’s failure to make progress on this No 10’s refusal to countenance one possible solution – having EU officials stationed in British ports serving Ireland – won’t help.Although, contrary to reports, the EU likes some bits of Theresa May’s Chequers plan for Brexit, its key trade components, on customs and common standards, are non-starters, whatever the UK may say. At some point, Britain is still going to have to choose between a Canada-style free trade deal or a more Norwegian arrangement. And when that choice comes, it will be painful.Meanwhile, the Tory party is still tearing itself apart over the kind of Brexit it wants and Boris Johnson’s manoeuvres, true believers in the European Research Group (ERG) are going over the top, union members back a second referendum, Labour is (kind of) keeping its powder dry, and whatever happens, the prime minister has to get the Brexit deal through parliament.And the home secretary is prepared for civil disorder in the event of a no deal.This isn’t really comment, but I wholeheartedly recommend it for a quick but comprehensive guide to where, Brexitwise, we all stand – and might end up – with just 200 days to go.Rafael Behr, meanwhile, reckons remainers’ biggest challenge is not so much winning over Brexiters but getting people to re-engage with an issue they would rather just went away:And Polly Toynbee says Brexiteers will slash the state in a fantasy vision of massive unfunded tax cuts and a free market free-for-all, and Theresa May must call their bluff:Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg seek a deep diminishing of the state, with a low-tax retreat from public to private provision of services. That has been at the heart of true Brexitry from the start, the loathing of Brussels only an extension of deep-rooted anti-statism. When the Brexiteers call for no deal, on WTO rules, they want a wide-open free trading free-for-all, as their high priest of the free market, Prof Patrick Minford, has spelled out. Their vision of Britain’s future has no barriers, no regulations, cheap goods, and food from everywhere regardless of chemicals or hormones, regardless of the destruction of our farming and manufacturing … Brexit is a belief, a culture, a tic, an instinct, racist in many of its manifestations. Brexiteers dared not print a manifesto that exposed them in all their political nakedness.

I personally do not really mind who the prime minister of the United Kingdom is as long as they do good old-fashioned liberal things that I agree with. So this debate, forgive me, is not about who is prime minister of this country. It’s about what the policy ought to be ... I want to talk about the future of the United Kingdom. I’m not much interested in who the prime minister is.Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary who has emerged as the most vocal critic of Chequers in the Conservative party and who was at the event, refused to say what would happen if May refused to change her policy. And Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Brexiters could oppose Chequers without having to bring down May. He explained:People are missing the change, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The vote on the legislation will not be a vote of confidence. So we can vote down the bad Chequers proposals on Monday and support the government in a vote of confidence on Tuesday. They are clear, separate things. And trying to align them is, I think, a mistake. So we can carry on supporting the prime minister, but we can oppose this policy until it’s changed or collapses. It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?According to Harry Cole in today’s Sun, the ERG solution would involve roaming tax inspectors. Cole reports in his story:Flying squads of tax inspectors would roam Northern Ireland after Brexit under an alternative plan drawn up by senior Tories to “destroy Chequers”, The Sun can reveal.Arch-Eurosceptics believe a hard border with the EU could be avoided by “Inland Clearance” that would see goods made for export subject to spot checks from officials in factories and at arrival destinations.You made quite rightly the political objection that it turns us into a ‘vassal state’. But it seems to me there is also this particular economic objection that in abandoning our seat around the table in Brussels and continuing to accept the single market legislation ... we will be exposing UK businesses, manufacturers, entrepreneurs, innovators, to whatsoever rules the EU decides in the future to devise, even though those rules may well be inimical to the interests of UK innovation. That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo.And the ’s Micheal Deacon has been reading the pocket version of the Economists for Free Trade report. At least this Brexiter experience (unlike others - see 12.01pm) can’t be accused of long-windedness.Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton has been reading the Economists for Free Trade report, and he points out that it argues that, whether Brexit leads to the pound risingor falling in value, either way, it will be good for the UK.And the UK Trade Policy Observatory, an academicthinktank partnership, has tweeted a link to a blog written last month contesting the Economists for Free Trade arguments.Earlier, at 11.20am, I posted links to Twitter threads from two experts contesting the Economists for Free Trade claims.Here is the full Economists for Free Trade report (pdf). And here is the pocket guide (pdf).Here are some more critique from experts.From Sam Lowe, a trade specialist at the Centre for European Reform - a thread starting hereAnd the ’s Anna Isaac asks a pertinent question about the Carney announcement.Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, is not happy about Mark Carney getting his term as governor of the Bank of England extended.Here is what Philip Hammond told MPs about Mark Carney.I can now announce to the House that I have been discussing with the governor his ability to be able to serve a little longer in post in order to ensure continuity through what could be quite a turbulent period for our economy in the early summer of 2019. And I can tell the House today that the governor has agreed, despite various personal pressures to conclude his term in June, that he will continue until the end of January 2020 in order to help support continuity in our economy during this period.And Philip Hammond has just told MPs that Mark Carney will stay on as governor of the Bank of England - but only for another seven months.Until today Carney had been due to leave in June 2019.I’m back in the office now that the Economists for Free Trade meeting is over. I will post a summary soon.While I’ve been there, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been taking questions in the Commons. As my colleague Peter Walker points out, he sounded mildly sceptical about the case for maintaining the freeze on fuel duty.The MPs groan and protest. The questioner does not get a proper answer.God bless you, says Steve Baker. You are asking the question everyone wants to ask. But this is not about personalities this is about policy.Jacob Rees-Mogg says he will vote against Chequers.Asked for a contribution, Boris Johnson says he agrees with Baker and Rees-Mogg.Q: But what happens if May refuses to budge?Johnson refuses to address this.Rees-Mogg says the vote on the legislation won’t be a vote of confidence. They can vote down Chequers on the Monday and back the PM in a vote of confidence on the Tuesday.Baker says people in the room know that the person who has done the numbers is him. There are nearly 80 Tories who will vote against Chequers.Iain Duncan Smith chips in too. He disputes the claim that this is an alternative.(MPs are fond of the sound of their own voices. And Brexiters perhaps more than others. This is sounding less like a press conference, and more like a rally.)Sir Bill Cash intervenes. He says, as chair of the European scrutiny committee, he know that these common rulebook laws can be changed behind closed doors. It is “completely undemocratic”, he says. Chequers would make things worse because the UK would be bound by these rules without having a say.Martin Howe intervenes. He says an ECJ ruling recently said that gene editing was covered by laws on GM food.That shows how ECJ intervene with an important UK industry.Boris Johnson intervenes. He says he wants to ask Patrick Minford what he feels about the danger of exposing British businesses to the risk of having to comply with EU rules in future.Minford says Johnson is right to warn about this risk. It is “vassalage” not just economically but politically.Rees-Mogg addresses a question about why the Brexiters favour a trade deal when trading on WTO terms would be so good.First, he says, the difference between WTO and a trade deal are not that big.And, second, he says, other issues come into play. It might be worth accepting “very minor differences” for the sake of a trade deal that involves leaving on good terms.Here are some of the other Tory Brexiters in the room, as well as those already mentioned: Peter Bone, Iain Duncan Smith, Peter Lilley, Andrew Bridgen, Owen Paterson, Stewart Jackson and Marcus Fysh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed5d20f18eb258bde602410308255790895bbcbd/0_354_5111_3067/master/5111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0fac9807b3e5d1d49d11d8b7a4af8db","title":"british women live shorter lives than most other europeans","story":"Spanish women live the longest, with UK longevity ranked 17th out of 28 EU nations, according to Public Health England’s annual health profileWomen in the UK are living shorter lives on average than most of their counterparts in Europe, according to an analysis by Public Health England.Spanish women have the highest life expectancy in Europe at birth, at 86.3 years in 2016. The average for the UK is 83, taking 17th place out of 28 EU nations. Men in the UK do better, in 10th place and with above-average life expectancy of 79.4, but men in Italy, the leading nation, can expect to live to 81.The data, from Eurostat, is for the UK as a whole rather than its constituent countries, but is being published by PHE as part of its annual Health Profile for England. Data from the Global Burden of Disease study on premature death shows a similar picture.“We are in the middle of the pack and we would like to be at the top. There is no reason why we shouldn’t be as healthy as anywhere in Europe,” said Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE.“It is certainly of concern that we have worse outcomes than other European countries,” he added. “We tend to do badly in men with respiratory disease and in women with cancer, especially breast cancer. It is a sign of the numbers developing disease.”Many of the causes of chronic, long-term diseases in the UK which shorten lives are preventable. Obesity is causing a big surge in the numbers of people developing type 2 diabetes. The report shows the numbers with diabetes are expected to rise swiftly, from just under four million last year to nearly five million in 2035. Along with alcohol, obesity is also one of the factors behind the rise in breast cancer. Apart from the human cost, the bill for the NHS will be huge.Most of the strategies to reduce obesity are aimed at children. “In many ways it is easier to intervene,” said Newton. “We have a duty of care for children. But it is equally important that adults are enabled to eat a better diet.”There is strong policy support for childhood obesity programmes, he said, such as the sugary drinks tax, curbs on advertising junk food to children and pressuring food companies to cut the sugar, salt and calories in their products. There is little directed specifically at adults. However, said Newton, “nearly all of the measures will also improve adult obesity. Effectively we are taking calories out of the national diet,” he said.The report also shows that healthy life expectancy – the number of years people live before they begin to suffer from illnesses – has not much changed in recent years. Women in 2014-16 were spending nearly 20 years of their life in poor health (19.3 years), while men spent just over 16 years in poor health, according to data from the Office for National Statistics included in the report.Long-term conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cancers underlie some of these problems.The Alzheimer’s Society said that one million people will be living with dementia by 2021 and that the disease has not had the attention it deserves.“We have stressed for a long time that dementia was set to be the 21st century’s biggest killer – it has already become so, and what is the stark reality for women is now also set to be the case for men,” said Sally Copley, director of policy. “What makes this more sobering is that it is the only leading cause of death that we can’t cure, prevent or even slow down, showing the critical need to tackle the dementia crisis.”Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said there were genetic and socioeconomic reasons people were developing long-term conditions affecting their health, “but there remains a clear connection between the quality of our patients’ lifestyle and their overall health”. That included poor diet and lack of exercise.“GPs are acutely aware of these dangers, which is why we will always try to take into account the physical, psychological and social aspects of the person sitting in front of us, including how their lifestyle might be affecting their health and the ways in which they can work to improve it. Often simple lifestyle changes can have a big impact on long-term health and wellbeing,” she said.“With many patients coming to see their doctor with more than one problem, however, finding time to properly assess someone’s lifestyle can be difficult within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.”Of great concern, however, are the social and economic inequalities in health. “People in wealthier parts of the country enjoy 19 more years of good health than in poorer parts of the country,” he said. “They live nine years longer – for men – and seven years longer for women. These are unacceptable variations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7bc44392161b7d099da11bf6a76683177d44f06/158_0_4297_2579/master/4297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7b608193837704ffefb2154e03a0ed","title":"england v india fifth test day five live","story":"58th over: India 231-5 (Rahul 131, Pant 49) Root beats Pant with a delivery that kicked out of the rough, but no cigar. 58th over: India 230-5 (Rahul 131, Pant 48) A moment of carelessness from Pant, who slashes at a wide delivery from Stokes but gets nowhere near it. “Anderson has barely bowled today and there are two spinners in the team,” notes Roy Allen. “Why is Root bowling?” Well, the batsmen seemed comfortable with the other spinners, so why not roll the dice?58th over: India 228-5 (Rahul 130, Pant 47) The variable bounce seems to be troubling Bairstow more than the batsmen, and Root’s final delivery stays low, shoots between his legs and disappears for four byes. 57th over: India 223-5 (Rahul 129, Pant 47) There’s a promising sound as the ball passes Pant’s bat and Bairstow es to his right to take it, but it’s false hope: the bat hit the ground, and the ball hit nothing. 56th over: India 221-5 (Rahul 128, Pant 46) Root takes his head out of hands. Which of his bowlers can disturb this settled partnership? Why, Root himself, of course! There’s one particularly good delivery, a legbreak that shoots out of the rough.

That’s a 100 partnership, in 109 deliveries.54th over: India 213-5 (Rahul 128, Pant 38) That is a fine, fine shot from Pant, who shuffles down the pitch and drives Moeen beautifully through the covers on the half-volley. A single later, Rahul ends the over with a thunderwhump that whistles past mid-off and streaks to the rope. Two very comfortable and capable batsmen in the middle at the moment.53rd over: India 204-5 (Rahul 124, Pant 33) Pant flexes his muscles again, stepping back to slash the ball away for four.52nd over: India 198-5 (Rahul 123, Pant 28) Moeen finds the edge of Pant’s bat, but the ball isn’t remotely inclined to stay in the air long enough to be caught. It obviously enjoys this, and from the final ball of the over it refuses to bounce, flying low to Bairstow’s toes.51st over: India 195-5 (Rahul 121, Pant 27) Peter Salmon sounds the Ashes klaxon. “Here is the squad for Australia’s test match against Pakistan,” he writes. “Speaking as an Australian, who are these people?!”That squad in full: Tim Paine (capt, wk), Ashton Agar, Brendan Doggett, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Jon Holland, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Michael Neser, Matthew Renshaw, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc.50th over: India 192-5 (Rahul 119, Pant 26) A single single as Moeen keeps missing the significant rough and Pant calmly defends or leaves.49th over: India 191-5 (Rahul 118, Pant 26) Rashid gets the ball to turn hard out of the rough, but Pant works it away for a couple, and then pings the next over mid-off for four.48th over: India 182-5 (Rahul 117, Pant 18) It’s extremely quiet at the Oval, both in the crowd and on the field, as the batsmen take a few stress-free singles and a two, though Root does get a gentle round of applause for a decent stop at short midwicket.47th over: India 177-5 (Rahul 113, Pant 17) Rashid, having bowled the final over before lunch, keeps going and Pant cuts the final ball away for four.On Sky they are doing a review of the summer, and consensus is that it has been an extremely good one. That sun has shone, even when it didn’t there was hardly any rain, and in a succession of fine matches, and despite some obvious failings, England have tended to prevail. Still basking in the warm glow of nostalgic wonder cast by yesterday’s goings-on, the positivity is overflowing like bubbles from an enthusiastically-poured glass of Champagne, of which there will surely be many before the day’s out. Over the next 12 months the pressure will rise. Exactly a year from tomorrow the fifth and final Ashes Test gets under way at the Oval. The World Cup final is 10 months and three days away. The England team, now without Alastair Cook, retains some players who might be considering the timing of their own departures. Chances are that a year from now the talk will once again be of emotion and valediction, but only time will tell if the smiles will be quite so wide.Actually, before I go, here’s Tom Adam putting it better than I ever could.“Not quite what Lord Reith might have expected from the BBC’s Cricket Correspondent...“On the other hand, Piers Morgan’s absurd sense of self-importance deserves all the abuse it can get. I love the way he announces ‘We’ve had our differences’ as if he and Cookie were equals instead of (on the one hand) England’s most successful ever batsman and (on the other hand) an attention-seeking pipsqueaksleazebag, condemned to a life of desperately farting into the electronic ether and hoping someone notices.” 45th over: India 167-5 (Rahul 108, Pant 12) Effing hell it’s Adil Rashid! He gets a token over before lunch, his first of the innings and maybe his last in Test cricket. Pant survives an LBW appeal from behind the stumps, largely because the ball hit the bat and not his foot, and then fails to pick a googly that snakes under the bat. A good over from Rashid to end an entertaining session.“I’ve watched Hameed a few times for Lancs this season and the goodwill towards him is extraordinary,” says Phil Rhodes. “Everyone is willing him on and almost as gutted as he is when he’s out. He has been bowled leaving the ball four or five times this season which shows his judgement has gone a bit. It’s a big mental battle for him at the moment. He has unfurled a few glorious cover drives at times so we have seen glimpses of what’s still there. Get him to a sport psychologist.” Simon Burnton will be with you after lunch. Thanks for your company and emails throughout the summer. Bye!44th over: India 166-5 (Rahul 107, Pant 12) Rahul inside-edges Moeen wide of Cook at short leg, and then Pant swings a one-handed six to cow corner! Moeen has now bowled 71 overs in the series, only one fewer than Adil Rashid - even though Rashid has played five Tests to Moeen’s two.“Hi Rob,” says Steve Castle. “I attended the eventful Lancashire v Yorkshire match in July and witnessed the enigma that is Hameed. In the first innings he was bowled for a horrible ten-ball one - the one being a woefully miscued pull - and was informed by the grumpy Lancashire patrons that this was his fourth successive dismissal bowled leaving the ball. In the second knock, with Lancashire under pressure chasing a target, the Hameed of old returned with a flowing 31, with some delightful cuts and even one six! He looked on course for a big score until he gloved a snorter from Steve Patterson behind. He truly looked like two different batsman in the same match - it was bewildering yet endearing.”Is there an issue with him trying to be too attacking? I want him to score 412-ball 85s forever.43rd over: India 159-5 (Rahul 106, Pant 6) Stokes continues to bomb Rahul, who defends expertly off the back foot and then paddles round the corner for four. A single takes him to 106 - and more importantly to 66.67 bloody per cent. He looks such a classy player and it’s hard to fathom that he’s had such a poor series. “Hurricane Florence means that school is cancelled for the rest of the week, so I’m stuck at home with the kids,” says Mac Millings. “Do your fives of readers have any suggestions as to keeping them occupied so I don’t lose my bleedin’ mind?”Can’t you just give them 20 Marlboro and an iPad each?42nd over: India 154-5 (Rahul 101, Pant 6) “Hi Rob,” says Simon Ward. “At my first live day of Test cricket since day 2 of the Oval Test in 85. The train down from the north was 10 minutes, so I was delighted to see that five wickets hadn’t fallen by 11.15. If my employers are listening, I’m using the free wifi to keep up with email correspondence (which makes up 90 per cent of my job anyway). Major observation: reviews in real time are great, and Broad’s legs are longer than on the telly.”I’m pretty jealous. You were there in 1985? You were there to see Les Taylor’s last Test innings?41st over: India 152-5 (Rahul 101, Pant 4) Rahul plays an astonishing stroke, backing away to flat bat Stokes’s short ball over extra cover for six! “My word,” says Nasser Hussain. “This is a Test match isn’t it?” Not any more it isn’t. A pull round the corner for four takes Rahul to 97, and then he leathers another short ball through mid off to reach a blistering hundred from only 118 deliveries. Great stuff. 40th over: India 138-5 (Rahul 87, Pant 4) Rahul sweeps consecutive boundaries off Moeen, reverse then orthodox. The record for percentage of runs scored in a completed innings is 67.34 per cent, made by Charles Bannerman in the inaugural Test match. KL Rahul is currently on 63.04 per cent. Sod Jimmy going past Glenn McGrath this would be the definitive statgasm.“Your Mark Lathwell confessional (over 36) had me reflexively wincing in sympathy and self-recrimination. Rest assured, the regret is all the sharper when you were already old enough to know better. I hear that time and a winter of OBO coverage in Sri Lanka is a great healer ...”I still feel guilty, 14 years later, but not guilty enough to volunteer to get up at 4am for an ODI in Sri Lanka.39th over: India 129-5 (Rahul 78, Pant 4) Stokes continues to pepper the batsmen with short stuff. Rahul ignores a couple and then decides to take it on, hooking round the corner for a single. He might just be on course to break the oldest record in the book. “A regular lurking listener here,” says Abhinava Bhattacharyya. “Thought I’d cease the lurking and write in to the OBO after reading your estimation of Hameed. I completely agree. He played brilliantly when he came to India and looked every bit a distinctive batsman, at least in those conditions. He not only showed character and skill but displayed endurance and a rare courage. Since I’m Indian and don’t know much about the county game I can’t quite understand his average of 9 for Lancashire. I can only wonder if he’s receiving the right nurture and care that is required for precocious young cricketers that are struggling early in their career. While Trescothick did recover from the setback, not everyone may be able to. I would hope the selection panel and people from the England set up have been in his ear, in his year of miserable form.”I’m sure they have. Ed Smith is a smart, empathic chap. It is really odd though, especially as he has been scoring hundreds for the 2nd XI so he clearly hasn’t completely forgotten how to bat.38th over: India 128-5 (Rahul 77, Pant 4) KL Rahul survives another LBW appeal from Moeen after missing a sweep - but he injures his back in the process and needs treatment before he can continue. Rishabh Pant then gets off the mark with a jaunty whip for four.“I’m not sure that I’d agree with Helen Ward (11.13) that informing the public ahead of one’s retirement would necessarily be for the purpose of garnering adulation, nor that it would necessarily imply insecurity,” says Bill Hargreaves. “I would have thought that being transparent about one’s intentions, communicating clearly and in good time might be the mark of a person who is confident, authentic, respectful and seeking to be honest with those around them?” Agreed. I think in some cases it is largely motivated by narcissism but I doubt that was the case with Cook.37th over: India 121-5 (Rahul 74, Pant 0) “I will join you in the ‘my god, please let him get his mojo back’ Hameed crew, as it’s been desperately sad seeing his recent form,” says Guy Hornsby. “Last week Bumble was saying his hands were way too high to be right for quick bowling – which validates the point about him being good against spin – and that he hopes he can sort the issue out. The stumbling block, according to him, was that his dad won’t let anyone else really coach him. A shame, if true. He seems way too good to be a ‘whatever happened to’.”It sounds like Hameed could do with a month in the nets with Duncan Fletcher. Mind you, who couldn’t.Hanuma Vihari could have gone for a duck in the first innings this time he has. Ben Stokes was brought into the attack to deliver some rough stuff, and needed only three balls at Vihari to dismiss him. It was short of a length on a perfect line and Vihari gloved it through to Bairstow. That’s excellent bowling from Stokes.36th over: India 120-4 (Rahul 73, Vihari 0) “Afternoon, Smyth,” says Sean Clayton. “Interesting that you mentioned Banger’s autobiography (26th over). The 90s Somerset comparison that haunts me, in relation to Haseeb Hameed, is Mark Lathwell – young prodigy, brought in to the Test side quickly, didn’t take to the spotlight and his entire career fizzled by his mid-20s. Let’s hope HH (does anyone call him that?) actually likes cricket.”Yes, that’s an irresistible comparison – though actually the pattern of Hameed’s first-class career has been much closer to Trescothick’s. He and Lathwell are pretty different characters Lathwell was very shy by all accounts. I feel sad talking about Lathwell, who once threatened to sue me for describing him as having an “Andrex-soft temperament” in The Wisden Cricketer. It was such an arrogant throwaway line, the sort of thing you do when you’re young and life has yet to bite you. I really wish I could take that line back.Maybe Rahane was batting too beautifully for his own good. He has gone now after playing one shot too many. He tried to sweep Moeen and toe-ended it straight to Jennings at midwicket.35th over: India 119-3 (Rahul 72, Rahane 37) Rahane hits Curran for second consecutive boundaries, the first through square leg and the second past point. He and Rahul are batting beautifully now, and England are in serious danger of having to give Adil Rashid a bowl.34th over: India 111-3 (Rahul 70, Rahane 29) KL Rahul drives Moeen crisply for four. He has Test hundreds in Australia, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. England would look good on that list too.“Rob,” says Steve Hudson, “4-2-2-0 isn’t the formation favoured by football teams reduced to nine men - that’s 6-2-0-0. You’re getting it confused with the 4-2-2 wheel arrangement of the 1870 GNR Stirling-class locomotive, which is an understandable mistake.” 33rd over: India 101-3 (Rahul 62, Rahane 29) Curran has switched around the wicket, with two men on the drive for Rahane. A low full toss is put away for four, which brings up the hundred. That’s an admirable effort from Rahul and Rahane, who came together at two for three.I’m sure he’ll go on the Lions tour to the UAE. 32nd over: India 97-3 (Rahul 62, Rahane 25) Rahul charges Moeen, has an almighty heave ... and the ball travels about two inches before hitting him on the toe and stopping dead. He survives a big LBW appeal - and an England review - later in the over after getting in a rare mess.Rahul went back when he should have been forward and ended up square on as the ball grubbed to hit him on the pad. He was fractionally outside the line of stump. That’s another terrific decision from Kumar Dharmasena, who has had a sensational series.31st over: India 97-3 (Rahul 62, Rahane 25) Buttler saves four with a fine stop at short extra cover from a sweetly struck drive by Rahane. But he can do the square root of bugger all about a similar shot later in the over. That’s Rahane’s second boundary an affronted Curran responds by slamming a bouncer past his coupon.“Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Glad to hear Barney getting some love on here – my FB page is basically me linking to his articles. Had the gratifying experience of being at a Writers Festival recently and someone in the green room mentioned Ronay – writers piled in from everywhere as if we were discussing Joyce and Proust. We came up with the phrase ‘metaphor envy’, a state we have all suffered from while reading him out loud to our loved ones (as every single person there did).”Please don’t tell me he’s retiring as well.30th over: India 93-3 (Rahul 62, Rahane 21) Moeen replaces Broad. Rahane is beaten, playing a risky late cut, amd that’s about all. There’s a great chance for Moeen and Adil Rashid to pick up some cheap wickets today.29th over: India 90-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 19) Curran has started superbly, and he angles another fine delivery past the outside edge of Rahul. A maiden gives Curran figures of 4-2-2-0, the formation beloved of football teams when reduced to nine men.“It’d be lovely if you’re right about Hameed but it is easy to have no problems against spin if you’re already out before the first change comes on,” says Bob Miller. “Warne never got me out.”Well quite. But Hameed was comfortably England’s best batsman on last winter’s Lions tour of the Caribbean, and those Tests were played on some vile turners. Not that it matters – they won’t pick him, for obvious reasons.28th over: India 90-3 (Rahul 61, Rahane 19) It seems Stuart Broad is bowling with a broken rib, which registers pretty high on the Steve Waugh Playthroughtpainometer. Five from his latest over, which might be the last in this spell.“There’s a lot of wishful thinking surrounding Hameed at the moment,” says Phil Harrison. “But it seems to me that lad needs to be nowhere near an England tour at the moment. He needs a winter off, a new county and a complete reboot. Perhaps we’ll have another look in a year but not before. And the thing is, he’s got time - he’s still only 21. But trying to involve him now might be actively damaging.”I don’t see how going almost as a non-playing member can be damaging. I agree with the principle though, and was firmly against taking him to Australia last winter even before he got injured. I haven’t seen enough of his dismissals to know what the problem is. Maybe a winter off is a good idea, or a winter playing grade cricket in Australia. The main thing, as you say, is that he has loads of time on his side. I still think he’ll score 10,000 Test runs, though I’m not as sure as I was 18 months ago. 27th over: India 85-3 (Rahul 60, Rahane 15) Sam Curran replaces Jimmy Anderson, who will have to wait for Test wicket No564, and beats Rahane with consecutive leg-cutters. It feels like a wicket is coming.“Here’s a disturbing revelation for you,” says Richard O’Hagan. “About a month ago I had a dream that I was playing cricket with Barney Ronay. Odd, as I’m pretty sure I’ve never met the bloke.”Playing cricket? Bit vanilla. Wait till you hear about my Jimmy Ormond nightmares.26th over: India 84-3 (Rahul 59, Rahane 15) Broad beats Rahul with a couple of superb deliveries in the Boycottian corridor. The lights are on, which means the ball is nibbling around a bit. India have played well this morning, though, and with a lot of pride. It would much easier to throw it in and get ready to go home.“Are you suggesting we go on tour with the Hameed who has been dropped by Lancashire because he’s averaged 9 this season?” says Bob Miller. “Maybe he will be great but…”Yep, as a 17th man. His problems haven’t been against spin, which is all England will face in Sri Lanka, so I wouldn’t be worried if he had to come into the Test side at the last minute. More to the point, it would allow the captain, coaches and Ed Smith to chat to him, see if there are any technical faults and find out why he’s scoring millions of runs in 2nd XI cricket and none in 1st XI cricket. A change of scene would do him good, too, and might restart his career.He’s the most impressive young England batsman I’ve ever seen, a potential all-time great, so I would want to keep him in the loop as muchg as possible. I was reading Marcus Trescothick’s autobiography last night and he had three lost years at a similar age after an impressive debut season, so Hameed’s still got one in the bank. 25th over: India 83-3 (Rahul 58, Rahane 15) “Rahul Dravid also announced his retirement after playing his last Test,” says Argha. “Fitting way to go for the great man and apt as well considering the farewells that Sachin, Sourav and Kumble got. A microcosm of his entire career, that decision.”Yes, even down to the length of time it took him to make the decision.24th over: India 81-3 (Rahul 58, Rahane 13) Rahul reaches for a wide half volley from Broad, square driving it elegantly for four. “To Gary Naylor’s point, I think there is a fair amount of hindsight playing a part here,” says David Bartlett. “I was at the Oval on Sunday and the Indian players (and crowd!) were well up for it. Shami, Sharma and Bumrah bowled brilliantly, with Cook, Jennings and Ali playing and missing a number of times each over. It was only Cook’s grit that day (we scored at around two an over) and then some brilliant batting from Cook and Root yesterday which took the game away from India. As always in cricket, it could have all been very different!”23rd over: India 77-3 (Rahul 54, Rahane 13) The ball is starting to do a bit now, and Anderson beats both batsmen outside off stump in the course of a good over. “In case anyone asks for it, here’s the TMS link,” says Dave Langlois. “As I was saying to a friend after yesterday’s incredible events, one of the best things about such cricket heydays is the sheer quality of players, commentators, reporters and spectators, a unique mix. So congrats for your part in it all, especially that Ronay bloke. What a piece he wrote this morning.”22nd over: India 76-3 (Rahul 53, Rahane 13) Broad has a big LBW appeal against Rahane turned down by the immaculate Kumar Dharmasena. It swung a fair way and would have missed leg stump. Broad does have some strapping on his rib, which suggests bruising if not necessarily a crack.“In the warm after-glow of yesterday at the Oval, who do you think is the answer to who will open for England now?” asks Ben Powell. “Jennings seems to have support to go to Sri Lanka, which must be based on his reputation against spin rather than his current form. We have, looking at the fixtures, only six Tests between now and the start of the Ashes next summer, which feels not enough to settle on an opening pair that hasn’t been settled since 2012. On form this season (and the last few seasons), then Rory Burns looks the obvious candidate but is there something about him that doesn’t fit with the England set up? I’ve read Andy’s piece from last week and enjoyed the Spinal Tap references, but he doesn’t seem to have the answer either. Woe! Woe!”I think it will be Jennings and Burns in Sri Lanka. Nasser made a good case for James Vince in the Daily Mail. It partly depends whether England pick a team to win in Sri Lanka (which I would probably do) or look beyond that. I’d probably pick Burns and Vince with Hameed as the 17th man, though I don’t know enough about county cricket to really comment.21st over: India 65-3 (Rahul 52, Rahane 11) It’s been a quiet start to the day, with not much movement for Anderson and Broad. We might see Moeen Ali earlier than expected.“Just to expand slightly upon the point John Withington made at 10:24, it is interesting when sportspeople announce their impending retirement before their last matchcompetition,” says Helen Ward. “Surely the only reason they would do this, rather than announcing their retirement after their last game, is to garner adulation during their last game? It all makes me feel slightly queer that they’re clearly quite insecure. Alternatively, one could just not announce ANYTHING, and just quietly not be available for selection in future, but that would be a VERY old fashioned way of ending your career. Just a thought.”That’s what Mike Atherton did in 2001, and his is still my favourite retirement. I’d love to be so free of ego and full of dignity. But I know that, were I in a similar position, I’d announce it on social media a month in advance, with a humblebrag and a hashtag, before going on a farewell tour of the country.20th over: India 62-3 (Rahul 50, Rahane 10) In a surprising development, reports of Stuart Broad having a cracked rib were fake news. He starts with a maiden to Rahane, whose defensive approach suggests he’s of a mind to bat all day. He’s the only remaining batsman who could conceivably do that.“Morning Rob,” says Harry Lang. “There’s a snowflake’s chance in hell that Jimmy would even consider turning in for good. He’s a man in the prime of his career with the temperament of a wizened general, the arm of a under 20s javelin champion and the hair of a teenager. Plus we’ve already got a selection nightmare with our openers so legally, he can’t leave.”19th over: India 62-3 (Rahul 50, Rahane 10) James Anderson opens the bowling, needing one wicket to move ahead of Glenn McGrath. KL Rahul works him through midwicket for four to move to his first fifty of the series, a rapid affair from only 57 balls. Well played.“As I’m soon off to hospital for an operation I shall miss the live coverage today,” writes long-time OBOer John Starbuck, “so this is to wish the OBO team and England all the best, and thanks for a really good summer.”The same to you, John, and we hope it’s nothing serious. See you at 4am sharp for the first ODi in Sri Lanka.Corrections and clarifications department “If there is a convention that joke bowlers only appear when a match is petering out in a draw, it is a modern one,” says Neil Hickman. “In his book of the 1953 series, when England regained the Ashes at the Oval after 19 years, Trevor Bailey recounted that as England approached the 132 which they needed for victory, the Australian captain Lindsay Hassett brought himself and his vice-captain Arthur Morris on to bowl. The gesture was rather an acknowledgment that the match was effectively at an end.”Yes, fair point. See also Gower, David and others. I should have said that it’s not usually done when the bowling team are about to win the match.“I can’t quite believe I’m writing this, but were India simply too gentlemanly yesterday?” says Gary Naylor. “In the moment - and what a privilege is was to be there in the pavilion with friends - it made your heart soar to see the Indian players lining up to shake Alastair Cook by the hand (I think KL Rahul even removed his hat in deference), but I feel it’s taken the edge off the match. When Kohli went for a golden duck, I felt disappointed for him KL Rahul played some wonderful strokes, but with the air of a man playing a benefit game for an old adversary and I really, really want Ravindra Jadeja to score a maiden century today after his fantastic efforts with the ball and in the field yesterday. Sport’s not supposed to be like that, is it?”I take your point, though I wouldn’t criticise India for losing some edge in a dead rubber at the end of a mentally draining tour. I do think the whole Alastair Cook Benefit Match thing has been slightly excessive, but hype, image and standing ovations make the modern world go round. That said, it’s hard to begrudge Cook anything really.“Good morning Rob, and the OBO gang,” says Paul Brown. “What a delight it was to wake up this morning and realise what was essentially a perfect day of cricket (and le0’ts be honest here, sentiment too) actually happened! But I digress - I note it was mentioned on yesterday’s OBO that TMS did a segment covering Cook’s career which was soundtracked by Sia’s wonderful ‘Breathe Me’. I know you don’t get many requests for TMS links so thought I’d fire one across - do you have one for that piece? Regardless, a big thanks to yourself and all the OBOers for making this cracking summer of cricket that bit more entertaining and accessible from my desk at work.”“As it’s the last day of the last Test that Mr Cook will ever play,” begins Matthew Scanlon, “I wonder if Root will allow him one more over to get one more wicket and a final standing ovation?”I’m not sure he will, or that Cook would want it. The usual etiquette is that you only bring on joke bowlers when the match is petering out as a draw. Cook has always lived in fear of Mother Cricket, and even though he’s retiring I doubt he’ll want to offend her.An email “Has anyone considered the possibility that Jimmy might also hang his boots up after this match?” says John Withington. “Could he be waiting to pass McGrath and then just announce he’s finished? I suspect he’s not one to court the attention that Cook has had and might go quietly.”I can’t see it. He’s playing too well, and I think he’ll want at least one more Ashes. His last 200 Test wickets have come at an average of 20, and his last 100 at home – where he’ll face the Aussies next summer – have come at the absurd average of 16.Read all about itWho wants to feel warm and fuzzy? You’re in the right place.With the possible exception of a 24-pack of Tennent’s Super, there’s nothing like an end-of-term party to make us temporarily forget the state the world is in. In the next few hours, England will complete an unlikely 4-1 series win over India. Alastair Cook will get his last standing ovation as a Test cricketer, Jimmy Anderson will go past Glenn McGrath to become Test cricket’s most prolific fast bowler, and Stuart Broad may go past Kapil Dev to become the seventh leading wickettaker in Test history. For anyone with even the slightest emotional investment in the England cricket team, it’s going to be a day of benign, bittersweet emotion.It still won’t top the events of day four - an I-wasn’t-there day for most of us, yet one we’ll remember as if we were front and centre. Cook made a century in his final innings, Joe Root made his first hundred in over a year and Anderson and Broad reduced India to two for three. Oh, and Virat Kohli went for a golden duck. India recovered partially to 58 for three, but it’s hard to see them saving the game and impossible to see them winning it: they need a further 406 runs to do so. This match has already used up its quota of fairytales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a6102198a26de84c939517ba674ddb42529c62/0_213_3511_2107/master/3511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c15858474ed258f34a840d332f9a13","title":"gastronomic review norwich theatre royal curious directive","story":"It took years of experimenting for the Wright brothers to get airborne.

It was our last chance to travel before Evie, three, started school and Frankie, seven months, became, well … heavier and less portable.We looked at the weather (thunderstorms in Rio, sun in Lima) and booked a one-way flight to Peru with the vague aim of doing a U-shaped journey, ending in Brazil and taking in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. Our only must-sees were Machu Picchu and Iguazú Falls.We travelled light, filling two 70-litre rucksacks with clothes for us all. We hoped Evie would walk lots – which she did – but took a buggy, which frequently doubled as a luggage trolley.In mountainous Peru, the ladies in their beautiful embroidered waistcoats and skirts would shyly approach to look at the blonde oddities that were Frankie and Evie. I bought a length of cotton and played a one-sided game of charades to learn how to fold, tie and secure Frankie to my back (he ascended to the Sun Gate at Machu Picchu in this regal style).We ditched the idea of the Inca Trail, a four-day trek through the jungle, and instead took a scenic train ride and stayed in the nearest town, Aguas Calientes, queuing for a bus at 4am to get to the ancient site. The early start meant we saw the sun rise over the mountain, a humbling, unforgettable experience, and less crowded than we’d thought possible.In Copacabana, Bolivia, we got a taste of political unrest, with buses to La Paz cancelled because of road blockades. Rushing to get to a bus we’d heard was leaving, we got stuck in a procession of indigenous people shouting anti-government slogans and dragging a straw man, which they then strung up from a post in the street. Despite the high tension, every protestor had a smile and a few words for the kids. Buenos Aires has lots for families. We found ride-on robots in the Parque Tres de Febrero, and at the Museo de Los Niños, Evie tried out a variety of adult occupations – including plumber, with a giant toilet she could climb into to discover the journey of a poo.We took it fairly easy, doing only one or two things a day, and having long lunches and siestas where possible. Things that worked well were walking tours – we did excellent ones in Santiago, Buenos Aires and Montevideo – trips to see natural wonders, lakes, forests, mountains, Inca ruins, deserts. We went to a few museums and galleries, and discovered that some hotels in Peru let you use their pool and facilities for a small daily fee.We stayed in hostels, B\u0026ampBs (such as Casa Ko Cinco Robles, in Frutillar, Chile, where we ate breakfast overlooking an aquamarine lake, with an active volcano smoking in the distance), weird empty golf resorts (Hotel del Lago Golf \u0026amp Art Resort, Punta del Este, Uruguay), and finally Airbnbs, which were always the most difficult because of arranging to hand over the keys.We took the odd flight, and sometimes hired a car if we were staying in one area for a while (we did this in northern Argentina, driving through desert landscapes that felt like being on Mars in Chile for the Island of Chiloé and in Bariloche, the lake district of Argentina), but mostly we took buses everywhere. We even tried overnight journeys – hello fully reclining chairs – but they were difficult with a baby breastfeeding through the night.Neither Evie nor Frankie is a fussy eater, so food was never a problem. Restaurants opened late, so we had to adjust our routine for the kids, letting them nap late and stay up late most nights. There would always be something on a menu they’d eat, or sometimes we’d cook in a hostel. Frankie was weaning, so tried all manner of things off my plate – alpaca steak, guinea pig, ceviche (he hated it) and dulce de leche ice-cream (he loved it).Daily budget Around £70 for the family.One thing we would have done differently We’d have saved Bolivia for when the children were older and more capable of dealing with the altitude – they both got mildly sick and didn’t sleep well. John Kirkaldy, 70, travelled around the world for a yearI had a terrible gap year at 18, and it has haunted me ever since. And so, after a 45-year career as a university and college lecturer, I decided to try again in my retirement. I had £5,000 in savings, plus a state and various other pensions that would sustain frugal living.The year provided me with so many good experiences. As a historian, I was very moved by walking the battlefields of Gallipoli, Troy, the Spanish civil war and Vietnam. The French left the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, in west-central France, as it was when the Nazis killed nearly everybody living there in June 1944.I joined WWOOF (Willing Workers on Organic Farms)and worked on farms in France, Australia and the US.I did things I never thought I would: selling clothes in a boutique in India (I have zero fashion sense) while volunteering for the Sambhali Trust, a women’s sewing project in Jodphur and fronting a cacti stall in an Australian market as part of my wwoofing placement in Queensland’s Atherton Tablelands. Perhaps most surprising of all was becoming the world’s least-likely bungee jumper: overweight, risk-averse and a lifelong sufferer from vertigo, I jumped from the Kawarau Gorge suspension bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand. I was petrified, but I did it, and as the bus took us back to Queenstown and a celebratory beer, I felt that I had at last laid my gap year ghosts to rest.I encountered nothing but friendliness on my travels. People did not just point out directions, but often walked with me to show the way. Two people stand out: Chum Mey, one of only a dozen survivors of the notorious Khmer Rouge’s Tuol Sleng prison, where I met and talked to him through an interpreter – by the end of our 20-minute conversation, we were both in tears and Erwin, the Queensland smallholder I worked for, with whom I used to have heated discussions on philosophy while weeding.I stayed in hostels (no longer the spartan places of my youth) and cheap hotels. I also cut corners by sleeping on trains, planes and buses, and at stations and airports. The cornerstones of my travels were, however, friends’ and friends of friends’ homes.There were, of course, a few downsides. I didn’t take to Casablanca, as I was robbed there (only £20) and didn’t see any Ingrid Bergman lookalikes. I had a mild attack of cellulitis in Istanbul. I have two middle-aged children and five grandchildren, and leaving them was a wrench, but social media and modern technology made contact so much easier.Overall, the year showed that I could still hack it. It gave me confidence to deal with whatever life might throw at me over the next few years. I’m planning more, albeit shorter, trips. For older people thinking about a gap year, all I can say is: go for it.Daily budget Roughly £50, but it varied hugely.One thing I would have done differently Pack lighter (after my first week in France, I took half my stuff out and posted it back to England), and take a Swiss army knife.Travelling blind and partially deaf in Africa is challenging but rewarding, as most people simply want to help. I saw West Africa through the smell of spicy food, by hearing the sound of booming African music, tasting local food like fufu (a type of porridge), and by touching intricately carved masks. I experienced places with my cane and other senses, noticing the rough, uneven, often broken pavements and roads, huge steps and open drains, and was often guided by my couchsurfing hosts or one of the many kind locals I met.Each bus journey was exciting and adventurous. I felt all the bumps and bounces, the twists and turns – it gave me a picture of the country as I travelled. My hosts took me to bus stations, helped me buy tickets and told the conductors my stop. Many people I met were astonished that a blind guy was wandering their country alone, but once I explained how I “see the world”, they relaxed and we had fun. My first host, Charles, was Nigerian, but had been living in Accra, Ghana’s capital, long enough to know the layout. We listened to music in his room and he showed me some of the city’s historic places. I sampled local cuisine at a street cafe, eating fish and rice in spicy sauce while music boomed, people laughed and I sweated.I explored the old “slave” forts of Ghana’s south coast, feeling the bloody history in the stone walls, entering underground prisons and touching rusty cannons. Leaving the coast, I headed inland by bus, staying with lovely people in Kumasi, Sunyani, Tamale and Bolgatanga.I crossed the border to Burkina Faso with help from one of the guides from Ghana’s Paga Crocodile Pond and a border guard, who took me to a taxi. My most memorable experience of BF, apart from the basic lifestyle of bucket showers and mud-brick houses with corrugated metal roofs in 33C heat, was travelling by motorbike from the capital, Ouagadougou, in the dust and heat before hiking to Karfiguela Falls with local guides. In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire’s largest port, I listened to a fantastic jazz band, who swung African style.Then my travels became more difficult. It took more than 30 hours to reach the Guinea border from Abidjan, due to terrible roads and taking the wrong bus. After a comfortable night in Nzérékoré, I caught a shared taxi, 10 people in a seven-seater, and bumped, rattled and bounced all the way to Conakry, Guinea’s capital. After 30 hours of breakdowns, bumps and bounces, I arrived, late as usual, and my couchsurfing host had to rescue me from the military police who were being overly inquisitive about a blind guy roaming their city alone at 1am.The next morning, I was off to Guinea-Bissau, or so I thought. Unfortunately, not only did the shared taxi from Conakry to Bissau take more than six hours to find the necessary passengers, but also had the slowest driver in Africa, so we crawled into Bissau 50 hours after leaving Conakry. I stayed two nights with a friendly local, and explored the capital with his girlfriend, the market being the highlight, along with the harbour. When I finally arrived in Abéné, a south Senegalese beach town, a motorbike taxi whizzed me through tall bushes along a narrow lane and, 10 minutes later, I was at my friend’s place, drinking a cola and relaxing. I was in paradise.One thing I would have done differently Organising visas in advance would have saved a lot of time.Antonia Wilson was 30 when she travelled around the world for 10 months with her boyfriendIt was a wintery night in an east London pub. My brother had just returned from backpacking with epic tales.“I want to do that,” my boyfriend said. “Well, I’ve always wanted to do it,” I replied. A few weeks later we’d paid a deposit on flights to take us around the world for 10 months. Why then? Why not. Both of us had a career and a life in the UK, but it was the easiest decision. For the next year we saved while we mapped out a fantasy itinerary.The first flight was into Bangkok, the second out of Bali, giving us three months in between to explore south-east Asia overland. From a Cambodian long-tail boat powered by a car engine to a Chinese sleeper train for 25 hours, the more cramped or hairy the journey, the more vivid the memory. We rode mopeds in the Thai mountains to golden temples at dawn cycled in flip-flops across Vietnamese paddy fields for 12p beers climbed hundreds of steps as giant buddhas peered down at us from misty peaks all over the continent.Some moments of the trip felt wholly unreal – learning meditation with monks in Chiang Mai camping on a remote part of the Great Wall going to the Olympics in Rio standing underneath multiple rainbows at Iguazú Falls and in Mexico seeing a giant turtle in the wild for the first time, finally, after eight months away.We met old friends in new places, and made new friends all over. In Kuala Lumpur, we went to a rooftop pool party on a skyscraper with a couple of Malaysian comedians. And on the Gili islands a group of us tried local happy shakes on the beach, laughing for hours in the setting sun.Food played a major part too: a banh mi crawl in Hội An changed how I feel about sandwiches, for ever. On Colombia’s Caribbean coast, in Palomino, we waited while fish was caught, grilled and served with fried plantain. Peru topped the trip, with the zesty hit of ceviche in Lima, followed by hiking and biking to Machu Picchu, with mountains of guacamole at homestays along the way.The ultimate freedom came from campervanning: driving down the east coast of Australia, from the Daintree rainforest to the Canberra, losing ourselves in the ripples of the Whitsundays and a music festival in Byron Bay. And driving up the US west coast, feeling small in Yosemite’s deep forests, meeting cowboys on Death Valley’s salty plains, and waking up on a clifftop to the beautiful blues of Big Sur.As winter approached, it was Thanksgiving with family in New York and a slice of Iceland’s Golden Circle for my birthday. That crispy frost underfoot still didn’t prepare me for returning home – whatever that now meant. I found freelance work and my boyfriend lined up interviews. We stayed with family. It was tough.Not that being away was always rosy – long-term travel rarely is. Sometimes you get sick, tired or argue. Or all of your clothes get burned up in a tumble drier fire … but even that becomes a great story, eventually.Daily budget Around £50 each, but it varied by location (much less in Asia, more in Australia and the US).One thing I would have done differently Avoided the party on the first night in Cusco, Peru, 3,400 metres above sea level. Playing drinking games does not help altitude sickness.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

But did Max Otto von Stierlitz also inspire Putin?On 11 August 1973, a TV series was premiered throughout the Soviet Union that stopped the people in their tracks. Seventeen Moments of Spring was broadcast at 7.30pm over 12 consecutive nights, and this black-and-white second world war spy drama amassed an astonishing 50 to 80 million viewers per episode.For the 70 minutes of each show, city streets emptied, power station output surged and crime halted. Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, apparently changed the time of Central Committee meetings in order to catch every episode, so addicted was he to this slow-burning tale of a Soviet spy who infiltrates the Nazis in order to foil Operation Sunrise. That was the name given to the real-life secret negotiations between German and American intelligence, which aimed to forge a separate peace in the dying months of the war.“I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t aware of this series,” says Dina Newman, a journalist with the BBC World Service who was born in Moscow. “It came out when I was eight. It’s something I grew up with. Everybody at school talked about it. It quickly became part of our cultural experience, our folklore.”Like so much Soviet cultural output of the 70s, Seventeen Moments began as propaganda, part of the reforms initiated by Yuri Andropov, the recently appointed head of the KGB, to improve the security agency’s image. “Andropov felt the KGB’s authority had been damaged by Nikita Kruschev’s de-Stalinisation reforms,” says Newman. “He wanted to bring prestige and mystique back to the work of secret agents, in the hope of attracting educated, young recruits.”Andropov commissioned a series of books, songs and films to glorify the work of agents serving abroad. One was a piece of detective fiction by Yulian Semyonov. “Andropov had read Semyonov’s earlier novels,” says Jeremy Duns, an espionage expert and writer of spy novels. “He opened the KGB archives to him – including the classified files on Operation Sunrise.”Written in just two weeks, Seventeen Moments was commissioned as a TV series before it had even been published, under the guidance of one of the few female Soviet directors, Tatyana Lioznova. She was “assisted” by Andropov’s deputy and two KGB operatives brought in as “technical advisers”. Despite these incredibly restrictive conditions, Lioznova transformed propaganda into art, bringing in the brooding, handsome actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov to play the show’s double-agent hero, Max Otto von Stierlitz.Her other masterstroke was to commission the Soviet composer Mikael Tariverdiev to write the series’s score, which went way beyond atmospheric backdrop. “Tariverdiev’s music brings out Stierlitz’s inner life,” says musician and producer Stephen Coates. “One of the reasons it appealed to Soviet audiences at the time is its themes of loss and separation.”Coates has been a fan of Tariverdiev’s music since he first heard it in a Moscow cafe seven years ago. “Haunting, poignant and magical – it blew me away,” he says. “I got in contact with his widow, Vera, and we became friends.” Coates is now reissuing Tariverdiev’s works through the Earth Recordings label, and has organised a marathon screening of a subtitled Seventeen Moments at Pushkin House, London, this month.“One reason the series still stands up,” he says, “is that it retains an undercurrent of fear, of people being watched. In showing Hitler’s Germany, it was actually depicting Russia. People go about their business, but they’re never really free.”“Mikael wasn’t too thrilled about working on a spy series,” says Vera. “But he was intrigued by the possibilities. The plot required a continual musical theme. He agreed to work on the project only after finding the answer to that. He was introduced to an intelligence agent and discovered the details of his romantic inner life, which was nostalgia, the longing for a distant homeland.”There is a memorable six-minute scene in Seventeen Moments where Stierlitz and his wife meet in a German cafe. Not a word is spoken: there is just Tariverdiev’s mournful piano theme. The scene is based on real events. Soviet agents working abroad would be taken to see their loved ones, but couldn’t communicate with them. It was a demonstration of control: “We have her, she’s alive, stay loyal.”The scene, says Dina Newman, “went straight to the heart of the Soviet people. There is a coldness to the series. Much of its running time is taken up with wartime archive footage the Soviet army commandeered from the Germans. But its emotional side is carried by Tariverdiev’s music. It became an aspect of Stierlitz’s character. In this soulless world, it gave him a soul.“The main song, Moments, is based on a poem by Robert Rozhdestvensky about how each moment in life has profound significance. You could interpret it as being about the life of a foreign agent but it was written about life under a dictatorship, where any moment you could lose your position, your life, or betray someone and be promoted. It’s a philosophy born of Soviet life.”From that first broadcast Stierlitz became something of a Soviet folk hero, the anti-James Bond. “He’s a response to how the KGB was depicted as Smersh in the Bond films,” says Coates. “He’s very different from Bond. He spends more time gazing through windows than crashing through them. There’s a lot of smoking, a lot of being haunted by the motherland.”“I’d be fascinated to know if John le Carré has seen Seventeen Moments,” says Jeremy Duns. “Stierlitz is more like George Smiley than a Russian James Bond: a methodical, unemotional guy who silently observes while everyone else is digging their own grave.”Every year, the series was rebroadcast throughout Warsaw Pact nations on 9 May, the holiday that commemorates the surrender of the German army in 1945, and Stierlitz jokes became common currency, sending up the actor Tikhonov’s humourless, deadpan delivery. Yet the show did help to increase the Soviet people’s faith in their secret services, advancing the belief that the USSR had single-handedly won the war.The series had a curious afterlife in the chaos that marked the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1991, a St Petersburg film-maker made a short film about a local councillor, who’d previously worked as a Soviet spy in East Germany. One scene re-enacted the ending of Seventeen Moments, when Stierlitz drives back to Berlin. The councillor was filmed behind the wheel of his GAZ Volga with Tarivadiev’s Seventeen Moments theme, Somewhere Far Away, playing in the background.The councillor was Vladimir Putin. “It stuck,” says Newman. “People began to associate Putin with Stierlitz. Putin never said directly whether Stierlitz inspired him to become a spy. But he was 21 when the series was first screened and he joined the KGB two years later.”The association certainly didn’t do Putin any harm. In 1999, an opinion poll in the Kommersant newspaper asked readers who they’d like to see as Russia’s next president. Stierlitz came second, next to Marshal Zhukov, the Soviet Red Army general. The cover of the newspaper’s weekly supplement carried a picture of Stierlitz with the caption: “President – 2000.”“It proved that the second world war remained Russia’s highest point of achievement,” says Newman, “with military force still hugely respected. The previous president, Yeltsin, was boozy, jokey, generous. Now people wanted somebody a bit less Russian.”Amid the dishonesty and corruption of late-90s Russia, Putin stood apart – in no small way because he was seen as a Stierlitz-type figure. “Power should be mysterious and magic. Especially in Russia,” his former adviser, Gleb Pavolvsky, told Vanity Fair in October 2000. “Putin answers that need perfectly.”Eighteen years on, there can be few Russians who still think of Putin as Stierlitz, but the series remains ingrained in Russian culture. “Everybody still knows Seventeen Moments, even teenagers,” says Vera. “They’ve forgotten the name of the author, but the series? Yes, they all know it well.”• Seventeen Moments of Spring is at Pushkin House, London, 22-23 September. The score will be released by Earth Recordings in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ad4c9e4a767ba43ce9dc67eadaa92a133af5f3/0_45_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea4a00d60cd91358477ae7a9205142a5","title":"hurricane florence virginia south carolina evacuations","story":"South Carolina governor warns ‘this is a big, big storm’ as states brace for what could be the region’s most powerful hurricaneMore than a million people living along the coastlines of South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate their homes on Tuesday, as parts of America’s mid-Atlantic coast brace for what could be the most powerful storm to ever hit the region.Hurricane Florence is expected to bring potentially catastrophic winds, flooding and storm surge. Forecasters predict it will make landfall late on Thursday.Currently rated as a category 4 storm – the second most powerful on the national weather service’s (NWS) classification system – Florence would be the first storm of that magnitude in recorded history to strike the eastern coastline so far north if it remains on its most likely track.In its latest advisory on Tuesday morning, the US national hurricane center (NHC) said the storm is close to Category 5 in strength, and had slightly increased in speed as it heads toward the east coast. It is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane ahead of its potential landfall.“The bottom line is that there is high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity,” the hurricane center said.The NHC, which is based in Miami, said the storm’s center was located about 410 miles (660 kilometers) south of Bermuda and about 975 miles (1570 kilometers) east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina.McMaster ordered the evacuation of coastal areas to start at noon on Tuesday as Hurricane Florence approaches. He said the storm surge could reach as high as 10ft (3m) and estimated that 1 million residents would be leaving the coast.“We know this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient,” McMaster said of the decision. “But we’re willing to suffer some inconvenience.” He added that the disruption was worth the effort to save lives.“This is a big, big hurricane,” McMaster said, noting that wind speeds are predicted to be more violent than in either of the the region’s two most damaging storms of the past 30 years.Virginia’s governor ordered a mandatory evacuation for some residents of low-lying coastal areas beginning on Tuesday morning. State officials say 245,000 people live in the affected area, but officials warned the storm could affect the entire state.McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The governors of Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland have done the same. The designation gives officials the power to do order evacuations, establish shelters, prohibit travel and impose curfews.“Take steps now,” said North Carolina governor Roy Cooper over the weekend. On Monday he said: “We do know that we’re in the bull’s-eye.”On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump cancelled a scheduled appearance for Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was due to campaign for Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith. He sent a volley of tweets, calling on east coast residents to “be safe”.The NWS is predicting “life-threatening” storm surge and inland freshwater flooding, with some models predicting upwards of 2ft of rainfall. With winds of up to 150mph forecast, Florence will likely fell tree limbs and trigger power outages.Some forecasters are concerned that the storm appears likely to slow dramatically at about the time of landfall, like 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, which stalled out Houston, dropping huge amounts of rain over several days. That storm brought $125bn in damage last summer, mostly in Texas.Florence stands a significant chance of joining 2017’s Harvey and Irma as just the third storm to make landfall on the US mainland at category 4 strength (or higher) since 2005. When storms of that magnitude hit the lower 48 states, they usually travel through the warmer waters of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and rarely make landfall so far north up the eastern Atlantic coast. The last storm to hit the Carolinas as a category 4 was Hurricane Hugo nearly 30 years ago in 1989.Florida governor Rick Scott, whose state experiences the most hurricane-force storms in the US, pledged resources, expertise and guidance to the three states in which emergencies have been declared. Officials in North Carolina have already issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal Dare County and Hatteras Island. The governor also waived certain restrictions for trucks and heavy vehicles to help farmers harvest crops and move livestock before the storm, officials said.“North Carolina is no stranger to hurricanes,” Cooper said Monday, at least partially alluding to the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew, which struck the Carolinas as a category 1 storm in October 2016 killing 34 in the US, after cutting a vicious path across the Caribbean, killing more than 1,000 in Haiti.Off the state’s coast, large sea swells and dangerous rip currents were already apparent over the weekend, foreshadowing the storm’s arrival. Beachgoers have been warned to avoid the ocean, and ferries that service the state’s coast have been canceled.In Virginia, home to the world’s largest sea base, the US navy has ordered all ships to sea in preparation for the storm, where they can more safely ride out the violent wind and waves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7471b963d5b616a9c57a077179dcc1221032b93/0_430_5845_3508/master/5845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d6a7531a67994db249c6a8c64bae34b","title":"swedish election highlights decline of europes main parties","story":"Decline of the main parties is making it harder to form coalitions and pursue policiesLike all elections, Sweden’s has produced a lot of numbers. One number has received more attention than all the rest: 17.6, the percentage of the vote that went to the rightwing, anti-immigrant, nationalist Sweden Democrats – their highest ever score, and enough to make forming a new government a very complicated job for the mainstream parties.Meanwhile, three other parties – the ex-communist Left, the Centre party and the centre-right Christian Democrats – put on a total of 6.5 points. And the big established parties of the centre-left and centre-right, the Social Democrats and the Moderates, lost 6.3 points between them.The real story of Sweden’s election is not, as the prevailing narrative has it, the irresistible onward march of Europe’s far right but the continuing decline of the major parties of government, the fragmentation of national votes and the rise of a number of smaller parties.In a trend visible across Europe, the electoral base of the leading mainstream parties is shrinking. “The bigger parties are getting smaller and the smaller parties getting bigger,” said Sarah de Lange, a political scientist at the University of Amsterdam and a specialist in Europe’s radical right.Across the continent, mainstream parties and alliances that once dominated national politics are in retreat, most notably on the left, making coalition-forming harder – even in countries, like Sweden, long used to coalition government – and producing weaker, potentially shorter-lived governments.Simon Hix, a professor of European and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, said: “For me, the biggest take-home from the Swedish election is not the further rise of populists but the stunning volatility and party system fragmentation: it’s the Dutchification of European politics.”Across western Europe, from Germany to France and Italy to Austria, parties that have dominated their national political stages since the end of the second world war have lost votes or lost outright in recent elections, not just to nation-first populists, but to liberal, Green and anti-austerity parties, and even new centrist movements.Sweden, it seems, for all its historic two-bloc system and apparently cast-iron political stability, is no exception. “The bottom line is that Sweden is another European country: a fractured political landscape with the extremes doing better, including a populist party to the right,” said Carl Bildt, the conservative former Swedish prime minister.Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister, made the same point: “Sweden’s election result follows the pattern in western democracies,” he said. “An unclear result, complicated coalitions and the decline of mainstream parties.”Smaller and non-mainstream parties are poaching votes from the big parties on both sides of the left-right ide. Data shows the Sweden Democrats, for example, gained support in almost exactly equal measure from the centre-left Social Democrats and the centre-right Moderates.But overall the picture is consistent. Does this matter? Yes, say analysts, because the flimsy coalitions and splintered legislatures that often emerge from fragmented systems make it harder to govern. “They require coalitions involving more parties, and parties with a wide range of stances,” said De Lange.And that can make it harder for countries to adopt reforms, pursue controversial policies – such as welcoming refugees, a major factor for many voters in Sweden’s election – or play a decisive role on the international stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1503de2f692d637980dbb8b5951ca62b308c948/0_60_1989_1193/master/1989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0dd1ee36b699e5f1602e839ef0e348b","title":"catalans renew calls independence rally barcelona","story":"Huge crowds are expected at events marking 1714 fall of Barcelona as polls suggest region is ided on secessionHundreds of thousands of Catalans will rally on the streets of Barcelona on Tuesday to renew their calls for independence almost a year after the unilateral referendum that triggered Spain’s worst political crisis since its return to democracy after the death of Franco.The issue of independence remains isive in the region, however, with polls suggesting that Catalans are almost evenly split on whether to remain part of Spain.The annual Diada celebrations commemorate the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish war of succession on 11 September 1714, but in recent years they have been used by pro-independence groups as a show of strength.Two of the main anti-independence parties boycotted Tuesday morning’s wreath-laying ceremony at the statue of Rafael Casanova, hero of the siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the city fell to Spanish forces led by the Duke of Berwick, illegitimate son of James II.Citizens, the single largest party in the Catalan parliament, and the smaller People’s party stayed away on the grounds that it was sectarian.The Catalan Socialist party (PSC) has also withdrawn from the Diada’s institutional events for the first time this year. The opposition parties argue it has become a celebration that excludes half the population.Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, attended the ceremony but said she would not take part in the march later in the day because it explicitly demanded independence and therefore only represented half the Catalan population. “As mayor I have a duty to seek consensus,” she said.Organisers say 460,000 people have registered to take part in the rally, which was attended by up to one million people last year.On the eve of the Diada, Catalonia’s president, Quim Torra, said he intended to press on with plans to deliver the sovereign republic that was unilaterally declared last October by the government of his predecessor, Carles Puigdemont.The unilateral declaration prompted the Spanish government to sack Puigdemont – who fled to Belgium – take direct control of Catalonia and call a snap regional election. Several Catalan politicians, including Puigdemont, remain in self-imposed exile others are in prison in Spain awaiting trial for their roles in the push for independence.“This is not just about Catalan independence,” Torra told a meeting of international media on Tuesday. “It’s a struggle for basic rights and freedom of expression in Spain,” he said, citing the case of the rapper Valtònyc who was sentenced to three and half years prison for insulting the king.Torra insisted he was open to negotiation and said the prisoners have stated that they should not in any way be used as an obstacle to talks. He said that were Madrid to agree to a referendum the question would have be posed as a straight yes or no to independence, as in the 2014 Scottish referendum.While the socialist government of Pedro Sánchez has taken a less confrontational line on the Catalan crisis than the conservative administration it replaced in June, it has said negotiations must be conducted in accordance with the constitution.Sánchez, who met Torra in July, has offered a vote on greater Catalan self-government, but has firmly ruled out a referendum on either self-determination or independence. He has also warned that any unilateral attempts to create an independent Catalonia will result in the re-application of direct rule from Madrid.“Pedro Sánchez talks about self-government but what we’re interested in is self-determination. So far we can agree on the ‘self’ bit,” Torra said, adding that “at least Sánchez is looking for a political solution.”But the centre-right – and staunchly anti-independence – Citizens party was the biggest single winner in the vote, winning 37 seats.Inés Arrimadas, the party’s leader in Catalonia, has repeatedly criticised Torra and Puigdemont for ignoring the views of those Catalans who wish to remain part of Spain.“Like half of Catalans, we are excluded from the Diada, as we are on a daily basis,” she said on Tuesday morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620677.1536244336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the secret teacher if children are the future then it isn t all that bright","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Consumption of spirits starts early in secondary school you might not have noticed it because it’s diluted in the oh-so-innocent Fanta or Coca Cola.” Photo: iStockHere’s a dilemma: I enjoy teaching and I think it’s a wonderful vocation, but in daily life I’m often on the brink because I feel I’ve really had it with young people today.Even though they have the benefit of the latest technology and the most advanced research, they behave as though they don’t have a clue.

There is a more basic logic at play: why would they throw their own rubbish in the bin when the school has cleaning staff? Think about that, it makes sense.Food poverty also comes to mind of course, but we don’t learn much about that from the people whose stories we follow on Snapchat or Instagram, so we have no concept of how shocking it is to bin an entire packed lunch untouched.There was a time when saying thank you was a societal norm it’s something adults do without even thinking about it.Handing over money to a GP we nonetheless express gratitude verbally for the service they have just provided. At the checkout we thank the cashiers, even though they are getting paid to work there.But in just over two decades in the classroom, I notice an alarming decrease in the frequency of the thank-yous as the students leave after a class.Am I asking for too much by expecting them to be grateful? Maybe. But there is surely something amiss when an increasing number of adolescents are reluctant to make eye contact or extend the basic greetings at the start and end of class. After all, they are not struggling in the language of likes, retweets and faceswaps.Like the rubbish, graffiti is on the rise. It may not often take the form of serious damage, such as taking over a whole wall when nobody is looking, but rather the mindless doodling on the desk or wall around their seat. If they go on to do this out in the real world after leaving school, it will constitute criminal damage – but they are ignorant of this, and would laugh in your face if you pointed it out. I have had that experience.Consumption of spirits starts early in secondary school you might not have noticed it because it’s diluted in the oh-so-innocent Fanta or Coca Cola. This easily explains how girls can confidently leave the house so skimpily clad. It doesn’t explain how their parents can allow it, but that’s a different debate.Their mental health is also under strain. A recent survey of 2,500 teenagers found that almost two-thirds rated their mental health as “average”, “poor” or “very poor”. Isn’t this disturbing statistic either the chicken or the egg for that behaviour, I observe daily. Which is also a topic for another day, but the two are indisputably connected.One for the animal lovers now, and it comes with a warning (as did the video of the events when it was shared by animal rescues). In the early hours of August 13th, and in her own home, a tiny kitten was placed on a hot plate by one young man while a friend filmed. She was then kicked and flung around the kitchen like a rugby ball (also filmed).This came to light precisely because one of the perpetrators posted it online. The adults in the house were asleep upstairs and have since surrendered the kitten to be rehomed. The kitten, at least, is getting a second chance.So I’ll give young people another chance too. Of course I haven’t really had it with them – I am simply very worried."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Vicky Phelan the woman whose court case revealed controversy says finding a \u0026lsquowhitewash\u0026rsquoECHR maintains judgment on 1970s interrogation techniques used against prisoners in NorthBaby discovered by mother with cords around his neck when she went to check himFlanagan wants measure to help distressed mortgageholders to be passed as soon as possibleDoctors claim pay differential could rise to \u0026euro50,000 per year for those hired after 2012Ex-DUP special adviser Tim Cairns says he had not tried to smear Jonathan Bell over the affairIt is understood Rose Hanrahan (78) was killed during botched attempted robberyFirst man rescued from Co Fermanagh lake on Sunday following jet-ski incidentStrasburg Terrace residents say mobile app has directed 100 motorhomes their wayFive Irish universities ranked in latest employability rankings by QSOutgoing Barnardos chief executive says Ireland is no \u0027Republic of opportunity\u0027 for the poorNearly a third of buses inspected in past year had \u0026lsquomajor\u0026rsquo or \u0026lsquodangerous\u0026rsquo defectsFree legal aid centre says significant unmet need in relation to housing and homelessnessSe\u0026aacuten Gallagher and Senator Joan Freeman each secure backing of four councilsMinister for Health briefed on report about cervical screening controversy\u0026lsquoWe are in a new place, smaller, more humble,\u0026rsquo says Clogher diocesan secretaryClogher has just 58 active priests, 28 of whom are over 65, for its 85 churchesDyslexia more than 100 times more likely to be diagnosed than maths-learning disorderPSNI thanks garda\u0026iacute for assistance in locating 56-year-oldOne-third of children accessing age-inappropriate games on internet, survey reveals"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625480.1536670935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"child 1 in critical condition after becoming entangled in window blind cords","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBaby was rushed to Cork University HospitalA one year old child has been rushed to hospital in a critical condition after becoming entangled in window blind cords .The baby was discovered with the cords around his neck by his mother when she went to check on him at their house at Dublin Hill in Cork around 12pm.He was rushed by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where his condition is understood to be critical."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625435.1536667536!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup run in an unpleasant way chair of cash for ash inquiry claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInquiry chair  said the ‘clear inference’ was that Cairns was prepared to modify his comments about Jonathan Bell (pictured) to protect   Peter Robinson. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe chair of a public inquiry has said the Democratic Unionist Party was run in an “unpleasant” way.Retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin heard evidence from former party special adviser Tim Cairns in relation to the botched renewable heat incentive (RHI) green energy scheme in Northern Ireland. Mr Cairns told him he had not tried to smear his former boss, ex-Stormont enterprise minister Jonathan Bell, over the affair.Sir Patrick said the “clear inference” was that he was prepared to modify his comments about Mr Bell to protect former DUP leader Peter Robinson.Documents before the inquiry, including a text message from Mr Cairns to another party special adviser, showed he was prepared to, in his words, fit his story into the party’s “narrative”.Sir Patrick added: “That seems a rather unpleasant way to run a party.”Mr Cairns denied any plan to fit Mr Bell up.The former special adviser said he was being contacted by journalists constantly in December 2016, despite being outside Northern Ireland, and had sought help after Mr Bell disclosed his version of events surrounding the out-of-control heating scheme.Mr Cairns said politics was a “grubby world” and the inquiry chairman responded that was an understatement.Much of the former party official’s evidence contradicted Mr Bell’s version of events, discussed during the ex-Assembly member’s colourful evidence sessions before the inquiry last week.The green energy scheme paid over-generous subsidies to wood fuel burner owners.Concerns centre on how long it took to close after civil servants became aware of the flaws and the DUP’s alleged role, if any, in manipulating that closure date.The devolved powersharing institutions collapsed early last year after Sinn Féin walked out over the DUP’s handling of the RHI and repeated rounds of negotiations have failed to resurrect them.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625281.1536656046!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"locals seek help after influx of camper vans in dublin neighbourhood","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The car park at Strasburg Terrace near Irishtown, Dublin. Photograph: Cyril ByrneResidents of a small Dublin neighbourhood have called on city councillors to help sort out a camper van problem they say has developed in the area over the summer.Raucous behaviour, large dogs and 3am barbeques are among the complaints detailed in a letter to councillors from residents of Strasburg Terrace in Irishtown.They claim a mobile phone app catering to motorhome users is directing tourists to their neighbourhood (where a small, free, car park can be found) and to other locations nearby.Strasburg Terrace seems to appeal to French visitors in particular, with user comments under its listing on the park4night website describing it as “petit”, “tranquille” and “très pratique”.But locals have been less impressed. “Over the past two months the public car park in front of our houses has been adopted as a free campsite by increasing numbers of camper vans either owned or rented,” the letter to councillors says. “We have counted over 80-100 in the last two months.”The writer said that six camper vans were parked in the area on Sunday, August 5th, alone. “We have been in touch with Irishtown Garda Station who can really only get involved if public order issues arise,” they said. “We have also spoken to the parks ision in Dublin City Council who seem to have no responsibility within this matter.”The residents said it is inappropriate to use a car park in a residential area for overnight camper van stays, adding that a number of visitors have brought large dogs with them over the summer.“Whilst most of the campers are mature and do act responsibly there have been a number of public order issues with younger campers, mainly at night. These include drinking, raucous behaviour, littering, having a BBQ at 3am, playing loud music and on one occasion publicly urinating in front of number 5,” the letter says. The residents say they want a “total ban” on overnight camping in the area.The listing, created in June this year, on park4night describes Strasburg Terrace as a “small quiet car park near Irishtown stadium”.A number of comments, in French, under the listing say Strasburg Terrace is an ideal spot for visitors to Dublin, being calm, tranquil and a 30 minute walk from the city centre. “Pub pas tres loin,” mentions one comment: “Pub nearby”.But another review did advise: “Peut être difficile de se garer avec un grand camping car. Idéal pour les fourgons” or, “it can be difficult to park there with a large motorhome but it is ideal for vans.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3625350.1536662728!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit deal could be agreed within next two months barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier: ‘If we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks.’ Photograph: Yves HermanReuters The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said it was realistic to believe a Brexit deal could be agreed between the UK and the EU within the next two months.The pound jumped in value after he said during a visit to Bled in Slovenia on Monday: “If we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks.“That means that taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process in the House of Commons on one side, the European parliament and the council on the other side, we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it is possible.”EU leaders were expected to announce during a meeting in Salzburg, next week that an extraordinary Brexit summit would take place in November, as they give Mr Barnier extra encouragement to strike a deal with the British prime minister Theresa May. Discussions on the state of play in the talks will take place over a two-hour lunch at an informal summit in Austria, at which leaders were likely to instruct the EU’s chief negotiator to work with the best of Mrs May’s Chequers proposals.The EU27 would insist there needed to be resolution on the issue of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland by the time of a leaders’ summit in October in order for a deal to be possible.However, the special summit – likely to be held on November 13th – would then allow EU heads of state and government to wrap up the terms of a political declaration on a future deal on trade, security, aviation and fisheries, among other issues.EU officials and diplomats confirmed that such an announcement was expected although the plan was yet to be confirmed.Spokesmen for the European council and European commission declined to comment.A report in the Financial Times suggested supplementary guidelines – the formal documents produced by the leaders to instruct Mr Barnier – could also be under discussion in Salzburg.If approved, they would then be adopted at the meeting in October, the paper said. The Financial Times quoted a senior EU diplomat as suggesting the new instructions would “serve as a sort of mandate to do the deal”.Both EU and UK sources said the likelihood at this stage of such a formal move had been overblown.Senior diplomats representing the member states in the negotiations said that while there would be warm words at Salzburg, there were no plans as yet to offer up a new set of guidelines to Mr Barnier, or for them to be discussed by the leaders.EU sources noted that the heads of state and government had stuck with the same principles on the need to avoid “cherrypicking” from full EU membership since the start of the talks.It was understood the EU instead wanted to highlight the need for movement on the Irish border issue, and the lack of time available, while giving Mrs May something to show for her efforts before the Conservative party conference.By scheduling an extraordinary summit, one EU official said the message would be sent that time was too short to have everything in place by October, given the slow progress on the Irish border and other outstanding issues, such as geographical indications protecting food and drink products.It would also indicate, however, the determination of EU leaders to take ownership of the final political declaration, sources said, which the EU insisted would be unprecedented in its range.The British government was said to have been opposed to a November summit, fearing it would allow the negotiation timetable to slip.– "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624737.1536611593!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier s new brexit approach unlikely to ease may s woes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier  said a Brexit deal could be done within six or eight weeks, a statement that lifted sterling. Photograph:   Yves HermanReutersMonday at Westminster began with a little sunbeam of hope about Brexit in the shape of a Financial Times headline promising “Relief for May as Barnier set for go-ahead to pin down Brexit deal”. Michel Barnier offered more cheer later in the day when he said a Brexit deal could be done within six or eight weeks, a statement that lifted sterling.After a weekend of stories about Boris Johnson’s personal life and some overblown outrage about his use of a suicide vest metaphor, here was some good news at last. The EU leaders were about to give Barnier fresh instructions, telling him to stop being so legalistic and inflexible and to offer Theresa May a deal she could get through parliament.On closer examination, the Financial Times story said only that Barnier would receive a new negotiating mandate and it quoted sources warning that there was unlikely to be a significant softening of the EU’s approach. Barnier’s own statement later also fell short of a breakthrough, referring only to the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU.British hopes remain pinned on an informal meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on September 20th, when the prime minister will make the case for Chequers directly to the other EU leaders. The format will, however, be the same as in previous summits with May making a statement and then leaving before the others talk about Brexit among themselves.There will be no documents at the meeting and it will not produce official conclusions, so any formal movement on Brexit will have to wait until the October summit. Still, the noises that emerge from Salzburg are likely to be comforting enough for May to face her party at its annual conference in Birmingham a week later and to claim that her Chequers plan is still alive.Last night’s poorly attended debate on the EU Withdrawal and Implementation Bill illustrated the prime minister’s difficulty as Conservative Brexiteers lined up to condemn Chequers and to complain even about the terms of a post-Brexit transition period.Her Chequers proposal cannot command a majority in the House of Commons and Labour is almost certain to vote against any deal she presents to parliament. This leaves May back where she has always found herself, spending as much energy negotiating with her own party as with her interlocutors in Brussels."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He was said to be in a stable condition.Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to smallpox but not as deadly. It is usually mild and self-limiting with most people recovering within a few weeks, but severe illness and death can occur.It does not spread easily between humans but can be transmitted via close contact. PHE has contacted 50 people it considers to be at risk, including those sitting closest to the patient on the flight from Abuja to Heathrow on Sunday September 2.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said “all necessary steps” were being taken but that no other personnel had developed symptoms.The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.In humans, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox are similar to those of smallpox, but usually milderA painful rash with open sores can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. If the disease infects the eye it can lead to scarring of the cornea and, in some cases, blindness.Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free said: “Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. Most people recover within several weeks.Countries reporting monkeypox cases in humans and animals“It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.“It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE said:“It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.“Public Health England is following up those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.“PHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.”Monkeypox was first observed in the 1960s in monkeys brought to Europe from Africa, with the first human case diagnosed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970.Nigeria is experiencing a particularly virulent outbreak with 89 people infected and six deaths since 2017.Scientists are still unsure if the disease is transmitted by monkeys or via rodents.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyComment: The real Chequers battle will be fought not with alternative plans, but with Commons votesThe X-Files at 25: the truth is, it was terribleWould-be thief drops his gun, then his trousers in clumsy robbery in ColoradoLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowRussia joins forces with China in largest war games since Soviet eraRyanair cabin crew threaten \u0026#39biggest strike action this company has ever seen\u0026#39Ethiopia and Eritrea reopen border after 20 years as part of extraordinary rapprochementFuture of Europe – defence: can the EU actually protect itself against Russia?Greek PM warns that populists could tear \u0026#39technocratic\u0026#39 EU apartLabour MPs \u0026#39bullied\u0026#39 with deselection messages left on cards outside their Parliamentary officesBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results How popular is Donald Trump?

The US wants Kim to proceed with denuclearisation first, but North Korea wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53. North Koreans wave flowers at Kim Jong-un as he surveys their procession from a balconyHowever, the stalemate has been showing signs of softening in recent days. On Friday President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a personal letter from Kim Jong-un was going to be delivered soon. “I think it’s going to be a positive letter,” he predicted. Earlier the president had tweeted his thanks to Kim for his “unwavering faith” in him, adding “We will get it done together!” in reference to denuclearisation. Flare-up: aeroplanes forming the number 70 fly in formation “Kim and Trump are trading gestures to appease the US Congress and show to the world that the deal is on. And, indeed, the deal is on but Kim will not fully denuclearise,” North Korea analyst Loretta Napoleoni told The . Analysts have repeatedly warned that despite the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula, Kim has never committed to fully surrendering his nuclear weapons.  Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted that the understated nature of the Pyongyang parade indicated that North Korea “wants a version of the Israel deal.”He explained: “They don’t test nuclear weapons or show them off at parades we pretend they don’t exist.”According to reporters at the scene, the parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military segment featured soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of national history, then switching to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers alongside colourful floats. Kim Jong-un clasps the hand of Chinese envoy, Li Zhanshu during the paradeKim surveyed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung square, at times locking hands with Li Zhanshu, a senior envoy sent by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Foreign delegations from Russia, Syria, Vietnam and African nations reflected Kim’s concerted push this year in terms of promoting his own personal diplomacy and trying to cultivate a more statesman-like image.French actor Gerard Depardieu was in attendanceIn a break from recent tradition, he did not address the crowd. Instead Kim Yong-nam, the country’s ceremonial head of state told the audience that North Korea had achieved status as a military power, and would now pursue efforts to strengthen its economy.A gala was held on the eve of the 70th anniversaryThe anniversary celebrations also mark the revival of North Korea\u0027s iconic mass games after a five-year hiatus. The mass games involve tens of thousands of people performing precisely choreographed dancing in a symbol of national unity.  This year\u0027s spectacle - tickets start at just over $100 and go up to more than $800 per seat - also has a strong economic theme.Comment: The real Chequers battle will be fought not with alternative plans, but with Commons votesThe X-Files at 25: the truth is, it was terribleWould-be thief drops his gun, then his trousers in clumsy robbery in ColoradoLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowRussia joins forces with China in largest war games since Soviet eraRyanair cabin crew threaten \u0026#39biggest strike action this company has ever seen\u0026#39Ethiopia and Eritrea reopen border after 20 years as part of extraordinary rapprochementFuture of Europe – defence: can the EU actually protect itself against Russia?Greek PM warns that populists could tear \u0026#39technocratic\u0026#39 EU apartLabour MPs \u0026#39bullied\u0026#39 with deselection messages left on cards outside their Parliamentary officesBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results How popular is Donald Trump?

Maybe they will buy their dad a Jaguar one day too.”Vinehall School, whose Latin motto is pro aliis optimum agere - “to do our best for the benefit of others”, is near the Sussex town of Robertsbridge and caters for students aged two to 13.Its open day advert was shared on Twitter where users expressed anger at its sentiments, describing it as “vile”, “appalling” and  “wonderfully tone deaf”. The Independent Association of Prep Schools also took a dim view of the advert.A spokesman for the association said: “We understand that the school deeply regrets the advert and has apologised to the parents.“The message portrayed does not reflect the values of IAPS nor does it represent what Vinehall School stands for.”When contacted by The , Mr Powis said: “I very deeply regret the widespread offence caused by the recent open day advertisement.“It was wholly misguided, and should never have seen the light of day. I must stress it is in no way a reflection of the ethos of our school and the worthwhile work we do here.“We are taking a long hard look at how it came to be created in the first place, but as Head, I must take full responsibility for its appearance, and can only apologise for such an unfortunate error of judgement.“Vinehall prides itself on being a friendly, inclusive place, where the values of modesty and broad-mindedness are at the forefront of our guidance and teaching.”Mr Powis declined to confirm whether he drove a blue Jaguar.Please review our commenting policyComment: The real Chequers battle will be fought not with alternative plans, but with Commons votesThe X-Files at 25: the truth is, it was terribleWould-be thief drops his gun, then his trousers in clumsy robbery in ColoradoLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowRussia joins forces with China in largest war games since Soviet eraRyanair cabin crew threaten \u0026#39biggest strike action this company has ever seen\u0026#39Ethiopia and Eritrea reopen border after 20 years as part of extraordinary rapprochementFuture of Europe – defence: can the EU actually protect itself against Russia?Greek PM warns that populists could tear \u0026#39technocratic\u0026#39 EU apartLabour MPs \u0026#39bullied\u0026#39 with deselection messages left on cards outside their Parliamentary officesBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results How popular is Donald Trump?

The United Nations has called the border one of the world\u0027s most heavily mined.It was not clear if the countries would withdraw troops from the border.Mr Abiy on Monday told a new year\u0027s eve concert crowd of thousands in Ethiopia\u0027s capital, Addis Ababa, that as of today, Ethiopian and Eritrean people will prosper together and march in unison... The last five months have brought hope and reconciliation.The Ethiopian new year has roots in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and is related to the Julian calendar.Eritrea has used the Gregorian calendar since it gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.The reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea has been warmly welcomed by the international community and has led to a series of further thaws in the fragile Horn of Africa region, with Eritrea resuming diplomatic ties with both turbulent Somalia and the small but strategic port and military nation of Djibouti.Observers now wonder whether the thaw will inspire Eritrea\u0027s leader, who has led since independence without elections, to embrace reforms and loosen a strict military conscription system that has led the small country to become one of the largest sources of migrants fleeing toward Europe, Israel and elsewhere.Please review our commenting policyComment: The real Chequers battle will be fought not with alternative plans, but with Commons votesThe X-Files at 25: the truth is, it was terribleWould-be thief drops his gun, then his trousers in clumsy robbery in ColoradoLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowRussia joins forces with China in largest war games since Soviet eraRyanair cabin crew threaten \u0026#39biggest strike action this company has ever seen\u0026#39Future of Europe – defence: can the EU actually protect itself against Russia?Greek PM warns that populists could tear \u0026#39technocratic\u0026#39 EU apartLabour MPs \u0026#39bullied\u0026#39 with deselection messages left on cards outside their Parliamentary officesBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results How popular is Donald Trump?

Rigby had come up with the idea for Manchester’s first gin distillery when he was working as a film lecturer. He quit his job and tried running a bar, then realised he hated pushing a mop around.\u0026nbspIt was 2013, not long after Sipsmith had overturned an archaic\u0026nbsplaw preventing people setting up small distilleries. Gin distilling was on the rise. Rigby decided he wanted to make gin that captured the independent spirit of Manchester, but it took him two years to find a venue.\u0026nbspIncrease in regulations means small firms will struggle, trader warnsRBS to face no action over GRG small business lending scandalWith a year to go until Brexit, small businesses have big concerns“I almost gave up,” Rigby says. “It was almost impossible to find a place to start a business in Manchester City Centre. The railway arch we found in Redbank was the last roll of the dice.”His railway arch in the resurgent Green Quarter is now surrounded by small traders, from breweries and bars to a fitness studio and dry cleaners. Though arches can frequently be damp, awkward spaces, Rigby spent time turning his into the perfect place for small batch gin production. He enlisted his dad to help build all of the interiors by hand, including a mezzanine with a tasting area and a bar.\u0026nbspManchester Three Rivers\u0026nbspis in one of thousands of railway arches being sold off by Network Rail as part of a plan by the publicly owned company to concentrate on running the railways. Network Rail has said tenant leases will transfer to the new owner unchanged. But tenants like Rigby and his colleagues are facing months of uncertainty as Network Rail finalises the terms of the deal.Many tenants tell the same story. They moved in looking for a space near to city centres and cheap rent, and spent time adapting to the awkward shape of the properties and installing basic amenities like electric sockets and toilets. In recent years, Network Rail has put up rent across many properties, sparking fears that it is inflating the value of the estate in the run up to the sale. \u0026nbspNetwork Rail denies that rent increases are linked to the sale. It says it is selling the estate to invest in the railway. But the sale\u0026nbspcomes as Network Rail grapples with spiralling debts, which increased by £5.6bn to £50.4bn in 2017-18. The Office of Rail and Road, the industry regulator, has warned that Network Rail will run out of money to borrow in 2018-19.\u0026nbspSarah Arnold, a researcher at think tank the New Economics Foundation, has calculated that businesses in the railway arches being sold off by Network Rail contribute over £725m to the UK economy every year. “Every day we speak to small business owners who have had to shut down or relocate because of massive in-year rent increases, often leaving arches vacant for years,” Arnold says. “When you look at how much these arches businesses contribute to our economy, it doesn’t make any sense to put all of that at risk.”Danny Lennon is looking to move his business Footprint Scenery from three railway arches in Peckham, south London, after challenging Network Rail over rent increases of up to 100 per cent.Footprint moved to London to make props and scenery for television shows like Spooks and Hustle, with one eye on the 2012 Olympic Games. After London won the bid for the games, Footprint was recruited to make over 1000 props for Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony, from costumes\u0026nbspto books\u0026nbspto name placards for the athletes’ parade.“We started advertising the fact that we had done the Olympics\u0026nbspand it helped grow the business,” says Lennon, who started his career making props for children’s TV. The success of the 2012 opening ceremony has led to work making props for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and puppets for the 2015 European Games.Footprint grew\u0026nbspinto two and then three arches as it took on more work and more staff. But recent rent increases have taken their toll. “We had to lay off staff. Three full time staff that have gone, that’s coming in to half our full time workforce, which has increased the work on me and Agnes,” he says. “We’re looking to move.”Lennon has\u0026nbspappealed to\u0026nbspSouthwark Council for help finding a new property. Tenants in Hackney have been working with Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, who wrote to Chris Grayling, secretary of state for transport, on their behalf in June.\u0026nbspGlanville called for the sale to be paused and the estate to be ided up into smaller lots to allow for alternative offers. He also offered to discuss the potential for local authority investment.Jo Johnson, the transport minister, agreed to consider alternative proposals at a meeting in July arranged by s of the Arches, a campaign group set up by tenants including Manchester Three Rivers Gin and Footprint Scenery. But as the sale reaches its final stages, there are fears his response may come too late.Tenants caution that a single, remote and commercially driven landlord could lead to even more aggressive rent increases as the buyer recoups the cost of the sale, which is expected to come to £1.4bn. The bidders are said to include Blackstone, the world’s largest real estate investment manager, and CK Asset Holdings, an infrastructure investor founded by Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest man.\u0026nbspNhi Chu co-owns Chu’s Garage, which has been running out of the same arch in Hackney for 30 years, since her family escaped from Vietnam as refugees. In that time it has built up trust in the community and a loyal customer base. But recent rent increases have put the business on the verge of bankruptcy.“We have a simple request of the government,” Chu says. “Intervene in this sale and show that you really do support independent traders and entrepreneurs.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

It was shocking for me that the government, based on fundamental principles of human rights and values, has committed such a massive mistake. But I’m also very glad that they corrected the mistake swiftly.”Asked what the experience has been like for Mohamed, Mr Diallo said: “He’s been frustrated, especially when the kids in Brussels had to go back to school. He was alone. I was busy trying to sort things out so he had to stay with my mum who’s an elderly lady.“He was always asking questions: why am I still here? Why am I not back in Sheffield? Why can’t I see my mum?“I don’t wish any kid at all, on this planet, to go through what Mohamed has gone through.”Hawa Keita)Ms Keita, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, said last week that the situation had made her feel “dead inside”. She denied Home Office claims that she received a letter in March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.The letter, which Ms Keita said she saw for the first time by email on 28 August, states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing. She explained that she had moved to the UK and was living with another partner a British man and the father of Mohamed.UK news in picturesAlastair Cook celebrates his century in his last ever innings playing for England during the fourth day of the fifth test cricket match against India at The Oval.

But neither the Department for International Development (Dfid), which has provided the charity with £6m in funding over the past three years, nor the Charity Commission were made aware of the allegations\u0026nbspuncovered by The Independent\u0026nbspuntil two months ago.Despite the revelations, Dfid\u0026nbspsaid it would continue to fund Restless Development.The allegations come\u0026nbspin the wake of the Oxfam scandal –\u0026nbspin which the organisation covered up predatory sexual behaviour following the Haiti earthquake\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand subsequent criticism of the charity sector’s lack of transparency.The latest accusations\u0026nbspare specific to Restless Development’s operations under the International Citizen Service (ICS) – a government-funded programme which offers overseas placements, typically three months long, for 18- to 25-year-olds. Working in countries including South Africa, Tanzania and Bangladesh, ICS volunteers help set up schools, improve access to safe water and educate locals on health and hygiene.But young British people who volunteered in South Africa in 2012 and 2016 – after raising £800 of funding themselves – claim\u0026nbspstaff and other volunteers were involved in sexual relationships. They also said\u0026nbspthey were forced to stay in unsafe living quarters, told to travel with drunk drivers, and exposed to “unprecedented” violence between feuding taxi gangs.Those who raised the alarm say management\u0026nbspdismissed their concerns and “swept them under the carpet”.In 2016, two male volunteers in Libode, South Africa, allegedly engaged in relationships with female pupils they had been teaching in an ICS-associated school.Restless Development was made aware of the incident only when its London office was alerted\u0026nbspby a British volunteer’s parent. The charity admitted the students involved were taken back to the volunteers’ host homes, but claimed no sexual activity took place and\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspthe pupils were over the age of consent. The two male volunteers were subsequently dismissed.During the same placement – which was based in three towns in south-east South Africa – it was also alleged\u0026nbspa team leader had relationships with a string of volunteers, breaching the charity’s code of conduct.A staff member was additionally accused of sexual relations with a female British volunteer, while a\u0026nbspfield officer reportedly asked volunteers for money so she\u0026nbspcould buy alcohol. When not working in the community, volunteers are alleged to have repeatedly left their host homes to get drunk – despite being warned the area was dangerousRestless Development denies the allegations of sexual misconduct.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

More than 300 firefighters, five aircraft and two helicopters were mobilised to tackle the extremely difficult situation due to strong gusts of wind, Athens fire chief Achille Tzouvaras saidIn 2012, volunteers in South Africa were forced to stay in accommodation that had been broken into, with windows left smashed, despite reporting the incident to the charity and police. Restless Development said it subsequently strengthened its security protocols.Four years later, safety concerns were raised again – this time relating to dangerous transportation in Libode. Volunteers were expected to travel in taxis involved in violent feuds between rival drivers\u0026nbspthat saw a number of fatal shootings in the area. Volunteers said they were not told in advance about the risks. On two separate occasions, they were allegedly told to travel with a drunk taxi driver, though the charity says the issue was “resolved” at the time.Restless Development said “immediate action” was taken to address the “unprecedented” violence between taxi drivers and subsequently decided to stop bringing volunteers to the area.One British volunteer who worked in the charity’s Tanzanian office told\u0026nbspThe Independent that safety in general is a concern across the entire ICS programme – despite the mitigations put in place.Volunteers from 2016 also claim their concerns were dismissed by senior staff in South Africa, who put complaints down to a “failure to adapt” to circumstances. The volunteers said grievances were repeatedly “brushed under the carpet” and insist the London head office was alerted only to the most serious incidents.Issues with handling of complaints were not restricted to South Africa – one volunteer in Zambia “felt that volunteers were encouraged by staff to keep incidents to themselves so as to not scare the other volunteers”.Restless Development said it has phone lines set up in London and overseas specifically for volunteers to report concerns.But a former Youth Stops AIDS (YSA) employee who worked with Restless Development’s London team accused the organisation’s head office of “a lack of professionalism” and said they were not surprised by the allegations.A former UN employee echoed a similar sentiment, saying\u0026nbspthat the complaints made against Restless Development are not uncommon within international development.“Similar abuses occur in international development, some of which I, unfortunately, observed although to a much lesser degree,” he said. “The cases vary from minor abuse of authority to outright harassment.”Vicky Browning, CEO of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, admitted it was impossible to eradicate the sort of incidents seen in South Africa under Restless Development.AFPGetty)“Sadly we cannot guarantee zero incidents,” she said. “What we can do is make sure there is zero tolerance. We will not accept or allow it, we will not hide it – and we will deal with it.”\u0026nbspThe ICS scheme, which has provided placements for more than 17,000 British volunteers since it began in 2012, received £145m from the government – 90 per cent of its budget – between 2011 and 2018. Separately, Dfid\u0026nbsphas provided Restless Development with £6,392,267 over the past three financial years.Having been alerted in July to the allegations uncovered by The Independent, the Charity Commission said the “safeguarding related incident in South Africa in 2016” is now “being considered as part of our wider assessment to ensure that appropriate action has been taken.”Restless Development, however, claims it found no evidence to support any allegations of sexual misconduct or breaches of safeguarding. It said a “small number of volunteers” were disciplined for alcohol consumption, while an intern field officer who asked for money for alcohol was dismissed for inappropriate behaviour. On accusations of a lack of professionalism, it said: “Professionalism is built into our work and our values, and they are core to who we are and what we do.”Restless Development said: “We have in place a rigorous process to deal with incidents and complaints when they are raised and actively encourage our volunteers to report anything they have any concern or unease about. We have worked hard to take action in response to these concerns raised by volunteers, which included detailed action plans on improvements that we had already made and which we continued to implement based on their feedback.This included recommendations to strengthen the safety and security of our ICS programme to improve training for volunteers to better prepare them for ICS and to improve the quality of our ICS programmes in certain areas.If any volunteers past or present have concerns or feedback we urge them to get in touch.Department for International DevelopmentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log in"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/11/15/northern-ireland-troubles.jpg","title":"brexit northern ireland eu funding money peace process","story":"Created with Sketch.MEPs said the programmes\u0026nbspshould stay in place\u0026nbsp\u0027deal or no-deal\u0027\u0026nbspClick to followIndy PoliticsNorthern Ireland is a major beneficiary of EU regional development fundsNorthern Ireland should be allowed to keep hundreds of millions of pounds in EU funding after Brexit to keep the region’s peace process on track, the European Parliament has said.A report drawn up by the Parliament’s influential committee on regional development recommended that funding for two schemes – the Interreg and PEACE programmes – should continue whether “deal or no-deal” because of the invaluable role they have played in reducing community tensions.The programmes, whose total funding is £470 million, are currently 85 per cent funded by the EU and focus on building trust between the unionist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland.The report recommends that “post-2020, without prejudice to the ongoing EU-UK negotiations, EU support for territorial cooperation, especially regarding cross-border and cross-community projects, should be continued”.It says that there are legitimate “fears that an end to these programmes would endanger cross-border and inter- and cross-community trust-building activities and, as a consequence, the peace process”.The report was overwhelmingly backed by a vote of\u0026nbspMEPs\u0026nbspin plenary by 565 votes to 51. Conservatives\u0026nbspMEPs\u0026nbspnotably abstained, on the grounds that aspects of the report\u0026nbspraised questions about Northern Ireland\u0027s sovereignty after Brexit.Derek Vaughan, the committee’s rapporteur told MEPs: “Whatever happens in the future, deal or no-deal, the British government, the Irish government, and the European Union, should commit to continuing to operate and fund Interreg and the PEACE programme.An end to these programmes would endanger cross-border and inter- and cross-community trust-building activities and, as a consequence, the peace process“It has been huge economic improvement and tensions have been reduced. But we do know that those tensions still bubble away. When we were there on the delegation one of the things we were told is that some survey work had been done and since the referendum attitudes have hardened amongst the communities.”He added: “I hope nobody gets the impression, and they shouldn’t get the view from the report, that we’re saying that ‘no EU funds means a return to the Troubles’ – the report isn’t saying that, and I wouldn’t say that. But I am saying, and what the report says, is that EU funds have made a valuable contribution to reducing those tensions and conflict.”Corina Crețu, the EU Commissioner for regional policy, said that Northern Ireland was “undoubtedly one of the most telling examples of what cohesion policy has helped achieved in border regions and beyond”.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Women now need a Final SayFormer Tory minister joins calls for public to get final say on BrexitThe Independent has also launched its Final Say campaign – demanding a new vote – and more than 790,000 people have signed its petition.Alongside the People’s Vote campaign, The Independent will lead a protest in central London on 20 October to ramp up calls ahead of the government’s deadline for a Brexit deal with Brussels.While Theresa May has consistently dismissed such calls, and categorically ruled out a fresh vote, there are increasing demands within her own party and pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to voice his support for the idea.Asked by Reuters news agency through a freedom of information request what legal advice it had received this year on holding a second referendum, the Brexit department said there was a public interest in refusing to confirm or deny whether it had such information.\u0026nbsp“There is a very strong public interest in the most effective pursuance of the UK’s national interests abroad,” the department said.\u0026nbsp“It is necessary to consider whether the act of confirming or denying whether we hold information ... would be likely to prejudice the government’s negotiating position, which would be detrimental to the UK’s relationships with other states\u0026nbspand with European institutions, and would prejudice the promotion and protection of the UK’s interests abroad.”The department said it had concluded “the public interest favours maintaining the exclusion” of its duty to reveal whether or not it holds such information.It gave the same answer to a request for information on whether it had taken legal advice on the reversibility of Article 50, the notice of the intention to leave the EU served by Ms May in March 2017.In August, a poll for The Independent revealed\u0026nbspthat public backing for a fresh vote on the Brexit deal had leapt on the previous month by four points.Asked whether they would support or oppose the idea should a Brexit deal be brokered by the prime minister, 44 per cent of respondents backed a new vote, with 27 per cent opposing, 15 per cent not having strong opinions either way and 14 per cent saying they did not know.But four weeks later, amid increasing public isions over Ms May’s Brexit plans, from both inside and outside the Conservatives, 48 per cent said they wanted a second referendum.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/15/gettyimages-621950502.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/15/gettyimages-621950502.jpg","title":"conservative meps hungary victor orban eu sanctions far right george soros","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followIndy PoliticsConservative MEPs to protect Hungary’s far-right Orban government from EU sanctions in voteTheresa May’s MEPs will protect Viktor Orban’s authoritarian government from EU sanctions in an upcoming vote in the European Parliament, the Conservatives have said.Tory sources in Strasbourg confirmed that their MEPs would be voting against a motion to trigger the so-called Article 7 procedure to censure Hungary over alleged violations of the rule of law.Mr Orban’s government has been accused of violating press freedoms, undermining judicial independence, and waging a state-backed antisemitic campaign against Jewish businessman George Soros. It is also subject to allegations of corruption relating to the alleged misspending EU funds by Mr Orban’s friends and family, while the Prime Minister himself\u0026nbsphas described refugees as Muslim invaders and been accused of being deeply Islamophobic.\u0026nbspTory sources said their MEPs would oppose the process because they see it as “politicised” and that they believe the wrong approach is being taken. They say their MEPs’ decision is not a comment on the situation in Hungary.Labour branded the decision “disgraceful”, arguing that Orban’s “record on political freedom, equality and human rights, Islamophobia and antisemitism, shames Europe”.The Conservatives’ votes may prove decisive, as it is unclear whether the motion will pass: though a majority of all MEPs are expected to back the motion on Wednesday, it requires an enhanced two-thirds majority of votes to be successful.Mr Orban travelled to Strasbourg on Tuesday to make his government’s case in a debate in the European Parliament. The highest sanction under the process, if it is seen through to it conclusion, would be stripping Hungary of its voting rights European Council level a similar procedure is underway against Poland, which has been accused of undermining the independence of its judiciary.It is absolutely disgraceful that the Conservatives would even consider propping up\u0026nbspViktor\u0026nbspOrban\u0027s\u0026nbspFidesz\u0026nbspgovernmentThe vote was triggered after the European Parliament’s home affairs committee voted by 37 to 19 in favour of a report backing the censure motion. The Conservative MEP on the committee also voted against the plan then, joining with continental far-right parties including the French Front National, Austria’s FPOe, and Sweden Democrats.Asked about the vote, Conservative Home Affairs spokesman Dan Dalton said: “This report crosses a boundary by politicising what should be a purely legal matter.“If the EU\u0027s treaties have been breached by any Member State, it is for the European Commission to build a legal case against it. MEPs have no role to play in the process and their involvement leaves any subsequent legal action open to the accusation that it is politically motivated.“This report is misguided, counter-productive and sets a dangerous precedent. I hope parliament votes against.”World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Correspondent, in ManchesterClick to followIndy PoliticsJohn McDonnell will accuse the Conservative of taking workers’ rights back to the level of the 1930sJohn McDonnell will lay out plans to force companies to give\u0026nbspworkers a financial\u0026nbspstake\u0026nbspwhen he addresses a trade union conference later today.Speaking at the 150th\u0026nbspTrade Union Congress, the shadow chancellor will say\u0026nbspLabour would give employees the right to take part in “ownership funds” in order to “restore the balance of power in the workplace.Under a Labour government, he will say, all private companies with more than 250 employees would be forced to set up the funds to give workers a\u0026nbspstake\u0026nbspand more say over how the firm\u0026nbspis run.The changes would be introduced in law within the first year of a Labour administration led by Jeremy Corbyn.Addressing\u0026nbspunion\u0026nbspdelegates in\u0026nbspManchester, Mr McDonnell will say: “Labour’s programme of workplace reform will restore the balance between employer and worker with a significant extension of trade union rights, modernising corporate governance structures and extending the opportunity for employees to share collectively in the benefits of ownership of their company.“Labour’s common sense approach will forge a new workplace environment best suited to meeting the challenges of Britain’s ongoing low productivity and the emerging fourth industrial revolution.”Mr McDonnell will claim the Conservative government has taken employment rights back to a level not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.“The role of Conservative governments throughout history has been to restrict and restrain the rights and influence of workers to maximise the profits of the companies that so generously fund their party,” he is expected to say. “It’s a straight quid pro quo.“The Conservatives try to dress it up as securing some form of balance of power between workers and employers, but few today can argue that the balance hasn’t been overwhelmingly tipped against workers.”Should I vote Labour? Corbyn\u0027s biggest policies explainedLabour is committed to leaving the European Union but would have different negotiating priorities to the Conservatives. It has said it would have a “strong emphasis” on staying in the single market and the customs union.The party would drop “bogus immigration targets” but move to a managed system of migration favoured by many leave voters. It has said this “may include employer sponsorship, work permits, visa regulations or a tailored mix of all these”.Labour’s manifesto commits to balance government spending with the amount raised by taxation, which can mean little more than significant tax increases. The greatest burden will fall on higher earners but they cannot meet demand on their own. No one earning under £80,000 would pay any more in national insurance or income tax.Labour has promised more money for GP services, free hospital parking for patients, staff and visitors, and to take a million people off NHS waiting lists by guaranteeing treatment within eighteen weeks.The party has pledged to abolish university tuition fees and reintroduce maintenance grants and give free school meals to all schoolchildren.Labour’s manifesto commits to building 1m new homes, and would introduce controls on rent rises for private renters.Labour would ban fracking, but, crucially, also supports new nuclear projects.Its manifesto says it is committed to the NATO target of 2 per cent spending on defence. It is also committed to the renewal of Trident, even though Jeremy Corbyn has spent a lifetime campaigning against it.Labour is committed to leaving the European Union but would have different negotiating priorities to the Conservatives.

It is also committed to the renewal of Trident, even though Jeremy Corbyn has spent a lifetime campaigning against it.He will add: “Cumulative legislative assaults on trade union freedoms have seriously weakened the ability of trade unions to negotiate effectively on behalf of their members. The result is that for the first time shareholders now take a greater share of national income than workers.“The massive growth in zero hours contracts and the gig economy have produced a workplace environment of insecurity not seen since the 1930s. The decline of collective bargaining has meant that workers also now have little say over the key decisions taken by their employers over the future of their companies.Labour MPs who criticise Corbyn should quit party, McCluskey saysBacklash after Iranian state TV allowed to film Labour Party meetingArchbishop of Canterbury speaks out on Labour antisemitism rowPhilip Hammond, the chancellor, dismissed Labour’s plans.“This is Labour’s record on workers: the last Labour government left over half a million more people out of work and every Labour government leaving office with unemployment higher than when it started,” he said.“Under the Conservatives, there are over 3 million more people in work with the security of a regular pay packet, unemployment is at an all time low and the lowest paid have seen the fastest rise in pay for 20 years thanks to our introduction of the national living wage.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/12/ethiopia-eritrea-0.jpg","title":"ethiopia eritrea border leaders abiy ahmed isaias afwerki reconciliation peace","story":"Created with Sketch.Former bitter rivals make\u0026nbspstunning reconciliation to\u0026nbspimprove transport links between two countriesClick to followThe IndependentEritrea\u0027s president and Ethiopia\u0027s prime minister arrive for an inauguration ceremony marking the reopening of the Eritrean embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in JulyCelebrating their dramatic diplomatic thaw, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea on Tuesday officially opened the border where a bloody war and ensuing tensions had ided them for decades.\u0026nbspEthiopia\u0027s reformist new prime minister,\u0026nbspAbiy Ahmed, and long-time Eritrean\u0026nbsppresident,\u0026nbspIsaias Afwerki, visited the Bure Front along with members of their militaries to mark the Ethiopian new year, Mr Abiy\u0027s chief of staff Fitsum Arega said in a Twitter post.\u0026nbspThe two then opened the border post for road transport connectivity and would shortly do the same at the Serha-Zalambesa crossing, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel said on Twitter.\u0026nbspPhotos posted by both officials showed Mr Abiy in camouflage and sunglasses walking alongside Mr Isaias in olive drab, while civilians lined a road with the countries\u0027 flags in hand.\u0026nbspThe former bitter rivals have made a stunning reconciliation since Mr Abiy, weeks after taking office in April, announced that Ethiopia would fully embrace a peace deal that ended a 1998-2000 border war that killed tens of thousands.At the time, he announced that the countries would celebrate the Ethiopian new year together: We want our brothers and sisters to come here and visit us as soon as possible.\u0026nbspEmbassies have reopened, telephone lines have been restored and commercial flights between the capitals have resumed as some long-separated families have held tearful reunions.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/hurricane-florence.jpg  width= 1286  height= 964  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/hurricane-florence.jpg","title":"hurricane florence latest live updates track path olivia weather radar today category","story":"Created with Sketch.Families told they must leave\u0026nbspparts of\u0026nbspNorth Carolina, South Carolina and VirginiaClick to followThe Independent USFears strength could reach Category 5 before storm hitsWarnings of \u0027life-threatening storm surge\u0027Donald Trump assures state governors of \u0027247\u0027 federal aidHurricane Florence could hit the US East Coast later this weekHurricane Florence - LIVE: More than a million evacuated from projected path of storm amid warning of \u0027life-threatening\u0027 floodingHurricane Florence, currently a Category 4 storm,\u0026nbspis bearing down on the US eastern seaboard forcing authorities to issue mandatory evacuation orders amid fears of “life-threatening” floods and storm surges up to 12ft high.Trackers fear Florence’s 130mph winds may strengthen further to Category 5 before it hits, as the Carolinas and Virginia brace for predicted landfall between Thursday and Friday.

Some isolated areas could get 30 inches, forecasters said.Florence is currently about 950 miles east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, the NHC has said.\u0026nbspMaximum sustained winds are about 130mph and, although the storm has weakened slightly, trackers expect it to regain strength over the next day or so.\u0026nbspThe new data comes from a reconnaissance aircraft.Retailers in North Carolina have been warned not to hike prices on key supplies ahead of Hurricane Florence\u0027s impact.\u0026nbspJosh Stein, the state\u0027s attorney general, warned companies and shopkeepers that a law against price-gouging had been brought into effect by the governor\u0027s declaration of a state of emergency on Friday.\u0026nbsp“My office is here to protect North Carolinians from scams and frauds,” he said in a statement.\u0026nbsp“That is true all the time,\u0026nbspbut especially during severe weather.

It\u0027s preventing people from driving and continuing about their day.Via the Associated Press news agency, a few details about what may be at stake when Florence strikes:\u0026nbspThe storm\u0027s potential path includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous hog farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons.\u0026nbspFlorence has sustained winds of over 130 mph and before it dies the storm may stall over the Carolinas, leading to “exceptionally heavy” and sustained rains, experts said.The storm’s first effects were already apparent on barrier islands as dangerous rip currents hit beaches and seawater flowed over a state highway.\u0026nbspStates of emergency have been declared in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.“The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous,” Donald Trump tweeted Monday. “We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials. The Federal Government is closely monitoring and ready to assist. We are with you!”State governors said they would open shelters for displaced residents.Behind Florence in the Atlantic are at least two other storm systems, Hurricane Isaac and Hurricane Helene. In the Pacific, the state of Hawaii is expecting to be hit by its second hurricane of the season if Hurricane Olivia makes its way to the islands as predicted. Isaac has weakened in recent hours, the NHC said.Things lost and saved: One year on from Hurricane IrmaDuring September of 2017, the Caribbean was hit by two powerful hurricanes, Irma and Maria.

The house he grew up in was badly damaged by the hurricane. “This house is very sentimental to me - it has been in my family well over 80 years and it means a lot to us. I grew up in this house as a little boy until I left for high school. It belonged to my grandparents, and now belongs to my uncle who is 91.

She was on holiday in Grenada when the hurricane hit, but returned home to find her business badly damaged. “Everybody always comes to my restaurant and says they’re here for my patties. I make them every morning, wake up and come down to my shop to make them from scratch. The hurricane did some damage to my restaurant though - all the windows and doors gone. It’s a good thing that the Red Cross was there to give me some help buying them back so I could keep my business going.” Lorie, a keen viola player, saw his most treasured possession damaged in Hurricane Irma, all he has now is the broken remains. “My house I will build back, but there’s no way that I could replace my instrument, my viola, I cannot replace it. It was just precious, I can still hear it in my mind how it used to sound. I would give anything if I might be able to purchase one again, a used one. It has to be very old and seasoned wood, maybe 30, 40, 50 years old. I’m going to take this one with me to the UK and have it repaired.” 81-year-old Lucia, who had lived in her home for 60 years before it was destroyed by Hurricane Irma, is looking forward to returning to her own home. “When I see the destruction and I see what I had loved so dearly I sit down and I cry. The whole roof went, the shutters, and a brand new washer that I had just bought. I lost all my dining chairs, my living room set and a lot of my clothes, but I’m not worried about that, as long as I could find something to wear. But I saved a few things, maybe some are salvageable or maybe not. My favourite thing that I lost is the deeds to my land. I hope that I will get back in the house soon, because when you get to my age you like to be by yourself.”Hurricane Irma destroyed almost everything Darrel owned, including his much-loved photo-album, but he managed to recover one of his favourite childhood toys. “This is my best friend – I have carried him with me my whole life. When I got married he was with me, when I got orced he was with me, he goes everywhere I go. I was so happy when I realised he hadn’t been damaged in the hurricane.” When Irma hit, Rasheed sheltered in the bathroom with his mother, father and brother - from there all they could do was watch as Irma shattered their home. “The first thing that Irma blew out was the windows and then once the wind started to circle through the house it lifted up the doors and the roof, and once that was gone there was no protection and everything just started to float through the doors. Even my computer and PlayStation and all my gaming stuff was blown away, I didn’t even think to protect them. We could see the damage through the window in the bathroom but there wasn’t anything we could do at that point.” During September of 2017, the Caribbean was hit by two powerful hurricanes, Irma and Maria.

It was just precious, I can still hear it in my mind how it used to sound. I would give anything if I might be able to purchase one again, a used one. It has to be very old and seasoned wood, maybe 30, 40, 50 years old. I’m going to take this one with me to the UK and have it repaired.” 81-year-old Lucia, who had lived in her home for 60 years before it was destroyed by Hurricane Irma, is looking forward to returning to her own home. “When I see the destruction and I see what I had loved so dearly I sit down and I cry. The whole roof went, the shutters, and a brand new washer that I had just bought. I lost all my dining chairs, my living room set and a lot of my clothes, but I’m not worried about that, as long as I could find something to wear. But I saved a few things, maybe some are salvageable or maybe not. My favourite thing that I lost is the deeds to my land. I hope that I will get back in the house soon, because when you get to my age you like to be by yourself.”Hurricane Irma destroyed almost everything Darrel owned, including his much-loved photo-album, but he managed to recover one of his favourite childhood toys. “This is my best friend – I have carried him with me my whole life. When I got married he was with me, when I got orced he was with me, he goes everywhere I go. I was so happy when I realised he hadn’t been damaged in the hurricane.” When Irma hit, Rasheed sheltered in the bathroom with his mother, father and brother - from there all they could do was watch as Irma shattered their home. “The first thing that Irma blew out was the windows and then once the wind started to circle through the house it lifted up the doors and the roof, and once that was gone there was no protection and everything just started to float through the doors. Even my computer and PlayStation and all my gaming stuff was blown away, I didn’t even think to protect them. We could see the damage through the window in the bathroom but there wasn’t anything we could do at that point.” Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg","title":"china muslims uighur reeducation islam xi jinping communist party xinjiang","story":"Created with Sketch.Communist Party denies unfairly detaining Muslims\u0026nbspbut crackdown\u0026nbspdescribed as brainwashing by critics and witnessesClick to followThe IndependentReleased detainees say they were forced to listen to lectures, sing pro-communist hymns and write \u0027self-criticism\u0027 essaysInside China’s ‘re-education centres’ where Uighur Muslims are pressured to give up IslamOn the edge of a desert in far western China, an imposing building sits behind a fence topped with barbed wire.Large red characters on the facade urge people to learn Chinese, study law and acquire job skills. Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uighur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uighurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uighurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Car manufacturing plants idled as deliveries are delayed. Mountains of paperwork paralysing small companies that can\u0027t afford teams of lawyers.Not since the 1970s have port towns like this had to deal with customs in their massive trade with Britain, and that could change on Brexit day on 30 March\u0026nbsp2019. Britain and the European Union are struggling to agree on the terms of business after that date, raising the chances of a sudden return of tariffs and border controls. And while Brexit has not so far been a big concern for many people in continental Europe, the prospect of there being no deal is starting to unnerve companies and authorities – particularly in places like ports that operate on the front lines of global trade.“It is scary,” says Marc Adriansens, the managing director of the ICO car shipping company. “Now, all companies around here and on the continent, they start to be worried. And they say: ‘Okay, it could be serious\u0027.”Kristian Vanderwaeren, the administrator-general of Belgian customs, says this will cost companies a lot to prepare for. “It\u0027s a huge, huge problem,” he says.Ominous warnings of what would happen if trade is suddenly disrupted between Britain and the EU have dominated headlines since the campaign before the Brexit vote in June 2016.The aim for both Britain and the EU is to agree on the terms of future trade as well as on two-year transition period after Brexit day that would give companies and governments more time to adapt to any new rules.The lack of progress is raising the risk of Britain falling out with no agreed terms, a feared situation called variously a “hard”, “no-deal” or “cliff-edge” Brexit.What is at stake is visible during Mr Vanderwaeren\u0027s check of the port – in the brisk traffic of trucks on the aptly-named Britannia dock. Everything from engine parts to orange juice is lined up for transport to Britain, part of the half-a-trillion pounds in goods and services traded between the continent and the UK\u0026nbspevery year.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The IT system has been upgraded, scanning machines for customs checks have been bought and more sniffer dogs will be made available.“We are preparing for a Brexit-proof port,” said Mr Coens.The Republic of Ireland, an EU member country, gets most of its goods transported through UK\u0026nbspterritory and has sought to ensure it is not cut off from the rest of the bloc because of Britain\u0027s exit.It got help from a new ship, formally called the “Celine” but also dubbed “the Brexit Buster”. that will be able to transport goods directly between Dublin and Belgium, bypassing Britain.Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar was on hand when the ship, which is 234 meters\u0026nbsplong and has nine decks big enough to carry vehicles, was christened in April.Brexit will fail regardless of Boris Johnson and Theresa May\u0027s jabsWe know Brexit will disrupt healthcare, shouldn’t we get a Final Say?Turtles, whales and birds under threat from Brexit funding cutsDrop hard Brexit or we\u0027ll back public vote, trade unions tell MayNo-deal Brexit \u0027could lead to the military on the streets\u0027That will not be enough, however, to soften the impact of a “hard” Brexit on Zeebrugge, where nearly half of all goods shipped through the port either goes to or comes from Britain.Mr Adriansens says his company handles half of the one\u0026nbspmillion cars traded annually with Britain through the port.After the Brexit vote in 2016, sales went down by 15 per cent and have not recovered. He says there could be another 20 per cent drop if Brexit happens without a trade deal.“Out of the 500,000, this is 100,000 cars...This is something we don\u0027t like to lose, but we cannot control that,” he said.Beyond the volume of business, the speed of transport is also key, not just for perishable goods like food that can rot if left in containers but also for manufacturing products.Modern car plants, for example, do not store many parts on location, meaning their production schedule depends entirely on the timely delivery of the parts, often from various countries.That production could get held up if Brexit creates traffic jams on both sides of the channel.About 4,000 trucks drive through Zeebrugge to Britain, says Mr Coens.“If they are even blocked for a few hours then you have 60 kilometres (40 miles) of blockage,” Mr Coens added. “Nobody wants that.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/17/india-flooding.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906401  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/17/india-flooding.jpg","title":"sweden democrats election exit poll latest social democratic party far right moderates","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentSweden Democrats: Far-right party claims victory despite third-place finish in general electionThe leader of a far-right party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement says it has “won” Sweden’s national election, after preliminary results showed it secured more than a sixth of the vote.\u0026nbspAfter a campaign dominated by debates over immigration, 17.6 per cent of the electorate opted for anti-immigrant party the Sweden Democrats, up from 12.9\u0026nbspper cent in the last election.\u0026nbspVoters simultaneously handed Sweden’s ruling Social Democratic Party its worst-ever election result – 28.4 per cent as the count neared completion – though that was still enough to leave it the single largest party in the Riksdag, Sweden’s parliament.\u0026nbspHung parliament looms as far-right sees rise in supportMajor gains expected for far-right party as Sweden goes to pollsHow a nationalist, anti-immigrant party took root in liberal SwedenThe ruling Social Democrats, Greens and Left Party coalition won 40.6 per cent\u0026nbspof the votes while the opposition bloc made of the Moderates, the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party and the Liberals won 40.3 per cent\u0026nbspof the votes.The potential for an immigration backlash resulting in a big boost for the Sweden Democrats inspired fear among many Swedes before the election.

It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed.Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the centre-right bloc in which the Moderates is largest of four parties have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a coalition partner.Sweden – home to the Nobel prizes and militarily neutral for the better part of two centuries – has been known for its comparatively open doors to migrants and refugees.Sunday’s general election was the first since the country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 as mass migration to Europe rose dramatically.Mr Lofven eventually said Sweden could no longer cope with the influx and immigration laws were tightened.\u0026nbspPartyNumber of seatsNumber of seats in previous electionSocial Democrats\u0026nbsp101\u0026nbsp113Green Party\u0026nbsp15\u0026nbsp25Left Party\u0026nbsp28\u0026nbsp21Centre-left bloc\u0026nbsp144\u0026nbsp159Moderates\u0026nbsp70\u0026nbsp84Centre Party\u0026nbsp31\u0026nbsp22Liberals\u0026nbsp19\u0026nbsp19Christian Democrats\u0026nbsp23\u0026nbsp16Centre-right bloc\u0026nbsp143\u0026nbsp143Sweden Democrats\u0026nbsp62\u0026nbsp49Like other far-right parties in Europe, the Sweden Democrats, which first entered parliament in 2010, has strived to mend its public image in recent years in a bid to garner more supporters.Sweden Democrats\u0026nbspleader, Jimmie Åkesson, has claimed there is no place for racism in the party and has expelled\u0026nbspsome members for expressing pro-Nazi views. He has also changed the old party symbol, a flaming torch, into a softer looking blue and yellow flower.He has also, however, infamously called Sweden’s growing Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”.His party presented the vote on Sunday as a ballot on hot button issues including immigration and Sweden’s famous welfare system.The party\u0026nbspmade its first mark in politics by gaining\u0026nbspmunicipal council seats in 2006, and since then slowly helped revise long-accepted social norms for what Swedes could say openly about foreigners and integration without being considered racist.At a post-election rally, Mr\u0026nbspÅkesson said the party’s improvement on the 12.9 per cent\u0026nbspit scored in 2014 represented victory.“No one can take that away from us,” he said. “We will have an immense influence over what happens in Sweden in the coming weeks, months, years.”He also criticised Mr Lofven’s government for “prioritising” the needs of new immigrants over the ones of Swedish citizens.“We won,” he said as he declared the estimated 14 parliament seats the Sweden Democrats picked up a victory other parties could not ignore in coalition negotiations.“This party has increased and made the biggest gains. Everything is about us,” Mr Åkesson said. “I am ready to talk with others.”Although Sweden\u0026nbsphas long been lauded as a bastion of liberal values, fears of straining its generous welfare system prompted a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment in recent yearsIn May, the government announced plans to cut, almost by half, the number of refugees and migrants entering the country.This may mean some kind of accommodation of the Sweden Democrats may be likely –\u0026nbspif not now, then some time in the future.Many therefore believe\u0026nbspthe Moderate Party leader, Mr Kristersson will seek to form a minority centre-right administration with ad hoc parliamentary support from the Sweden Democrats and\u0026nbsppossibly an official alliance with the Christian Democrats.What any\u0026nbspagreement could look like remains to be seen and according to Nicholas Aylott professor of political science at Södertörn university could result in “a rather extreme form of minority government – one whose only party has attained just a quarter or even a tenth of the seats in parliament.”And though this situation has been brought about by the rise of the Sweden democrats and\u0026nbspother parties struggles on how to manage their presence in parliament, some observers say that the patterns of voting this election does not necessarily indicate the rise of the right wing.”The aggregate movement of voters does not say everything about the way in which voters have shifted parties from the previous election to today. The losses of the social democrats are not necessarily the gains of the radical right.” Professor Sarah De Lange, from\u0026nbspthe University of Amsterdam, who specialise in\u0026nbsppopulist\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspradical movements. “More striking than the gains and losses of inidual parties is the further fragmentation of the party system. The bigger parties are getting smaller and the smaller parties getting bigger.”“Instead, the voters that have deserted the social democrats and the mainstream right are likely to have left to a variety of parties for a variety of reasons,” Ms\u0026nbspDe Lange addedOthers believe if a shift does not occur in Swedish politics then the Sweden Democrats are likely to continue to make larger gains similar to other far right parties across Europe.“If things carry on as they are going, it will happen,” said Ann-Cathrine Jungar, a far-right specialist at Södertörn University. “In Denmark, Norway, Austria, the far right is now accepted by the centre right. I can see that here one day.”Swedish Journalist Alex Valencia Rodallec agrees: “If the other parties can break the block system this might mean Sweden Democrats’s decline. This is still a win for them so everything depends on the other parties. If they keep adopting SD’s policies then we will see a continued growth”.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"royal","story":"PRINCESS Diana\u0027s former lover Oliver Hoare has died after a long battle with cancer.

We have always maintained this is a witch hunt.Mr Kov\u0026aacutecs added: \u0026ldquoInstead of leaving, which many would probably like to see, we would rather demonstrate for the EPP that our stand, our perspective, is something that would help the EPP to remain the strongest political \u0026hellip group in the European Parliament.His government published its own 109-page \u0026ldquoinformation sheet taking issue with the report, which was approved by the European Parliament\u0026rsquos civil liberties committee.Mr Orban was elected for a fourth term in April for his anti-immigrant nationalist policies.Austria\u0026rsquos chancellor Mr Kurz has close ties to Hungary\u0027s Prime Minister, a fellow immigration hard-liner.The Austrian Chancellor has said he hopes to use those ties to build bridges between western EU member states and eastern ones that have clashed over immigration and other issues.But it appears Mr Kurz has turned on Hungary. He said: The Austrian conservative lawmakers will vote in favour because we believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy and it is therefore important that the accusations that have been made against Hungary are cleared up.Mr Kurz appeared to suggest that other Eastern European countries should also face an Article 7 procedure.He said: It is ... not only necessary to take a closer look at Hungary but also when we look at the situation in Poland, in Hungary, in Romania, in Slovakia, where there was recently a murder of a journalist, there too it is necessary to look very closely.Austria\u0027s five conservatives are a tiny fraction of the two-thirds of votes needed in the 750-seat assembly for the so-called Article 7 procedure to pass. That would set in motion a process that could lead to sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary\u0027s voting rights.Mr Kurz\u0027s People\u0027s Party is in the same conservative bloc in the European Parliament as Mr Orban\u0027s Fidesz. Austria also holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year.Mr Orban was due to address the European Parliament on Tuesday ahead of a vote on the Article 7 procedure later this week.His Fidesz party won a parliamentary election last April by a landslide, buoyed by migration policies including a refusal to take any resettled asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa after a wave of arrivals in Europe that began in 2015.Mr Orban has put pressure on courts, media and non-government groups since he came to power in 2010. Though the EU has often protested, it has largely failed to stop him in what his critics denounce as a growing authoritarian drive.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future. It will strengthen our hand in negotiations, too.So get on with THAT, Prime Minister.THE Russian bear is roaring, and we don’t seem ready to defend ourselves.Today a respected intelligence expert suggests our border control could have been hacked by Russian spies in the run-up to the Salisbury attack.The Prime Minister has been admirably tough with the Kremlin, even if Jeremy Corbyn and other useful idiots have attempted to undermine her and our ­national security at every turn.But there is no room for complacency.

I wouldnt necessarily interpret it as helping May.However, the news was welcomed by Eurosceptics who have repeatedly called on Member States to pressurise the hard-line Commission to compromise.Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe think tank and a former advisor to Michael Gove, said: This is long overdue.The EUs only offer is a trade agreement for just Great Britain, essentially annexing Northern Ireland in a separate regulatory and customs regime. Impossible.Even if he is, Theresa May must not follow suit.The Chequers offer is already so over-generous it has triggered Cabinet resignations and Tory mutiny. If Barnier now wants to make it work for fear of a No Deal, it is a signal for us to realise the EU is on the back foot and to extract more concessions.Mrs May must not give an inch over free movement or anything else. Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.Barnier has been overplaying his hand for two years.

On Friday, February 3, 1961, the reservoir overflowed down the spill for the very first time. I remember that day well.She was brought up there from the age of 4 to 13, an only child, with her mother, father and a succession of cats and other animals.The traditional cottage and cow barn were built from granite quarried on the site itself.They were beautiful buildings in a remote wooded valley bottom surrounded by wildlife and a wildflower-filled meadow.Margaret said: It was very beautiful - I cant emphasise that enough: absolutely lovely.But when Margaret was 13, she and her parents moved to her grandparents house at nearby Sancreed where she still lives today.Soon after, Nanquitho was compulsorily purchased and demolished to create a supply of drinking water for the local area.From planning to completion, the dam at Drift took 23 years to build, and between 1938 and 1961 a number of families moved out.Margaret can still see where the Lost Valley once stood from her bedroom window.She remembers the waters drawing back to reveal the skeleton of her old home in the 1970s, the 1990s, and once again, this summer.She said: It was strange to see the ruins: not eerie, but very interesting."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432156526-e1536606196495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"strictly stacey dooley celeb island","story":"They have to mask their disappointment, I understand, but the words “Your partner will be . . .  KEVIN!” were no sooner out of the host’s mouth than he was off, pogo dancing round the studio, punching the air and screaming: “YAAAAAAAAAS YES! YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is.

What’s the difference, voters will wonder, between Labour and the Tories if both will raise my tax?The overall burden is at a 30-year high. We should cut income tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty. It is a sure way to boost growth. Bizarrely, it can sometimes increase the sums raised.Donald Trump’s cuts to tax and regulation put rocket-boosters under US growth. We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more life out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable.

In February last year, Unilever received an unwanted 143bn takeover approach from Kraft, the US consumer goods giant still notorious on these shores for its \u0026#16311bn takeover of Cadbury just under a decade ago.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"Kraft\u0027s interest was easily repelled, but the move gave Unilever\u0027s board the shock of its life, immediately sparking big changes in the way the company is run.Becoming a purely Dutch company will protect Unilever from future bids like Kraft\u0027s because Dutch firms enjoy greater protection from takeovers than British ones. That, UK investors suspect, is the real reason for this reorganisation.Unilever has also argued that there is greater turnover of shares in Unilever NV than there is in Unilever plc - making the Dutch class of share the obvious one in the reorganisation.That overlooks the fact that the London stock market is substantially bigger than its counterpart in Amsterdam and that the greater number of shares in Unilever NV actually change hands in London.What makes this decision really interesting is that Relx, the Anglo-Dutch business information company, has just carried out a similar simplification of its shares.The only difference is that Relx, formed in 1992 from the merger of British publisher Reed International and Dutch firm Elsevier, has opted for Relx plc shares to be the sole class of share going forward. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell, the other big Anglo-Dutch corporate giant, has its company headquarters in the Netherlands, but the primary listing for its shares is in London.This issue has attracted far more attention in the Netherlands than it has in the UK - because the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has eased the way for Unilever by proposing to abolish the country\u0027s 15% withholding tax on company dividends.Ironically, this merely brings the Netherlands into line with the UK\u0027s taxation regime, but is widely regarded as having helped influence Unilever\u0027s decision.However, it has also kicked up a political stink in the Netherlands, with many people unhappy at what they see as a generous tax cut to big business. It is possible Mr Rutte may yet fail to get the legislation through the Dutch parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

Labour say it\u0027s an undemocratic power grab. Final plans to slash the nation\u0027s 650 MPs to 600 have been revealed, and it\u0027s fair to say not all MPs are happy. Household names from Jeremy Corbyn to Boris Johnson will have their seats sliced up as members are pitched into a musical chairs game of political survival. So why are there new constituency boundaries, where will they be, why are people angry - and will they actually happen? Here\u0027s a quick guide.  At the moment, Westminster seats have wildly different numbers of registered voters. That means some MPs have a smaller mandate - representing 60,000 people instead of 100,000 - but still get the same voice in Parliament. Politicians decided this was unfair, so in 2016 a review of current seats was launched. Carried out by four independent Boundary Commissions, it ensures all constituencies have roughly the same number of voters - between 71,031 and 78,507. Those commissions have now sent their recommendations to the government.  The \u0026pound5m review has been slammed for slicing up far more Labour than Tory seats. Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, from the Elections Centre at Plymouth University, found the Tories would have a working majority of 23 in last year\u0027s election if the new boundaries were used. There are several reasons for this. Mainly, at the moment, city areas where Labour thrive tend to have fewer voters in each seat. That means in theory, Labour is being overrepresented in the Commons. But importantly this is only fewer registered voters. Students often don\u0027t show up in figures until an actual election time. And the number of voters used for this review was frozen in time in December 2015. That means the review has left out a surge of more than 2million voters who signed up for the EU referendum and 2017 general election. With many young people and students signing up, this could mean Labour-dominated cities and young voters are under-represented in the new seats. Labour MP and shadow Cabinet minister Jon Trickett branded the proposed changes a disgrace and a Tory stitch up. How will Labour decide who stands where?  From our guide to the system back in 2016: When more than 40% of an MP\u0027s current constituents transfer to a new seat, that MP gets reselected automatically in a trigger ballot. If two Labour MPs both have a 40% claim on the same new seat, which happens in several cases, they can stand against each other in a vote by their new Constituency Labour Party . There will be three options on the ballot - MP 1, MP 2, and an option to reject them both and have an open contest. But the open contest must get 50% or more to pass. So if MP 1 gets 41%, and an open contest gets 45%, MP 1 will still get selected. If an MP doesn\u0027t have a 40% claim on any seat, they are not automatically eligible. They\u0027ll have to apply to Labour\u0027s NEC for a legitimate claim on another seat or start their careers again.  Will it be bad for everyone? No, not at all. Some MPs may find their majority actually gets stronger. Others will find it is weaker. It all depends on what type of areas are brought into their new seat, or left out of it. Will it actually happen?  It might not - because it still has to be approved in Parliament. There have previously been reports of Tory and DUP MPs being against. And there\u0027s form for it failing - a previous boundary review had to be abandoned in 2013 after the Lib Dems withdrew support. There will be a vote in Parliament, but Theresa May\u0027s spokesman would not say if it will definitely take place before Christmas. The law only requires ministers to act as soon as may be - and doesn\u0027t set a timescale. WHICH SEATS WILL CHANGE The Press Association has carried out the following analysis of the proposals for England. It lists the greatest changes, based on constituency names axed and new. But please be aware the list comes with a health warning. Some constituencies are on the list but merely change their name, and in reality the MP who holds the seat is pretty safe. On the other hand, some constituencies that keep their names are not on the list - even though they will be changing. The changes are incredibly complicated and run to hundreds of pages so we can\u0027t list them all here. But you can use the Boundary Commission\u0027s interactive map if you want to know more.

Thousands of dogs are set to descend on Parliament as pet owners become the latest group to demand a second Brexit referendum.  Pooch-loving activists fear a pet passport scheme which allows them to take their animals to the EU will be suspended if there is a no-deal withdrawal. The scheme enables more than 250,000 animals a year to travel with their owners to the continent. Best for Britain spokesman Paul Butters: “No matter how you voted in the referendum, you did not vote to leave your beloved family pet languishing in kennels for weeks. “All this Brexit bad news must give us paws for thought.  “The Government are barking up the wrong tree.”  Animals rights campaigners will lead their dogs as they march on Westminster next month, amid claims quitting the bloc without a pact will trigger a shortage of vets.  Organiser Dominic Dyer said: “We know Brexit will be disastrous for the people of Britain but it could also be equally bad for our pets, “From a shortage of skilled vets and vet nurses, to rising costs for animal health and pet food products and even the end of the EU pet passport scheme, Brexit will be disastrous for the nations dogs and cats and other companion animals.  “If Brexit causes another recession on the scale of the financial crash of 2008, we can expect to see plunging living standards, forcing many people to give up their pets, leaving charities and shelters struggling to cope with the influx of animals in need of new homes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top mp gets interrogated tories","story":"NewsTop MP gets interrogated about the Tories\u0027 \u0027stupidest idea ever\u0027 and it\u0027s toe-curlingChloe Smith valiantly went in to bat for her plan to force all voters to show ID - a \"sledgehammer to crack a nut\".

Chloe Smith valiantly praised her plan to force all voters to show ID - despite campaigners arguing it\u0027s a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Authorities dealt with just 28 allegations of in-person voter fraud in 2017. Yet during a trial, 340 voters were turned away for not having ID in just five areas. The Constitution Minister was repeatedly tripped up by MPs as she defended the policy at an extraordinary hearing of the Commons Public Administration Committee. She admitted the trial cost almost \u0026pound2million said she has no idea how much the wider scheme will cost and even appeared to admit Labour will lose out. Here are 5 toe-curling moments we watched through our fingertips.  Ms Smith was very cross at the Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group that\u0027s pushing to scrap the scheme. She accused them of wildly inaccurate and misleading and scaremongering figures. But her own use of figures was interesting too. She insisted the 340 voters turned away for not having ID during the trial were a “very small number”, at 0.14% of those eligible to vote. Yet she also claimed in-person voter fraud was an obvious weakness in our democracy that could rob people\u0027s votes - even though the 28 allegations in 2017 amount to 0.000063% of votes. Asked about this discrepancy, she said: Either you care about small numbers or you don’t. Society should worry about small numbers either way, right? And therefore we should worry about any crime that has small numbers being committed. But as for the small number of 340 people turned away - 17,000 when scaled up nationally - she suggested it was fine not to let them vote. I think it is legitimate to ask the question... should they have been voting? she said.  It\u0027s been claimed Labour will lose out more than the Tories under the scheme - because poorer voters are less likely to have photo ID. So Ms Smith was asked by the committee chief, Tory Bernard Jenkin, if she\u0027d received any evidence one party will have an advantage over another under the new system. She replied: Um, yes, I think it’s fair to say, Sir Bernard - in the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate this point has been made. Um, and, I’m sorry to have to report it is the Labour party, um, that I think has this, er, problem. She added: I have put on record before that it is a case of double standards when that argument is made. Because in fact it’s the Labour party that already requires ID for example in their local party meeting processes and therefore it’s a little rich to object to it as a matter of policy for everyone else in the country. I think it’s quite distasteful actually if any party were to try to ‘own\u0027 a certain type of voter and say they may not have the free choice at elections to do what they wish to do with their vote.  It\u0027s not fully clear if she meant Labour will lose out, or it\u0027s Labour that  claimed  they\u0027ll lost out, but those are the words she said.   Ms Smith revealed the five trials of voter ID - along with three other trials involving postal votes - cost \u0026pound1.9million. She suggested this may not include publicity costs, thought to run to hundreds of thousands of pounds, which are still being totted up. 4. When she admitted she doesn\u0027t know how much more it will cost  Government documents have suggested the scheme could cost up to \u0026pound20million in a full general election. Ms Smith said she doesn\u0027t yet know how much it would cost. In fact, she said she doesn\u0027t even know how much the next round of trials will cost. Asked to confirm she\u0027s rolling the plan out across the country, despite not knowing what it\u0027ll cost, she said: “That’s right”. Sir Bernard frowned: It seems rather odd that you’ve committed to the policy without understanding the cost of the policy. 5.

Former councillor Allen Keyte, who chaired a local Conservative branch before his suspension, shared a picture of a woman wearing a niqab on a Tube escalator alongside the caption: “This is OFFENSIVE to real British people! “Like and share if you agree.” The image was originally posted by Britain First.  Another image, from Immigration UK, was of an apparent refugee taking a selfie on a beach. It was captioned: “Nothing says traumatised refugee like a grinning selfie took on the latest Samsung mobile phone.”  Mr Keyte posted them three years ago and they no longer appear to be on his Facebook page. But the Mirror has seen screen grabs of the posts. Challenged on Monday on why he posted the pictures, Mr Keyte said: “Why don’t you ring Boris Johnson?” before hanging up. The former Foreign Secretary sparked outrage last month when he wrote a newspaper article claiming women in burqas looked like bank robbers and letter boxes.  Mr Keyte was chairman of a new branch of the Conservative Party in Bishop’s Cleeve, until his suspension earlier. He was previously a Tewkesbury Borough Council for 20 years and on and Gloucestershire County Council for six years. He told his local paper Gloucestershire Live: “The items on Facebook are only informational on topics of concern to many people.  “For example refugees are supposed, under UN guidance, to go to the next safe country if their own country is not safe for them to live in. “These ‘refugees’ are in fact economic migrants which is an entirely different thing and not going to the next safe country. “The wearing of material over the face to hide or disguise is banned in France, Belgium, Holland and parts of Germany - and many others within Europe are considering the same.

Paramedic Julie Wade and emergency care assistant Catherine Whitehouse parked the ambulance across a local\u0027s parking space in Spalding, Lincolnshire.  And as they were leaving, they discovered a heartwarming note on the windscreen which had a \u0026pound5 note attached to it, Lincolnshire Live reports.  The note said: “You blocked my drive’ but it doesn’t matter because I wasn’t going out anyway. Enjoy your day – buy a coffee.”  Unfortunately, the crew never managed to get their coffee, due to it being too busy, but they are looking forward to getting one on their night shift, East Midlands Ambulance Service said. It comes after several notes have been left to ambulance crews across the country by people complaining their driveways have been blocked by life-saving paramedics.  One stranger in Surrey left a lovely note and a tenner for breakfast on one of the Tongham Ambulance Crews\u0027 ambulance in Camberley, Surrey Live reports.  The note read: Just wanted to say a massive thank you for being out at all hours of the day and night and being true heroes... I can\u0027t begin to imagine how hard your job must be so have some breakfast on me!... Once again, thank you so much! The note was signed by a friendly citizen and was left on the ambulance with a tenner attached for a well-deserved refreshment. Jonathan Murrell contacted the newspaper to say thanks to the mystery person.  He added that paramedic, Liam Morgan, and emergency care support worker, Samantha Finn, were 10 hours into their 12-hour night shift and it made their night. Elsewhere in Britain, a tongue-in-cheek note was spotted in Faversham, Kent. Community first responder Carol Lewis from South East Coast Ambulance Service saw a kind note pinned to the window of the team\u0027s vehicle after responding to an emergency call - with a tenner attached. The sweet note read: You\u0027re blocking our drive. No worries, buy a coffee when you can. Gary Turley, an ambulance crew member at the scene, said: The note was a really nice surprise, very generous and much appreciated... I’d like to thank whoever it was that left it. It was really appreciated. It had been a challenging shift and to find this halfway through was lovely.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grandad 62 battered six foot","story":"NewsGrandad, 62, battered by six-foot security guard while attending \u0027cruel\u0027 disability assessment with his wifeEXCLUSIVE: Keith Langham, 62, needed seven stitches to a head wound after an assault by Chris Bryan while accompanying his disabled wife to an assessmentShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJeremy Armstrong11:58, 11 SEP 2018Updated13:30, 11 SEP 2018NewsKeith Langham suffered major head injuries following an assault by a security guard \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA grandad of 62 was assaulted by a muscle-bound security guard after he took his disabled wife for a benefits assessment. Keith Langham was left with blood pouring from a head wound after helping wife Karen, 61, with the interview for her Personal Independence Payments. She was told that people like her ‘needed to learn to help themselves’ amid ugly scenes at her first appointment. It was carried out on behalf of Independent Assessment Services, formally known as ATOS, in Carlisle, Cumbria. At the second interview, Keith, who is 5ft 5in tall and 10-and-a-half stone, had to be taken to hospital after he was grabbed by powerfully-built six footer Chris Bryan, then aged 30.  He pushed him into a door then held Keith in a headlock so that he struggled to breath. The incident was recorded on Keith’s phone before police were called to the centre in Newcastle Business Park. Grandfather-of-two Keith had seven stitches in a head wound. He and his wife then faced the ordeal of giving evidence against Bryan, a ‘Boxercise’ personal trainer who was found guilty of assault by beating in May this year. Semi-retired Keith, a services manager said: “He was a very large guy, I would say he was about 6ft 4in tall and 16st, heavily built, shaven headed. He said he was security and we had to leave the building. But he was not wearing any ID. “I asked who he worked for and he told me he did not have to tell me and we had to leave. We were heading towards the reception when one of the nurses said ‘get them out through the fire doors’.”  He added: “I felt his breath on the back of my neck, he put one hand between my shoulder blades, the other in the small of my back and launched into me, pushing me into the door frame. “He then had me in a choke hold and you could hear me on audio saying ‘I am calm can you let me go’. It was unnecessary, cowardly, and disproportionate.”  Karen, who suffered a series of strokes in 2002 and walks with a stick, “went into meltdown”. “I was screaming at him to let him go,” she said. “He had him in a chokehold for about two minutes.” The couple, of Haltwhistle, Northumberland, now realise the second appointment had been ‘flagged’ by the assessors due to problems with their staff at the first interview.  “The whole process is insensitive to put it mildly, these checks are incredibly cruel.” added Karen. “But this was disgraceful.” Northumbria Police were called to the incident on Aug 18, 2017. Keith was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, where he received seven stitches in the head wound. Bryan, of Birtley, Co Durham, was found guilty of assault at North Tyneside Magistrates court after a trial. He was given a 12-month community order, with 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay \u0026pound620 in court costs, a \u0026pound85 victim surcharge, and \u0026pound150 compensation to Keith. He has appealed against conviction, and that is due to be heard before Newcastle crown court on Sept 28. He declined to comment. “My concern is the crown court case,” he said.

Tiffany Senara, 22, claims she made the grim discovery after moving into her new Staffordshire council house, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.  She says she had previously complained to the council about her garden being covered in broken glass and rubble, so took matters into her own hands. I was raking my back garden when I came across a shallow grave. I kept searching and have dug up 28 guinea pigs, Tiffany said. The first time I pulled out a puppy pad and the smell was horrendous. I\u0027m surprised the whole of Abbey Hulton couldn\u0027t smell it.  I\u0027ve stopped working on my garden now because I am dreading finding anymore. It has since emerged that the mum is living in the same property where the RSPCA found 42 dead guinea pigs last year. Tiffany claimed: The RSPCA has told me that because it has already prosecuted a person over this case there is nothing else they can do.  North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard last year how more than 130 animals - including cats, dogs , rabbits and guinea pigs - were found at the Blakelow Road council house after neighbours complained about smells coming from the property.  The entire house was covered in animal faeces and infested with rats.  A woman living at the property was handed a lifetime animal ban by magistrates. Her teenage daughter received a five-year animal ban. Following the discovery of more dead guinea pigs, an RSPCA spokesman said: Unfortunately we are unable to discuss complaints about specific people and what action may have been taken. We understand how frustrating this is for animal lovers but releasing information could prejudice a future prosecution or could lead to us being fined.

Now, as Nottinghamshire Live reports, a new study completed by Mom Junction has linked a baby\u0027s birth month to their future personality traits, showing which qualities are most common in people born at a certain time of the year.  You can find out what your baby could be like, or you can check the accuracy on your older loved ones. These are the traits associated with each month:  January   Hard working, organised and know how to get the job done. As children they seem older than their age as they are reliable and hardworking. A January baby finds it hard to express their feelings but can love deeply.  They are practical and ambitious, RSVP Live reports.   February  Free spirits who are original, energetic and do their own thing. They don’t conform but are quick learners who are hungry for knowledge and adventure. They are cool but can be cold in nature as they do not desire attention or affection. February babies make friends easily but don’t over think it. They love entertainment and fun.  March   Kind and caring - March babies know when others need comfort and attention. They are peace loving and reserved and very emotional but usually keep these emotions to themselves. They often forget about their own feelings in order to help others.  April  Very active and outgoing. Babies born in April want to do everything yesterday and are very busy. They are enthusiastic, fun and make great friends. The are very confident but maybe overpowering to some. Love activities, the outdoors, and can show lots of emotion from utter joy to anger.  May  Consistent and reliable. May borns like to keep lists and get things done. They are honest, stubborn and motivated. They love to travel and can be restless. May babies are attractive in personality and appearance.

Rude gentleman\u0027s club owner Amy Gwynn says the women who work there celebrate their beauty, confidence and power. The mum from Liverpool says both men and women are welcomed to enjoy adult-themed shows, including pole dance performances. Rude gentleman\u0027s club has been providing a \u0027sexy\u0027 service in Liverpool for almost a decade. And while it always took pride in being a \u0027glamorous\u0027 and \u0027exclusive\u0027 venue, Amy believes it\u0027s time for a switch-up.   Speaking to the Liverpool Echo , Amy said: After opening the business eight years ago it became apparent that the industry was still stigmatised with outdated attitudes towards who we are.  It is the aim of our brand to show the glamorous side of female entertainment. Every night our women take the spotlight to celebrate their beauty, confidence and power. Over the years, Amy said she has met some inspiring women and she wanted the club to best reflect them. Rude was previously based in the former Pleasure Rooms building on Duke Street but moved to a larger ‘super-club’ on the same street last year.  As well as giving the club a complete revamp, Amy also wanted to give Rude somewhat of a re-brand when it moved into the former Society nightclub. The 31-year-old said: In January last year we moved to our new super-club, now the largest in the North West, with a purpose-built stage where both men and women are welcomed to enjoy all our adult-themed shows from pole performances to fire shows. A mum to four daughters, Amy wants the new venue to be the best possible environment for her staff. She said: I felt it was important that the design process of our club was completely in the hands of women, from myself as a female boss, to teaming with Beth Begg Design, to consulting our girls at every stage. We believe we\u0027ve created a really special place for everyone to enjoy. To compliment the grandeur of our entertaining space, we now have our modern dressing room, toilet facilities, and on-site makeup room and make up artist. The response from our customers and our girls has been overwhelming and we are already in plans for Rude London. Amy started working with the girls aged just 22 describing it as \u0027empowering\u0027 and saying there was a strong \u0027culture of sisterhood\u0027 in the industry.

Detectives still searching for missing Madeleine have not uncovered any significant new leads in their latest trips to Portugal, where the toddler vanished in May 2007. It means Kate and Gerry McCann face another \u0027D-Day\u0027 where they fear the search for their daughter, codenamed Operation Grange, could be indefinitely suspended in the absence of fresh information.  A source close to the couple from Rothley in Leicestershire told the Mail Online: They have been here before. They simply have no idea if the search will abruptly come to an end or will carry on. It is a daunting prospect they face once more. The source added: Kate and Gerry are grateful to the politan Police for everything they have done over the years and hope of course that the inquiry into their daughter\u0027s abduction will continue if more funds are requested and made available. In March of this year the investigation into Madeleine\u0027s abduction was granted \u0026pound150,000 more with more than \u0026pound11m thought to have been spent on the 11-year-search.  In May the parents celebrated Maddie\u0027s 15th birthday. Kate and Gerry wrote: Happy 15th birthday Madeleine! on the official Find Maddie Campaign Facebook page. It was accompanied by a cherished, smiling photo of the missing girl, taken just days before she went missing in 2007. Alongside it is a green and yellow ribbon, symbolising hope.

But Meghan Markle doesn\u0027t seem to be having any troubles with her new family after marrying Prince Harry in May. She\u0027s been a big hit with the Queen, Camilla and brother-in-law William, and they\u0027re often seen laughing and joking together. And she\u0027s also becomes very close with another of Harry\u0027s relatives - and it\u0027s not an obvious friendship.  According to Vanity Fair, the Duchess of Sussex has a loving relationship with her new father-in-law Prince Charles. A source told the magazine the Royal Wedding was a huge turning point after Charles offered to walk Meghan down the aisle. They said: Charles showed so much love towards Harry and Meghan, and I think Harry will be eternally grateful to his papa for stepping in and giving Meghan\u0027s hand in marriage. The bond between them is very close. Meghan, Harry and Charles reportedly spent time over the summer dining, reading, and walking together.  The source added: Charles has been very supportive of Meghan and everything she is going through with her own father. He\u0027s got a real soft spot for her and thinks she\u0027s the best thing to have happened to Harry. After a break for the summer Meghan and Harry are back to royal duties with a packed calendar of events and engagements.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have both spoken about wanting to start a family, sparking huge excitement and bump watch every time they\u0027re seen out in public. And we\u0027re sure Prince George, Princess Charlotte and baby Louis would love a little cousin to play with. But despite sharing the same royal upbringing and living next door to each other, there will be one big difference between the royal children - their surnames.  George\u0027s official title is His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, and his full name is George Alexander Louis. But that probably doesn\u0027t fit on the school register. So it\u0027s likely he took on the name George Cambridge when he started school at St Thomas\u0027s in Battersea last year. Royal kids traditionally take their surnames from their parents\u0027 title.  Princes William and Harry did this when they were growing up, going by the surname Wales. Harry used this title when he was in the Army, serving as Officer Cadet Wales and then Captain Wales.  But this means Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s kids, if they decide to have them, will be known as something completely different.  If they continue the tradition, the little royals will use the surname Sussex.

Parents Elizabeth Wilkins and Erick Vanselow have gone on trial accused of cruelty after their son suffered critical injuries in an \u0027incident at home\u0027, the jury was told. One nurse told the trial the calmness of the mother was not normal. She said the mum told her that she could watch as medical staff drilled into the bone of the boy - because she was used to watching Holby and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE. Hospital staff found that the boy had suffered a fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and broken ribs. He spent several months in hospital and, now just over two-years-old, may have developmental problems, the court was told. The couple - who were both students at university and deny the charges - were accused in court of showing a \u0027unusual\u0027 lack of emotion as the boy battled for survival.  And a senior doctor has told a court she was concerned about the delay in taking the three-month-old to a GP more than ten hours after he suffered a serious head injury, the Plymouth Herald reports.  Plymouth Crown Court heard how Vanselow told a consultant paediatrician he had accidentally dropped the infant on to a plastic kitchen counter early that morning. But the Crown Prosecution Service, opening the case, said that neither the head injuries, nor the rib fractures could have been caused accidentally. Jo Martin, QC, said that the baby was assaulted by either mum, dad or both parents on several occasions two years ago at the former couple\u0027s home in Plymouth, Devon. Vanselow, now 30, was then studying for a masters in International Relations at the University of Plymouth. Wilkins, 23, was also about to start the final year of a law degree at the university. They have both been named after a judge lifted a court order.  The court has heard the boy was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, 17 days before his admission, with bloodshot eyes. An expert has already told the court those injuries were mostly likely caused by the chest being crushed. Sister Sophie Brock, nurse in charge of the section of the A\u0026ampE department which admitted the boy, said Wilkins was very calm when the ambulance arrived at about 4.30pm. She added that staff struggled to find a vein to insert an intravenous drip into the child and so had to drill into the bone marrow. Mrs Brock described the procedure as distressing to watch. She added that it was not fair for a parent to stay and so Wilkins was asked to step outside. Mrs Brock said: Her reply was that she watched Holby and 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE, which was a little bit of a strange thing to say. Piers Norsworthy, for Wilkins, asked the witness: When you are presented with a very sick baby, one imagines the worst thing you could see is a panicky, distracting mother? Mrs Brock replied: It does not help but it is normal and we are able to deal with that. Derriford consultant paediatrician Thynn Aung said that she spoke to the parents together to get a history of what had happened that day. She said that Vanselow told her he had dropped the baby so the infant had hit the left side of his head against a plastic kitchen counter during a feed at 4am that morning. An ambulance paramedic had earlier told the court that the father had said he dropped the boy about a foot.

The art dealer, who Diana became \u0027obsessed\u0027 with in 1992, died at home in France. A married father-of-three, he was a close friend of Prince Charles. It\u0027s thought he began an affair with Diana in 1992, after her dad Earl Spencer passed away. Hoare was 16 years older than Princess Diana. A former bodyguard said he had once spotted him semi-naked behind a potted bay tree in a Kensington Palace corridor, smoking a cigar.  Hoare was allegedly discovered by the Princess’ former royal protection officer, Ken Wharfe. But he never publicly admitted to the affair. His affair with the princess ended when his French born wife Diane threatened divorce, according to reports.  Princess Diana had become infatuated with Hoare and once told her confidante, Lady Bowker, she dreamed of living in Italy with him, according to the Daily Mail. After the affair cooled off, Diana reportedly admitted in a 1995 Panorama interview she\u0027d called him sometimes, over a period of up to nine months, but not in an obsessive manner. Hoare began as an art history student at the Sorbonne.

Vinehall School, in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, ran the advert in a number of local magazines, showing a student daydreaming about how his father cannot afford to own a Jaguar like the headmaster, but drives a Volvo instead. It has since been branded \u0027tone deaf\u0027 by shocked social media users - while the boarding school\u0027s head has apologised for such an unfortunate error of judgement. The ad reads: The Volvo Estate - your Dad\u0027s pride and joy - suddenly swung left into a long drive. You saw Open Day signs and your eyes widened. You pointed to the beautiful dark blue Jaguar parked by a sign saying \u0027Headmaster\u0027s Parking\u0027. You said you wished your Dad had one.  Your Dad looked wistful, the Volvo had to do a few years yet. It continues: You did well at Vinehall and have fond memories. You were very successful in business. You bought your Dad a Jaguar when he retired. You think every child should go along to the Open Days. Maybe they will buy their Dad a Jaguar one day too. It sparked outrage among some Internet users. Bestselling British novelist Judy Astley said: How very bizarre. Who\u0027d want to send their child to a school where the core values are entirely about acquiring material crap? Mark Owen added: Heartening to see Vinehall School taking some well-deserved stick on social media for this appalling, elitist and p***-poorly-executed ad.  If you\u0027re the type to reckon someone\u0027s worth by measure of their wealth, give your kid a chance to be a better human and send \u0027em elsewhere! Another said: How wonderfully tone deaf! A school is chosen for quality of education, pupil experience, school environment, subject choice, location and possibly Ofsted rating. The car the headmaster supposedly drives is utterly irrelevant. And Mark fumed: I\u0027d never send a child to this school. Completely devoid of a moral compass. Vinehall is a prep school founded in 1938 which caters for children between the ages of two and 13. Last night, headmaster Mr Powis issued an apology, saying: I very deeply regret the widespread offence caused by the recent open day advertisement.  It was wholly misguided, and should never have seen the light of day. I must stress it is in no way a reflection of the ethos of our school and the worthwhile work we do here. We are taking a long hard look at how it came to be created in the first place, but as head, I must take full responsibility for its appearance, and can only apologise for such an unfortunate error of judgement. Vinehall prides itself on being a friendly, inclusive place, where the values of modesty and broad-mindedness are at the forefront of our guidance and teaching. It is not the first \u0027error of judgement\u0027 from a fee-paying school.

But Deacon made the sickening comment that she enjoyed it though.  The woman’s son, who was in the house at the time, fetched two knives, told Deacon to leave and called police, prosecutor Richard Bennett told Teesside Crown Court.

As we waited for the supervisor I also caught a very bad allergic reaction. Bed bugs are blood-sucking insects that live in cracks and crevices in and around beds, the NHS says.

It was the most devastating terror attack to take place on US soil. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 75, were forced to crash into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane, American Airlines Flight 77 was flown into the Pentagon in Washington and the last, United Airlines Flight 93, was flown into a field in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania as passengers and crew fought to regain control. Plane passengers, office workers, emergency service personnel and bystanders were all victims of a truly heinous act.  The images of that terrible day will remain with us always - but, so too, will the words spoken in the immediate aftermath and the following years from notable figures, families and survivors of that fateful day. These are just some of the powerful 9/11 quotes . The attacks of September 11th were intended to break our spirit. Instead we have emerged stronger and more unified. - Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, speaking on September 31st, 2001 No day shall erase you from the memory of time. - A quote from Virgil\u0027s Aeneid, which adorns the 9/11 Memorial Museum  What do I tell the pilots to do? - Barbara Olson, who was on Flight 77, asked husband General Theodore Olson for advice We\u0027re young men. We\u0027re not ready to die. - Kevin Cosgrove, who was on the 105th floor of the South Tower, spoke to the emergency services moments before it collapsed Numerous civilians in the stairwells, numerous burn victims are coming down. We\u0027re trying to send them down first... we\u0027re still heading up. - Captain Patrick Brown of Ladder 3 and his company were climbing the stairwell of the North Tower just half an hour before the first collapse  If we learn nothing else from this tragedy, we learn that life is short and there is no time for hate. - Sandy Dahl\u0027s husband, Captain Jason Dahl, was the pilot of Flight 93 “My older brother John lived [his life] in Technicolor. … When he walked in the door, the whole house lit up. And I’m sure heaven lit up when he got there too.” - Anthoula Katsimatides, speaking at the World Trade Center site in 2005 “My son, firefighter Leon Smith Jr., who was the sunshine of my life. He gave his life so that others could live.

Millions of Americans are busy preparing for what could become one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit the east coast in decades, with mandatory evacuations already issued for parts of three states. Hurricane Florence is getting stronger as it travels over the Atlantic and could become a Category 5 storm today with winds up to 140 mph. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm is busy strengthening as it makes its way to the US and is shaping up to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane by the time it hits on Thursday.  It is then forecast to close in on North or South Carolina on Thursday, hitting a stretch of coastline that is vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate change. Make your plans now, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster urged residents during a news conference yesterday. Presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina. Henry McMaster has ordered more than 1 million residents along his state\u0027s coastline to leave starting at noon on Tuesday. This is a serious storm and it\u0027s going to affect the entire state he added. Early today, Florence was centred about 975 miles east-south-east of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and moving west-north-west at nearly 15mph. The storm is currently picking up speed around Bermuda and will be moving between there and the Bahamas today and into Wednesday before it hits the Carolinas.  The storm\u0027s potential path also includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous pig farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons. At least 250,000 more people were due to be evacuated from the northern Outer Banks in North Carolina on Tuesday after more than 50,000 people were ordered on Monday to leave Hatteras and Ocracoke, the southernmost of the state\u0027s barrier islands. North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland governors have declared states of emergency. Please be prepared, be careful and be SAFE! President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday evening. And the hurricane could make landfall possibly as a category 3 or higher on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, forecasters said. Landfall could be made between South Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday, according to NHC predictions.

Kaylee Hollister says the 26 year age gap between her and lover Matthew Taylor is no obstacle, saying they have insane chemistry. But not everyone is convinced about the relationship, with some labelling the older man a \u0027paedophile\u0027. Kaylee, a jewellery designer and bar tender, says she was \u0027instantly attracted\u0027 to Matthew and that they have \u0027insane chemistry.\u0027 Her boyfriend, meanwhile, who is an IT administrator and artisan, says he was attracted by \u0027her confidence and poise and also her honesty. She is so genuine and kind.\u0027  Kaylee and Matthew initially met on Facebook via a \u0027friend suggestion\u0027 and chatted as friends for several months. At first Matthew just saw her as an online pal. He said: She was young and involved and had a kid with someone, so I had no aspirations for her at that time. I found her attractive - what man wouldn\u0027t? - but I never had any ideas that we\u0027d be anything more than casual acquaintances with shared interests. However, fate intervened when the pair attended the same local gig.  Matthew said: I remember being there and standing next to a couple of friends watching one of the bands play when this feeling came over me, telling me to look to my right. There she was! I actually felt her walk into the room! I walked over to her, said \u0027hi!\u0027 and we started talking. I was fascinated with her. Her bright smile, her dark hair, her light demeanor.  We talked about our mutual interests and seemed to enjoy each other\u0027s company very much. We spent about the next hour hanging out and talking to each other and other mutual friends. He added: She left me with a sort of glow that I carried with me for the rest of the night. Kaylee was equally smitten, saying: It was in our very first meeting that we both knew we would be in each other\u0027s lives. After the gig Kaylee messaged Matthew and the two soon became inseparable, with Kaylee drawn to his perceptiveness, intelligence and the fact that he is unconditionally himself.  She said: There will always be a part of me that feels there was some type of divine intervention that allowed us to come to be. But not everyone has been as thrilled about their relationship as the couple themselves, with some people calling the 50-year-old a paedophile and others accusing Kaylee of having daddy issues. Matthew said: I\u0027m actually thankful for these comments because these were people who I believed were my friends and now it\u0027s become clear that they aren\u0027t. So I, in turn, was able to cut them off.  Although he rarely responds to such accusations, calling them \u0027invalid and irrelevant\u0027, when he does he says he reminds people that \u0027she is an adult in her 20s with a child, just like a few of them were at one time, and how they would probably have considered themselves adults as well.\u0027 Kaylee says the negative comments don\u0027t bother her much. She explained: I\u0027ve had younger guys say things to me in some sad attempt at making themselves look better, or women telling me that \u0027I must have had daddy issues\u0027 in order to be this way.  But what I take from it is that happy couples are a pretty rare thing because people are so shallow and that some people will try to pull the good energy out of those that radiate. Although the couples\u0027 families are now close, Kaylee\u0027s mother initially struggled to accept the fact her daughter was dating a 50-year-old, not least because the two are close in age. Kaylee said: I also feel she wanted to make sure I was safe and secure with this person. Matthew added: Her dad was fine with it. He was just happy that she was being taken care of by a responsible man. Her mom wasn\u0027t very good about it at first but she and I are cool now that she\u0027s had some more exposure to me.

Whether you\u0027re one of those people, or someone who thinks passing wind is hilariously funny, you will on average produce half a litre of fart gas a day.   If you are disgusted by this idea and try your hardest to hold the gas in and not fart in front of others, you\u0027re not alone, but you also could be suffering some nasty consequences, reports Coventry Live .  According to experts if you hold a fart in the gas can recirculate around the body and come out from some shocking places.   Clare Collins, a professor in nutrition and dietetics at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, writes for The Conversation to explain what farts are and what happens if you hold them in.  She said: The next time you feel a large volume of intestinal gas getting ready to do what it does, try to move to a more convenient location. Whether you make it there or not, the best thing for your digestive health is to just let it go. A build up of intestinal gas can trigger abdominal distension, with some gas reabsorbed into the circulation and exhaled in your breath. Holding on too long means the build up of intestinal gas will eventually escape via an uncontrollable fart.  She added that is could also lead to a condition called diverticulitis, where small pouches develop in the gut lining and become inflamed. However the evidence linking the two isn\u0027t extensive. If everything is ticking along nicely, the average person farts around 15 times a day.

In an act of incredible selflessness, residents in the rural Newfoundland town of Gander threw open their doors and played host to thousands of airline passengers left stranded when US airspace was shut down. The area – which at the time had a population of just 10,000 and only 550 hotel rooms – suddenly faced an influx of terrified strangers with no luggage, nowhere to go and no idea where they were. As the full horror of events in New York and Washington DC unfolded, air traffic controllers ordered 38 planes to land immediately at the remote Gander airport – a former North Atlantic hub which is now something of a 1960s relic.  The airport, originally built as a military facility, was the only option for many large planes that need a long runway to touch down despite rarely handling commercial jets. In a stark contrast one air traffic controller recalled seeing an Air France Boeing 747 bigger than the airport terminal”. After passengers disembarked they faced heightened security checks amid fears that more terrorists could have been preparing attacks. But then as thousands of passengers filed out of the airport with nowhere to go, something miraculous happened. As the Red Cross and Salvation Army scrambled to organise beds in schools and church halls, families for miles around emptied their fridges and prepared food.  After radio announcements calling for local help, businesses and residents supplied everything from toothbrushes to spare underwear. A communications company set up phone banks for the passengers to use while TV firms wired up schools and church halls so those stranded could follow the terrifying events in New York. Classes were also cancelled at local schools to free up computers and showers with students volunteering to help people contact their worried families using email. The town’s mayor Claude Elliott told the New York Times: We\u0027re used to helping people. “I guess our biggest problem was trying to explain to people where they were.  Nearby towns also braced for the influx of passengers. In Twillingate, a small island off the Newfoundland coast, locals readied sandwiches and soup for hundreds then drove an hour and a half to deliver the food to those coming off the planes. Even those with special dietary requirements were catered for – kosher food was sourced for an orthodox Jewish family while a group of Moldovan refugees who spoke no English and were part of a religious sect were looked after by church members.  But while the locals did not ask for anything in return for their astonishing generosity, the passengers repaid the hospitality by setting up scholarship funds and making donations of tens of thousands of dollars to the towns.  One passenger wrote to a local newspaper saying: “The people of Lewisporte and the Salvation Army fed us three meals a day and provided countless blankets, toothbrushes and toiletries for the passengers on that flight. “The elementary school next to the Salvation Army building canceled classes for its children to provide us with access to the much-needed shower stall and the computer classroom for us to e-mail home. “When we finally received word of the plane\u0027s clearance for leaving, we said goodbye with bittersweet memories of a group of people of unlimited generosity.

The child, from Vietnam, started showing symptoms and seeping blood three to four times a day while preparing for her exams a few months ago. She was initially diagnosed with a skin infection and given a course of medication, but the problem continued. Doctors also put the strange phenomenon down to stress, but have since diagnosed the girl with an ultra-rare condition.  Medics at the Quy Hoa National Leprosy Dermatology Hospital believe that the child, whose identity is being withheld, has hematidrosis. Hospital director Vu Tuan Anh said just one in 10,000,000 were affected by the phenomenon. “It is characterised by blood oozing from skin,” he said. “The bleeding is due to the rupture of the very small blood vessels of the skin. “The cause of hematidrosis is not well known, but factors include increased vascular pressure, inflammation of the vessels of the skin, bleeding disorders, menstruation and high blood pressure. “Fear and intense emotional stress could also play a role in the cause of the disease, and symptoms may occur spontaneously or after emotional stress.” Some claim the illness could account for the Biblical ‘Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane’, where Jesus is said to have sweated blood. According to scripture, Jesus sweated blood after accepting that he would be betrayed, having pleaded with God, “the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak”.

George Ragozin, dubbed the \u0027crazy Russian\u0027, offers trophy-seeking foreigners the chance to go on a safari and slaughter a range of beasts from elephants to lions. Included in the shocking \u0027packages\u0027 - which cost up to \u0026pound421,000 - is accommodation, food, beer and wine, plus a daily “washing service”. Prices start at 5,000 USD  for a 10-day safari that includes hunting wildebeest and zebra, 21,000  for a male and female lion, and 34,000  for a fortnight of “leopard baiting”.  More expensive packages are 55,000  for five days hunting white rhino or a 12-day elephant shoot. The father-of-three also offers a seven-day trip to stalk and kill a black rhinoceros, a critically endangered species, for 550,000 . The costs do not include chartering aircraft, firearms and ammunition, nor the shipping of trophies and tipping his staff. Despite this, he claims his trips are fully booked until 2020. Ragozin insists his hunting expeditions in South Africa - where he is based - along with safaris in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Burkina Faso and Namibia are all licensed and legal. He came under the spotlight in Russia in recent days after a critic claimed he was seeking to woo children to hunting, even though there is no current advertisement for such underage safaris on his web links. Pictures show the businessman after kills with two of his daughters, Ksenia, now 20, and Dana, 19, when they were children.  Ksenia appears to have been just 13 in a picture with a blue wildebeest, while Dana is seen at a slightly younger age with a gemsbok and a common warthog. Critic Maxim Tikhonov posted: “Discovered some George Ragozin who …came up with a creative idea to teach hunting to children starting from the age of eight. 5 per bullet.” Ragozin hit back: “Hey you, listen…” followed by a barrage of Russian slang, finishing: “I’ll come for you - just wait.” One South African source reported: “Elephant populations are down 30 per sent in the last 10 years. “So why is hunting them still allowed? “A hundred years ago, the population of African Elephants stood at 10 million. “That figure is now a miserly 400,000.”  But Ragozin has loyal supporters not only among Russians but also Americans, Germans, Spaniards, Slovaks and Slovenians, he said. In one video, Ragozin is called the “embodiment” of Russian hunting pride in Africa. He is “a legend who is loved, respected and admired all over the trophy world, it says. “Foreigners jokingly call him a crazy Russian. “He is a highly goal-oriented person in what he does. “He\u0027s very decisive and persistent in achieving ambitious goals in trophy hunting.” An earlier picture shows him with close Vladimir Putin ally Dmitry Rogozin, currently head of the Russian Space Agency and formerly vice prime minister. Ragozin set up his hunting business 15 years ago and it now boasts a 1.5 million  turnover. “I am Moscow born and bred,” he said.  “After school I continued my family tradition and entered the surgical department at Perviy Moscow State Medical Sechenov Institute. “I was really keen on becoming a doctor, but receiving a salary of 300 USD was so humiliating. “I married during my student years and there was no way I could feed family with such income. “ He said “you’ve got to play by the local rules” to operate in Africa and boasts that he now has his own hunting estates covering up to 15,000 hectares. “The hunting ‘fashion’ changes year to year,” he said. “Some time ago antelope hunting was super popular. “Now this type of hunting ....is in no demand. The top interest now is dangerous animals and very expensive packages ranging from 50,000  to 700,000  per one safari.”  He started a 120-animal zoo near his home and hunting ground in the Limpopo province of South Africa - larger in size than Moscow Zoo. He admits it is loss-making but claims hunting leads to animal conservation - and he criticises ecological groups for allegedly failing to help animals in the way they claim. ‘Not a single green or eco organisation offered a hand in running this zoo,” he said. “I take all these organisations with a fair bit of skepticism, as to my mind they work a lot more for the public than for nature. “I believe that hunting in conservation and that hunters take much better care of nature than anyone else. “One example: when South Africa legalised trophy hunting, the number of animals grew eight times.  “Taking care of animals is priority of any hunting business. “The link is obvious - the more animals, the better business. This is why hunters all around the world are the best donors.” Ragozin has a professional hunter’s license for dangerous game, and is a member of the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa, Safari Club International  and the International Professional Hunters Association . He was backed today by trophy hunter Sergey Yastrzhembsky, 64, former spokesman to Putin and his predecessor Boris Yeltsin. “South Africa is one of the brightest and most convincing examples of how a properly organised trophy hunting can become a highly profitable business,” he said.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9637ddc723d.jpg ","title":"chrissie hynde backed after calling for monstrosity block next to dundee va to be torn down","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPretenders singer Chrisse Hynde has been backed after calling for a controversial office block next to V\u0026ampA Dundee to be \u0026#8216torn down\u0026#8217.The star said the under-construction site \u0026#8220distracted\u0026#8221 her from her performance at Slessor Gardens on Sunday.Hynde told BBC Scotland: \u0026#8220In the daylight I noticed this quite beautiful building in the background, which I didn\u0026#8217t realise is the V\u0026ampA building, and this horrible carcass going up in front of it.\u0026#8220It was actually distracting me from what I was trying to do.\u0026#8220I was walking down Union Street there and I saw the V\u0026ampA again, a really beautiful vista of it and this monstrosity that\u0026#8217s totally obliterating the view of that beautiful building.\u0026#8220I would have it torn down.

I would like to pay tribute to the inspiration, energy and hard work of Scottish Rugby Chief Executive, Mark Dodson, and his Chief Operating Officer, Dominic McKay – both are true leaders in Scottish sport.”“This decision is about what was best for Scottish football and our members. It is about the future of football in Scotland.“I would also like to thank everyone who has been part of this process and to recognise the enormous generosity of Lord Haughey.“Finally, it has also been a hugely challenging time for Queen’s Park, Hampden Park Limited and all of the people who will be directly affected by this decision. We appreciate all their efforts to reach an agreement today and look forward to working with them to shape the future and continue to develop a national stadium that we can all be proud of.”Scottish FA Chief Executive Ian Maxwell said: “I would first of all like to offer my thanks to Dominic McKay and his team at Scottish Rugby. They have been impressive throughout the process and I would like to continue to build that relationship. There is a lot we can learn from each other.“Today is a big day for Scottish football. Hampden Park has been the spiritual home of Scottish football for over 100 years it has been central to our sport’s identity in this country. But today’s decision is about the future, not the past.“Our mission is to inspire a nation to love the game and having a home that we can call our own is an important part of that. It will enable us to drive investment into the game and give us the best chance to improve football in Scotland.“While we are now committed to Hampden Park we also recognise that it needs to change. We have heard the fans’ views throughout the process and agree with them that we need to improve access, transport links and the overall experience. We are committed to doing that.“With all the commitments that have been made to the Scottish FA and Hampden Park Limited throughout this process, taking ownership of the Hampden Park site will create the potential to transform the home of Scottish football for the benefit of Scottish football fans. Ownership really will change the game. We look forward to working with all interested parties to achieve an exciting and fan-friendly vision for Hampden Park.“With that in mind, we need all of Scotland to pull together to make it Scotland’s national stadium.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/09/Driver-steering-wheel-stock.jpg ","title":"driver reported after honda car speeds at 145mph on local road","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA driver has been reported after a Honda vehicle reached 145mph on a local road.Police reported a motorist to the Procurator Fiscal after a car was seen driving at double the speed limit on the A92.Officers observed the silver vehicle at around 10.50pm on Friday September 7, between the Redhouse and Bankhead roundabouts in Glenrothes.Officers stopped the vehicle and a 24 year old man has been reported for dangerous driving.This follows another driver being reported, after the Safety Camera Unit detected a red Volkswagen driving at 141mph on Sunday September 2 near Cowdenbeath.Inspector Andy Mather of Fife Road Policing Unit said: \u0026#8220Speed limits are in place to assist in making our roads safer.\u0026#8220Driving at speeds which are grossly in excess of the maximum speed limit is simply dangerous.

I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9637366d044-846x564.jpg ","title":"new look as residents to north east of dundee move out of the shadows","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhat does a typical Dundonian look like? What do they do each day and how do they feel about their area?In the seventh of an eight-part series, we aim to paint an up-to-date picture of how the city’s people live, based on the results of a new survey.Dundee’s most recent citizens’ survey was carried out last year and local area results are now available.Today, Jon Brady takes a look at the North East, where locals were asked about their lifestyles.The North East is home to some of the city’s newest neighbourhoods – places such as Mill o’ Mains and Whitfield.They are new, in that they are recent in comparison with some centuries-old parts of Dundee – but they show scars of regeneration gone wrong in years past.Say the words “skarne blocks” to a long-term North East resident and it’s likely some will remember them fondly – while others will associate the flats with a long decline into crime and deprivation.However, the local authority has set out long-term rejuvenation plans across the North East.And the effect of those plans, from new housing schemes to modern community centres, has left a positive impression on many of the area’s residents.While 65% of locals asked said they hadn’t seen any change in the area in the last five years, another 17% said it had got better – a higher proportion than any other area of Dundee.Half of those upbeat thinkers said it was down to new housing – others said the area looked tidier, and that it had been improved overall in recent years.But while most folk are happy with their local council and other services, one in 10 think the rubbish collections could be better.And much like other parts of Dundee, some think that roads, pavements and street lighting are in need of improvement.As one of the furthest-out corners of Dundee it might not be surprising to learn that three-quarters of households in the ward have access to at least one car to get about.But locals are environmentally minded too, with two thirds taking the bus at least a few times a month, if not more, and leaving the car at home.Half of all locals have been to the cinema at least once in the last year, and a third have been to see some live music.However, the ward’s rejuvenated sense of community is still in its early stages –half of locals who haven’t got involved in area events say they didn’t because “they weren’t really interested”.But for the North East – an area once a byword for deprivation and drug problems – things are largely looking up.Almost nine in 10 locals rate their health as “very good” or “good”, with two thirds of those surveyed exercising at least once a week.Three quarters have either never smoked, or used to but have kicked the habit.Meanwhile, 58% say they “often” feel optimistic about the future, and 39% say they feel the same “some of the time” – and feel either “very” or “fairly” safe.Jim Dall, 67, said people in the North East loved where they lived – and he knew how to prove it. “I always think you know about an area by looking at the gardens – they’re all well looked-after around here.“There’s no jungles to pick your way through here,” he said.Ex-forces man Joe Dumycz, 60, said: “It used to be you could leave your door unlocked but not anymore.“But the area is getting better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b963815b248d-769x564.jpg ","title":"return of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the

current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016. Currently out of a job, compensation wouldn\u0026#8217t be a problem for Dundee owner Tim Keyes.Second, on 25 votes, was David Hopkin. However, the poll was held immediately prior to the former Livingston manager starting a new post in charge of Bradford City so would now be out of the frame.Many others called for Dundee legend Jim Duffy to return for a third spell in charge of the club. With 22 votes, the 59-year-old was the third most desired manager. Duffy has twice led The Dee to Hampden finals and was in charge during the period of administration in 2003. Duffy has been out of management since leaving Greenock Morton in April.Former Scotland manage Gordon Strachan, ex Dundee United striker Jim McIntyre, St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright and new signing Kenny Miller were also touted as potential successors to McCann at Dens Park.\u0026nbspFull list:Robbie Neilson: 28 votesDavid Hopkin: 25Jim Duffy: 22Gordon Strachan: 20Jim McIntyre: 16John Hughes: 10Tommy Wright: 9Kenny Miller: 8Peter Houston: 6Jimmy Boyle: 4Jocky Scott: 3Barry Smith: 3Alan Stubbs: 3Steve Clarke: 2Temuri Ketsbaia: 2Ally McCoist: 2James McPake: 2Georgi Nemsadze: 2Mick McCarthy: 2Paul Lambert: 2Ian Cathro: 1Dave Martin: 1Jim Long: 1Lee Clark: 1Rab Douglas: 1Walter Smith: 1Stewart McCall: 1Stewart Petrie: 1Charlie Adam: 1Paul Hartley: 1Fabian Caballero: 1Pat Nevin: 1Morgan Wieghorst: 1Owen Coyle: 1Joe Jordan: 1\u0026nbspOf the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time as\u0026nbsp80%1,297 no312 yes1609\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1daf5c232.jpg ","title":"va dundee these lucky folk won the tele competition to see the new museum before it opens","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWe can announce the 40 winners of the Tele\u0026#8217s V\u0026ampA Dundee competition.Our once-in-a-lifetime competition included:ANDWe can now reveal that the following 30 people each won a pair of tickets for this prize after entering via our print edition.Thomas MitchellCharles DelaneyHenry McFadyenJohn HillElizabeth BellshawJennifer SwanPatrick MurrayGillian ScrimgeourJudy CarlinGemma BeattiePatricia BradyGeorge StobbieOona WebsterEmma-Jane MatherCarol ThomsonEdward HockleyGraeme SaundersErin GrantLeanne MaillieKaren OmelaszLynne ShepherdCatherine BarnettRobert MorningPatricia WyllieElizabeth GlasseyValerie MAckieIrene HastieMarilyn PalmigianiKelsey GreigJohn StevensonThe following 10 people each won a pair of tickets for this prize after entering online.Lauren FairlieMandy DeansBecky ReidBen WightonGail FechlieWendy ScullinJamie GordonGina AdamsMichelle MaxwellSusanne WardCongratulations!Win tickets for V\u0026ampA Dundee opening weekend\" src=\"https:www.eveningtelegraph/winvatickets/embed/#?secret=8IemCvQ5VK\" data-secret=\"8IemCvQ5VK\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Win tickets for V\u0026ampA Dundee opening weekend\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening \" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"book-your-christmas-party-venue-at-one-of-these-five-festive-spots","story":"                          Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and if he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that. He should not try to enforce his moral objection on everyone else.\"Eastgate Shopping Centre has given its permission for the march to start at Falcon Square.The main event hub will be at Eden Court

UK using a gift card developed by former Highland resident Colin Munro and his company Miconex.Perth, the West End district of Glasgow, Sheffield and Cardiff are among the locations which have set up their own schemes.Some 70 businesses, including national chains and local independents, have signed up to the Elgin gift card.However, Elgin Embrace manager Gill Neill warned that a successful gift card scheme required a large initial investment.\"We did it on behalf of all our members because it is an incredibly expensive programme to put together,\" she said.\"Set up costs are in the region of \u0026pound20,000, so you will find that most of the town gift cards are being run by business improvement districts on behalf of their membership.\"The businesses in the town have been really, really responsive and really positive, but I think a big part of that is we are covering the costs.\"I strongly suspect that if we had not and had been asking people to pay, you would not have had the same uptake.\"The initiative has also been well received by shoppers in the town.\"The public see it as a very positive thing,\" she added.\"Rather than being given a specific gift card that they use in one shop, they get an Elgin Gift Card that they can used in one of the 70 places in the town.\"They can use it to buy clothes, get their hair done, have a meal or put it towards a holiday or buying furniture.\"People are still very positive about embracing the Shop Local message and we hope this will encourage people to perhaps visit businesses they have never used before.\"From the point of

The bridge will also provide the \u0026lsquomissing link\u0026rsquo in east/west walking and cycle routes across the city.\"Thanks to additional funding provided by the Scottish Government through Sustrans Scotland\u0027 Community Links scheme, we are now able to award this contract and look forward to having the bridge in place within the next year.\"Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01243000/01243731.jpg","title":"New deputy appointed in SNP shake up","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW deputy leader of Highland Council\u0027 opposition SNP group has been elected after an Inverness councillor stepped down from the role last week due to health reasons.Councillor Ian Cockburn  replaces Councillor Richard Laird , who has also left the post of chairman of the audit and scrutiny committee.Cllr Cockburn will relinquish his role as SNP whip, handing the reins to Councillor Karl Rosie .SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \"Again, I pay tribute to Richard who served as deputy leader for five years or more and worked well with everyone.

While they are both different in how they play, both have a fantastic attitude, a desire to learn and to play for the team they have always supported.“That determination, along with their abilities will help them to hopefully become a regular in our first team if they keep working hard.”Campbell himself said: “I am delighted to get it done. As soon as I heard about the offer on the table, I was never not going to sign it. It was just a case of reading the terms and conditions and then putting pen to paper.“It is a little bit of a different situation between Bruce and myself because he was coming to the end of his contract. I still had a few years left on mine, but this now gives me more security. For the next few years I can get my head down and work hard and focus on trying to get as much game time as possible.“It has been a good start to the season for me personally. I have been involved with every first team game apart from the Hibernian one at Easter Road. It is good for me at my age to be involved with the first team squad.“Everyone wants to play for the first team and I am no exception.

Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%. Ice hockey was at 4%, up from 3%. Only 1% of those polled over 55 named soccer as their favourite sport while the figure was 11% between those aged 18-34.It is expected soccer will surpass baseball in popularity.The rise of soccer in the United States also came despite the national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia – the first time they had not been at the finals since 1986.The MLS recently signed an historic eight-year TV deal with ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision worth 720m with games now broadcast in 140 countries.“You look at some of the clubs out there in the MLS and what they are achieving and the fan experience that they are able to deliver,” said Wicks.“There is a lot we can learn and we have to be cognisant of that. There are wider opportunities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council unanimously agrees to remove aung san suu kyi plaque in aberdeen park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncillors have unanimously voted to destroy a plaque honouring a controversial Asian leader in the city.Lord Provost Barney Crockett said it was no longer right to have the plaque to Aung San Suu Kyi amid accusations she has ignored violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.Council officers will investigate replacing it with a new plaque dedicated to all the people of Myanmar in the struggle for human rights.The plaque was put up in Hazlehead Park alongside a jasmine plant at the request of Amnesty International 10 years ago.The 73-year-old leader of Myanmar – formerly Burma – lived under house arrest for years for her pro-democracy activism and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.She has been accused of failing to speak out over violence against the Rohingya people in her role as state counsellor.Some 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the violence targeting them after attacks by Rohingya militants killed a dozen members of the security forces.Investigators working for the UN’s top human rights body said last week that genocide charges should be brought against senior Burma military officers over the crackdown.Last month Ms Suu Kyi had her Freedom of Edinburgh award revoked.Other cities including Glasgow, Newcastle and Oxford have also acted to strip her of similar honours.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"great charter dinner approved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA civic dinner will be held next year to mark a medieval agreement between a king and the people of Aberdeen – despite concerns from opposition councillors.The 700th anniversary event, which was approved by councillors yesterday, will mark the creation of the Great Charter, granted by King Robert the Bruce in 1319. It was signed after the city sheltered him during his days as an outlaw from the English.Lord Provost Barney Crockett, who called for the council to hold the event, said the “momentous anniversary” should be marked by a “dinner in the first instance”, with citizens from all of the city’s 13 wards invited.He added: “It’s important we do it in a way that echoes our past.“Our link with Robert the Bruce is an important one and we should mark it in a dignified way.“Our citizens may want to do other things that might be part of a general celebration but we should have a dignified event.”SNP group leader Stephen Flynn instead called for council officers to provide options for an event that will be accessible to “all people in Aberdeen”.He said: “There’s a real danger with a dinner that it becomes exclusive and not inclusive.“We may end up with the same ‘well kent faces’ and I don’t think that would be the best thing in this situation.”Liberal Democrat group colleagues also expressed concern over the plans.Group leader of the party Ian Yuill said: “I agree it’s very important that we do celebrate the anniversary. Our concern is that a dinner, while nice for those that attend, is very transitory and would have no lasting benefit to the city and its citizens.”The most lasting legacy of the charter is the city’s Common Good Fund, which is used for a number of charitable causes every year.Robert the Bruce gave Aberdeen the Forest of Stocket, now the Midstocket area of the city, in return for a yearly rent.As a result of the finances generated from the forest, the Common Good Fund was created to benefit the people of the city. The fund helped to create Marischal College and assisted citizens during the 1640 plague.Other recognised Aberdeen institutions also benefited from the funds, and cash was given to Aberdeen Art Gallery, the Central Library, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the purchase of Hazlehead Park.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said he was “confident” the event would include members of the community who “do so much to make the city what it is”.He added: “For me this is just part of what next year will be as a celebration year and there might be other events we could do to mark the occasion.”Members voted 22 votes to 22 with Mr Crockett having the casting vote in favour of holding the dinner.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated12:58, 11 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal. A museum in the Town Hall and a drive to convert empty shop units for housing have also been put forward. It is all part of South Ayrshire Council’s answer to save the ailing High Street and politicians are launching a consultation to get feedback. Revealing the masterplan, council leader Douglas Campbell said: “The Citadel is coming to the end of its useful life. We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” It would be sited at the Arran Mall if the plans get the go-ahead. Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

of voyages across the Atlantic to New York as well as the Mediterranean Sea, serving as a gunner.\nIt was dangerous occupation, with cargo such as aircraft fuel and ammunition making the DEMS a target for German U-Boats but Stephen successfully completed three years\u0026rsquo service with the branch.\nA book on his career and life was published last year by Brian Parker, of Yetholm.\nStephen was given the opportunity to raise the Merchant Navy flag at Scottish Borders Council\u0027s headquarters alongside convener David Parker.\nCouncillor Parker said: \u0026ldquoI was delighted to be able to host local ex-Merchant Navy personnel and their families and hear some fascinating stories about their time serving their country.\n\u0026ldquoMeeting the likes of Stephen Taylor Smith was an honour and I am proud the Council will fly the Merchant Navy flag above our Headquarters this week.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new-businesses-flock-to-revamped-selkirk-town-centre","story":"COMMUNITY leaders

the past year.\nAs well as improvements to the clock and Town Hall, many other historic buildings have been refurbished, the Market Place has been reconfigured and new paving and street furniture will be added over the coming weeks.\nThe revamp has already led to two new businesses taking out leases during August.\nAnd it is hoped that others will follow as community leaders hope to return to the hey-days of a bustling high street.\nAlistair Pattullo, chairman of Selkirk Community Council, told us: \"It has been a long haul with all of the works and undoubtedly our traders have suffered, but everything is starting to take shape.\n\"It\u0027s great that we have new businesses arriving in the town, the new Farmers Market is proving hugely popular and the pop-up shops are doing really well again.\n\"There are still one or two premises to fill, but we are definitely going in the right direction.\"\nMany businesses suffered during the almost year-long improvement works and one of the first to close was Halliwell\u0027s Butchers.\nBut this week the shop reopened under new management.\nJohn Taylor, who has run shops in Kelso and Edinburgh, believes the new-look town centre is the perfect location.\nThe 46-year-old from Jedburgh said: \"Selkirk Market Place is looking great.\n\"People have been coming into the shop while we\u0027ve been getting the place ready and everyone is complimentary about how Selkirk is now looking.\"\nMr Taylor, who has been a butcher since 1989, is employing two people within the new shop.\nAnd he is confident the new venture will be a great success.\nHe added: \"We have done a lot of planning over the past two or three months and we feel this is the right shop in the right town.\n\"We\u0027re just really looking forward to opening and getting to know people a lot better.\"\nAnother company ready to bring some welcome aromas to the High Street as well as taste is the Three Hills Coffee company from Maxton.\nSince 2016 they have been supplying top quality, freshly roasted beans to businesses in the Borders.\nAnd over the past month or two a relocation to a former boutique in Selkirk for their roastery and coffee shop has been underway.\nThe company is currently recruiting ahead of a planned opening over the next few weeks.\nAnd the former Royal Bank of Scotland premises, which were vacated in June, is the new home for

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building. It depresses me, but I can\u0026rsquot see any other option but to approve this as pretty much all options have been reasonably explored, so it\u0026rsquos with a heavy heart that I vote with the officer\u0026rsquos recommendation.\nGalashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison also supported the recommendation to allow the demolition but said he would be sad to see it go, adding: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a huge emotional issue in terms of buildings and things which are of historic significance.\n\u0026ldquoI worry about the future of built environments.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support

Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging

are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The action against the MP, who took the Kent city seat at the 2017 election with a majority of just 187 \u0026ndash after 99 years as a Tory stronghold \u0026ndash was later dismissed following an outcry from fellow MPs.

The ex-special adviser and lawyer admitted he was prepared to go along with the DUP\u0026rsquos official version of events.#  Renewable heat incentive  inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked him: \u0026ldquoAnd that is politics is it?  Renewable heat incentive  inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked him: \u0026ldquoAnd that is politics is it?  The witness responded: \u0026ldquoThat is politics I am afraid \u0026ndash it is a grubby world.  The retired judge said: \u0026ldquoThat is something of an understatement, if you don\u0026rsquot mind me saying.  Mr Cairns concurred: \u0026ldquoI think you are correct, Mr chairman.  He said he had not tried to smear the former enterprise minister over the closure of the scheme.  Sir Patrick said the \u0026ldquoclear inference was that the witness was prepared to modify his comments about Mr Bell to protect former DUP leader Mr Robinson.  The green energy scheme paid over-generous subsidies to wood fuel burner owners.  Concerns centre on how long it took to close after civil servants became aware of the flaws and the DUP\u0026rsquos alleged role, if any, in manipulating that closure date.  The devolved powersharing institutions collapsed early last year after Sinn Fein walked out over the DUP\u0026rsquos handling of the RHI and repeated rounds of negotiations have failed to resurrect them.  Documents before the public inquiry, including a text message from Mr Cairns to another party special adviser, showed the witness was prepared to, in his words, fit his story into the party\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquonarrative around RHI.  Sir Patrick added: \u0026ldquoThat seems a rather unpleasant way to run a party.  Mr Cairns also suggested the DUP\u0026rsquos chief executive, Timothy Johnston, delayed the closure of the RHI scheme to allow others to join.  He claimed DUP leader Arlene Foster knew about Mr Johnston\u0026rsquos role in delaying closure, which she has denied.  Mr Cairns said Mr Johnston\u0026rsquos influence was felt from the top to the bottom of the party. Mr Johnston is a former party special adviser who denied there was any hierarchy.  Earlier stages in the inquiry have heard there was a mistaken belief among those involved in designing the RHI that the Treasury would pick up the bill, so the intention was to have as many as possible enrolled to attract funds to Northern Ireland.  Mr Cairns has denied any plan to fit Mr Bell up.  Much of the former party official\u0026rsquos evidence contradicted Mr Bell\u0026rsquos version of events, discussed during the ex-Assembly member\u0026rsquos colourful evidence sessions before the inquiry last week.  In written evidence, Mr Cairns claimed his minister, who was leading an Invest Northern Ireland trade mission, sang the Deep Blue Something hit Breakfast At Tiffany\u0026rsquos at the top of his voice as he was helped back to his New York hotel after having drunk too much."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8538893.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"theresa-may-pledges-106m-funding-boost-for-green-vehicles","story":"  The Prime Minister used a speech in Birmingham on Tuesday to pledge a \u0026pound106 million funding boost for research and development in the sector which also covers new batteries and low-carbon technology.

Mr Brown said the recent meetings have \"successfully tapped into the enthusiasm for and possibilities of an independent Scotland\".\"The Edinburgh event was the biggest National Assembly we\u0027ve ever held and there was a real buzz about the venue,\" the SNP depute said.  \"Member led group debates - on the Growth Commission report\u0027s findings and a whole lot more - gave us really valuable feedback.  \"And this is just the start of the conversation. New online resources will allow SNP branches across the country the opportunity to have their say on the Growth Commission and wider discussions, both with the Yes family and civic Scotland, will take place in the coming months too.  \"While the Westminster parties are deeply divided and on the brink of implosion over Brexit, our party and the independence movement are in great health and positive about Scotland\u0027s future as an independent country.  \"A recent poll showed a majority would vote for Scottish independence after the UK leaves the European Union. The latest Social Attitudes Survey showing that the number of people view independence as a positive for Scotland\u0027s economy now outnumber those who believe otherwise.  \"These indications are greatly encouraging as we continue to build the fresh case for an independent Scotland.\"  Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \"The SNP party faithful can get together for coffee and a blether as often as they wish but it doesn\u0027t alter the fact that the people of Scotland voted decisively to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.  \"Keith Brown\u0027s comments only illustrate the one deep and substantive division - between the SNP and the democratic will of Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"best-fish-and-chip-shop-in-scotland-revealed","story":"  It comes as the finalists of the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year award are unveiled as part of the 2019 National Fish \u0026amp Chip Awards.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8544879.jpg?type=article-full","title":"book-your-christmas-party-venue-at-one-of-these-five-festive-spots","story":"  If\u0026nbspyou\u0027re looking for an exciting location for\u0026nbspyour work party\u0026nbspor somewhere to enjoy Christmas lunch, consider these fantastic five restuarants...  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Drimsynie Estate  If you\u0026rsquore looking for somewhere a little different to impress your clients, or maybe just take your work Christmas party up a notch, Drimsynie Estate could be the choice for you.

The V\u0026ampA Dundee, as well as being a show-stopping piece of architecture courtesy of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is also a keynote building in the future of the city in which it is based, part of Dundee\u0026rsquos long-term plans for the waterfront .  As a result, it\u0026rsquos difficult to imagine a building in Scotland that will open with more hype, hope and razzmatazz.  \u0026ldquoThe opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee is a big moment, agrees Long. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a big moment for the institution, but it\u0026rsquos a big moment in the life of Dundee. And I get a sense that there\u0026rsquos excitement about the project much further afield than that. So, we want to make sure that it\u0026rsquos celebrated in a pretty spectacular way.  Over and above the celebrations that will accompany the opening , the museum is also tasked with creating an economic uplift for the city, in effect Dundee\u0026rsquos very own \u0026ldquoBilbao effect. No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate. Shortly afterwards it was successful in being awarded the title of Unesco City of Creative Design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0026rsquove seen here in the city is one success leads to a greater ambition. There\u0026rsquos that sense in the city of: \u0026lsquoWe get things done here.\u0026rsquo I think that is really building confidence here.

Now he has decided to show it instead.  So he ushers us in the shade behind his white van and brandishes a photo of the empty car deck of an ageing ro-ro. \"They had told us the boat was fully booked,\" he says. \"But it was empty. Computer problems.\"  Mr Higgins is having a picnic lunch on the front at Brodick, Arran\u0027s main port, as another load of tourists in sunglasses, their faces glowing red from sun and sea, trundle hand luggage along its promenade. \"I like to get off the island when the visitors come,\" he smiles, watching them. \"That is not always easy. In the summer you have to book three weeks in advance.\"  It is a brilliant September day, the Firth of Clyde is a flat azure that melts seamlessly in to the sky and Arran is heaving. It has been all season. So are the boats that provide its lifeline links to the mainland. The island is home to just over 5,000 people. Last year 911,434 passengers were clocked on its two ferry routes. That is 20 per cent more than a decade ago. The figures for cars are rising even faster, by 44 per cent from 2007 to total 229,664 in 2017.  This summer traffic \u0026ndash most of it on what is often a two-boat service out of Ardrossan on the North Ayrshire coast \u0026ndash has grown again.  The passengers Mr Higgins watched had passed through a high-tech adjustable gangway and state-of-the-art terminal . But they did so after coming off a boat built in 1984, the MV Isle of Arran. And that is a problem.  The vessel, its interior a beige time capsule of sticky seats and retro puggies, has had problems, more specifically this year, propeller pitch control problems. Cue service disruption, and not for the first time.  The old boat was supposed to have been replaced this summer by a new high-tech environmentally friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox. That ship is delayed. Hence the frustration of Mr Higgins and much the rest of Arran.  Yet this local row \u0026ndash albeit affecting Scotland\u0027s busiest ferry route \u0026ndash is just one symptom of a much bigger problem, a problem that has been a generation in the making.  Simply put, Scotland\u0027s islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old, really old.  There is a mantra in the ferry industry about this crisis. Nobody, insiders insist, is to blame. And nobody, they add, will be able to find a quick fix.  That is because half of the ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes have seen out their ideal lifespan of 25 years.  The average age of a ship is 22. In the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building , the average age was 12. The number, unchecked, has been rising ever since. In fact, it has been a generation since Scotland, one of Europe\u0027s most \"islandy\" nations, was launching enough ferries to sustain its fleet.  The result? Boats break down. And when they break down they are hard to fix. And our islands suffer.  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. One, the Hebridean Isles, built 1985, which usually services Islay, has been laid up twice, thanks to damage in rough seas off Tiree and a collision with the harbour at Kennacraig on Kintyre.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, are among those out of action.  Bad things happen at sea that is to be expected. What counts is whether the entire system \u0026ndash fleet-wide \u0026ndash can cope when they do.  Take Calmac. The biggest operator of ferries runs most services to islands and peninsulas in Western Scotland. It is state-owned. Its ferries are owned by another state owned entity, CMAL, which also owns or leases the boats that, under a separate Northlink franchise, service routes to the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  Between January and the end of July this year, some 2,326 out of 79,203 Calmac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because Calmac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  However, a ferry that does not sail is not quite like a bus that does not turn up on time. There are rarely alternatives. And with ferries packed to capacity, alternative travel is not always easily arrangeable.  When a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. Calmac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled, bobbing about at sea waiting to save the day. Indeed, even if it did have a spare, Calmac could far from guarantee it could use it. Why? Every port has its own pecularities, whether it is an ageing linkspan or unusual tide. This is not a standardised fleet. Most ships and ports are bespoke.  Usually Calmac gets the blame. It is the firm with the name on the side of its ships, with their trademark blue hulls and white superstructures. In fact, the firm, which had to compete to secure its franchise from its own government owners, has been warning about a growing problem with its service for years.  Back in 2010 the company bluntly told the Scottish Government that a new ferry would have to be launched every year just to stand still.  In its submission to that year\u0027s ferry review, it said such a drumbeat of production could cut the average age of the fleet from 22 in 2012 to 19.5 in 2022.  Warnings have echoed ever since. In March, Calmac\u0027s chief executive, Robbie Drummond, signalled this summer could be tough. He said: \"Any issues with a vessel on one part of the network will have knock-on effects for other routes, as boats need to be diverted or deployed elsewhere to keep the lifeline network running.  \"Islay has already been adversely affected by such changes this week, with one of the two ferries that normally serve the island needing to be withdrawn to fulfil contractual obligations elsewhere.  \"The working life expectancy of a ferry deployed on routes like those on Scotland\u0027s western seaboard is around 25 years, so with nearly half of the ferries working these routes already beyond that milestone - and having been used intensively during those years of service - the risk of mechanical failures and breakdown is significant.  \"It also takes longer to get older boats back into service when things do go wrong, often due to the difficulty in sourcing parts across Europe.\"  By May there were more grumbles. Mr Drummond, summoned to Holyrood, spelled out the problems again. He told MSPs: \"It remains the case that we have no spare vessels to accommodate this eventuality.  \"It was not a minor breakdown a major vessel has been out for more than two months, and is coming back in for another two weeks while we get back on track.  \"There has been a period of major disruption\u0026mdashthe worst the company has experienced for eight years. We have tried as best we can to provide the best possible service through that period.\"  Key stakeholders are not happy. Outer Hebrides Tourism  reckons it lost \u0026pound6m from service cancellations after the breakdown of one boat. Ian Fordham, its chairman, this week said: \"While the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco. This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  It is not as if the Scottish Government is not investing. The current SNP administration has put a cool billion pounds in to ferry services since it came to power in 2007. This includes \u0026pound97m for two new ferries being built for CMAL at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow. The first of these, the MV Glen Sannox, was supposed to go in to service this summer to replace the Isle of Arran but will not start operating until, at current estimates, next summer. A second, now codenamed 802, will run to the Western Isles to help address the OHT\u0027s concerns. It isn\u0027t convinced. Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  \"How they will manage this against the backdrop of traffic and visitor growth to the Outer Hebrides?\" it said.  The boom in visitors was not expected. Some put that down to the Scottish Government\u0027s flagship \"road equivalent tariff\" or RET scheme under which a ferry journey should not cost more than a drive. But other factors are at play: the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote means more tourists from both home and abroad.  Across the Calmac network, the last five years have been busy. Between 2012 and 2017 the number of cars carried grow by 37 per cent to 1.43m per year. Passenger numbers rose 17 per cent to 5.2 million per year.  Joe Cullinane is pleased with that. He leads North Ayrshire Council, which includes key Clyde ferries, including Arran\u0027s. \"The fleet is too old to meet the demands of RET,\" he says. \"RET is great for the added tourism. But the infrastructure is not ready to cope with RET, our roads, our ports and our ferries.\"  The RET pressure has been hardest on Mr Cullinane\u0027s patch. Tiny Cumbrae, gets more visitors than all of the Western Isles put together. So many, in fact, that there is now routine traffic congestion in the sedate resort town of Largs from where a new hybrid ferry sails. Why? Cars queuing for the hop across the First of Clyde.  The new ferries on order at Ferguson Marine are also hybrids. This vexes some of Scotland\u0027s \"armchair admirals\", the voices berating the decision to invest in new tech, rather than tried and tested conventional ships. The delays to the two new ships have been at least partly put down to the risk of innovation. Some critics have also suggested a quick order could be placed for a cheep-and-cheerful diesel-guzzling chugger in a low-cost shipyard in the Far East. Policy-makers reckon that would just be another stop-gap solution.  The Scottish Goverment quango Transport Scotland asked Calmac and CMAL to look for off-the-shelf boats to buy or lease to fill the gaps. It even suggested that it would pay for them. So couldn\u0027t Scotland just pick up a \"rustbucket\" from the Greek Islands or Norway? No. There are just no vessels out there that would work.  Transport Scotland said it \"continued to invest\" in new ships and ports. Its experts stress that ferries should not be seen as ships in isolation. They are part of a complex system that includes ports and other transport connections. They have to \"fit\".  CMAL had no comment. It has its two new delayed ships on order and then will look to get another, for Islay. The future of Scottish ferries - of Scotland\u0027s islands - now lies in the hands of a document CMAL published in January. The Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan or VRDP is a detailed run-down of what boat should go where for years to come. It\u0027s very last words should be music to the ears of Scottish islanders and visitors. It says: \u0026ldquoConsider the opportunity to develop a medium/large class of major vessel capable of working effectively and efficiently on a number of routes across the network.  What this means is a move to more standardised vessels for big routes, namely from Oban to Colonsay, Islay, Coll and Tiree from Mallaig to Lochboisdale in the Western Isles and Armadale on Skye and from Wemyss Bay on the Clyde to Rothesay on Bute. For standardised ships, these ports will have to have standardised or future-proof harbour facilities built. That is big money. But, crucially, it would mean Calmac could reshuffle its fleet far more easily when something goes wrong.  The VRDP did not say when such plans would be considered. Transport Scotland was able to. It\u0027s next year. A spokesman said: \"The focus of the next vessel procurement will be a new ferry for Islay to replace the MV Hebridean Isles. This will maintain our investment programme, currently focused on the construction of two major vessels for the CMAL fleet and a number of major harbour projects.  \"The development of a medium/large class of major vessel will be considered by Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac as part of their programme of work. This is intended to get underway next year.\"  Back on Arran there was more trouble this weekend. The island\u0027s other main ferry, the Caledonian Isles, now exactly 25 years old, was cancelled for technical reasons. Islanders are used to this.  Sheila Gilmore, out walking her cockapoo Archie, was philosophical. Arran born and bred, she now runs the local destination marketing bureau, Visit Arran. \"It is frustrating when you can\u0027t get off the island. We have to get used to that. What we want is to make sure we have two ferries on the main Ardrossan route all year round. Across the network? Resilience is the issue. We need a spare boat.\""},{"url":null,"title":"world-trade-centre-subway-station-reopens-for-first-time-since-911","story":"  Cheers erupted as the first train rolled into the new WTC Cortlandt station.

She will tell the TUC Congress in Manchester today: \u0026ldquoIn the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day. In the 20th century, we won the right to a two-day weekend and paid holidays.  \u0026ldquoSo, for the 21st century, let\u0026rsquos lift our ambition again.  \u0026ldquoI believe that in this century we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time to share the wealth from new technology. Not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWe need strong unions with the right to go into every workplace - starting with Amazon\u0026rsquos warehouses here in the UK.  Research by the TUC showed that most workers expect only managers and shareholders to reap the benefits of new technology.  However, the survey of over 2,000 workers also found that four out of five employees want to cut their working hours without losing any pay as new technology makes work more efficient.  The TUC believes moves should be put in place to try to cut the working week to four days over the course of this century.  In her speech, Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady accused employers of making staff work unpredictable or unsocial hours because of an \u0026ldquoalways on culture.  She added that too many firms were using technology to treat workers unfairly.  The general secretary said: \u0026ldquoBosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new technology for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWorking people deserve their fair share - and that means using the gains from new technology to raise pay and allow more time with their families.  \u0026ldquoIf productivity gains from new technology are even half as good as promised then the country can afford to make working lives better.  However, while unions believe there are potential gains to be made from new technology, they also have concerns about robots and machinery replacing workers.  A report published earlier this year also warned that the UK is lagging behind other nations in terms of readiness for increased automation.  Pat Rafferty, Scottish Secretary of Unite, has previously claimed that there are positives for workers, but warned against a \u0026ldquonightmare scenario of machines replacing workers and cataclysmic numbers thrown out of work.  Unison have also argued that, while the impact of new technology is sometimes exaggerated by experts, strategies on automation need to be put in place now to ensure workers can transition into other roles.  The Scottish Government has already put a number of steps in place to address the issue, including further investment in digital skills, the creation of a Just Transition Commission, and a plan to provide direct support for additional business research and development."},{"url":null,"title":"why-time-could-be-right-for-tvs-queen-of-calm-to-take-dimblebys-job","story":"  She\u0026rsquos fond of an occasional single malt with ice to help her unwind, or a refreshing G\u0026ampT to perk her up.

The job becomes vacant in mid-December, when David Dimbleby hangs up his colourful tie collection and ends 25 years of pointing at slightly discombobulated audience members while attempting to describe their clothes or hairstyles without causing offence.\u0026nbsp  But first he will be in his usual centre stage spot, when Question Time rolls into the Scottish Parliament debating chamber next month, for a programme that will form part of the Festival of Politics.  The October 11 programme is likely to be the last chance for Scots to see a master chairman at work before a new, fresh-faced presenter takes over.\u0026nbsp  According to the bookies, that will probably be Wark, frontrunner among a Who\u0026rsquos Who of broadcasters linked to a role said to earn Dimbleby around \u0026pound450,000 a year.\u0026nbsp  Challenging the 62-year-old Scot is fellow Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, BBC News Channel Newswatch host Samira Ahmed, daytime presenter Victoria Derbyshire, Channel 4 anchorman Krishnan Guru-Murthy and ex-Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman.\u0026nbsp  Read more:\u0026nbspKirsty Wark and BBC colleagues call for \"urgent solutions\" over gender pay gap  So, what are Glasgow-based Wark\u0026rsquos chances?

Despite criticism of \u0026ldquodumbing down with guests that include actors and comedians, Question Time remains the UK\u0026rsquos foremost political programme, with about 2.7million viewers.\u0026nbsp  It hit a peak of 8.3m when Nick Griffin of the BNP appeared on the panel in 2009 \u0026ndash a point that ushered in a new, highly controversial style of panel member, and saw Nigel Farage and opinionated historian David Starkey favoured over what some might regard as far more relevant political voices.  That, says former Scottish first minister Jack McConnell,\u0026nbsp  now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, has contributed to the programme losing its way.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos deliberately moved away from a programme that expands the knowledge of the viewer, to one that has attempted to be an entertainment show in which people shout at each other.  In an age when too many media interviews are carefully controlled to produce a line for news, Question Time could play an important role. Instead, it produces zero public benefit in that context.  While reluctant to discuss his friend\u0026rsquos potential role on the programme, his vision of the next presenter is not a million miles away from Wark.  He says: \u0026ldquoThe role needs someone who has authority, who is well-researched and doesn\u0026rsquot rely on research done by a team behind the scenes.

No one realised then, however, that the impact on its neighbours would also be utterly devastating.  You can\u0026rsquot understate the CCA\u0026rsquos contribution to Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural scene and reputation. But neither can you play down how fundamental GSA \u0026ndash which sits just feet away - has been to this ongoing success. The two organisations share not only an outlook, networks and ideas, but personnel. A significant number of the CCA staff and many who exhibit there are students or former students of the art school. The centre\u0026rsquos visionary director, Francis McKee, is a lecturer and researcher at GSA.  It would therefore be the most terrible irony if the CCA was forced out of business due to its close proximity to its creative twin. But this is now a real possibility.  Over the last few days we learned that the centre, which unlike other Garnethill residents and businesses was not allowed back in earlier this month, is on a financial knife-edge, facing indefinite limbo and possible ruin as no date has been given for when the west fa\u0026ccedilade of the Mackintosh building on Scott Street will be made safe.  The frustrating reality is that the CCA - which actually comprises 18\u0026nbspbusinesses and institutions under one banner and roof \u0026ndash currently has no control over its fate, and must watch helplessly as Glasgow City Council and GSA lay responsibility at each other\u0026rsquos door each other for the situation. The fact is, though, while the safety of the west fa\u0026ccedilade of the Mack remains a concern, re-opening presents a challenge for the CCA, especially since the Scott Street door is a fire exit.  Obviously, the council has a legal obligation to keep people safe. But it\u0026rsquos vital now that all parties \u0026ndash including Creative Scotland, which owns the CCA building \u0026ndash come together so that energy can be put into finding creative solutions worthy of this cultural icon that would allow it to re-open, even partially, and begin to rebuild. Apportioning blame wastes time and diverts attention what we need now is focus and action to avert disaster.  I spoke to Mr McKee over the weekend and he put forward three practical solutions that could bring things back from the brink in the short term. The first is access for a plumber and builder to assess and fix a leak that has resulted in a ceiling collapse in the exhibition space. Considering the position of these facilities in the building, accompanied safe access would surely be possible?  The second is a re-assessment of fire exits to allow partial access for businesses and customers. After all, the CCA\u0026rsquos Sauchiehall Street neighbours on either side are already back in business. Mr McKee also suggests a safety canopy over the Scott Street exit for the duration of remaining works to mitigate safety concerns.  The third part of the jigsaw is a date for the opening of the caf\u0026eacute bar \u0026ndash even if it is some way in the future \u0026ndash so insurers can continue to support this busy, buzzy meeting point which supports 32 jobs.  The Scottish Government fund set up in the aftermath of the fire is very welcome and will no doubt help with cash flow to some extent. But in this case money is only part of the problem, as Mr McKee\u0026rsquos sensible suggestions highlight. What appears to be lacking is willingness on the part of its partners and masters to really, truly stand up for this jewel in the city\u0026rsquos cultural crown in its hour of need.  Notwithstanding who or what was to blame for the fire at the Mack, GSA must surely feel some sense of responsibility for the situation and do more to assist, not least by providing some idea of a date for completion of work on the west fa\u0026ccedilade by its contractors. It could also perhaps leverage support from the international arts community for its close friend.  The council, for its part, must find ways around the sort of \u0026ldquocomputer says no attitudes and policies that led to so much criticism over the last weeks and could yet contribute to a slow and painful death for the CCA. Solutions can be found where there is a will to make them happen.  Only last week council leader Susan Aitken talked of culture and the arts playing \u0026ldquoa significant role in Sauchiehall Street\u0026rsquos rebirth. The way to make this happen is to ensure the street\u0026rsquos most valuable resident, the one that cities around the world envy and try to replicate, stays open. But time is running out."},{"url":null,"title":"new-scots-benefits-agency-has-presence-in-just-two-councils","story":"  The SNP government signed a deal with the council group Cosla last December to co-locate face-to-face customer services for Social Security Scotland in council buildings.

Ms Cartmail questioned why a company losing millions of pounds was shown to be making a profit on paper.  \"I am advised not to say this was cooking the books, so I won\u0027t,\" she added.  Dave Prentis, the General Secretary of Unison, attacked the privatisation of public services, saying: \"While Grenfell will forever be associated with neglect, Carillion will forever be associated with greed.\"  The conference called for an independent inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, and into privatisation of public services.  Mr Prentis told the conference: \"Privatisation is all about taking from the needy and giving to the greedy. It\u0027s the pinnacle of vulture capitalism that leaves chaos, waste and human tragedy in its wake.  \"Thirty miles from here lies an unfinished hospital, the Royal Liverpool.

The petition was granted and the magistrates secured the use of a warehouse in Wijnstraat, while the Presbytery of Edinburgh appointed the Rev Alexander Petrie, from Perthshire, as the kirk\u0026rsquos first minister.  As the church grew, it established a school and a poor house in the city and in 1694, its congregation was recorded as more than 1000.  A year later, in 1695, foundation stones were brought over from Scotland and the first church building was erected in the heart of the city.  This church remained in use until the Second World War, which proved to be a difficult time for the congregation due to the 1940 Rotterdam blitz.  \u0026ldquoThere was virtually no contact with Scotland during the Second World War, Mr Lawson explained.  \u0026ldquoAfter a bomb destroyed the building in 1940 there was a real risk that it would not continue.  However, through the efforts of the congregation, and with financial support from Rotterdam merchants, by 1952 the then Moderator Rt Rev Johnstone Jeffrey visited the church to dedicate a new building, which is still used today.  From there it has gone from strength to strength and now boasts a diverse and growing congregation, with continued links to the Church of Scotland, as well as the Dutch Reformed Church.  In 1996, it changed its name to the The Scots International Church Rotterdam in order to reflect the changes it has gone through.  Rev John Russell, who is the Presbytery Clerk of Dunkeld and Meigle in Perthshire, was minister of the Scots International Kirk from 1963 until 1972 and will also attend the anniversary service.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe loved our time here.  \u0026ldquoThe Manse was our first home - we arrived on a cold winter\u0026rsquos night to a warm welcome 13 days after marriage.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was appointed in 1963 I was given the task to reach out to the large English-speaking population drawn from Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States and many other nationalities living throughout South Holland.  \u0026ldquoIn my ministry this outreach was carried out and the congregation became truly multinational, a tradition that has continued throughout successive ministries.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very pleased to be going back \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos very kind of the church to invite us.  \u0026ldquoOne of our sons who was born in the manse, is coming back too.  Right Rev Susan Brown said: \u0026ldquoHaving family links with the Netherlands, it is wonderful to be able to celebrate with the congregation of the Scots International Church Rotterdam on this special anniversary.  \u0026ldquoIt is a congregation which, over the years, has continually reviewed and renewed its role and vision and as such offers vibrant testimony to the faith that undergirds all it does.  \u0026ldquoMay they continue to be a blessing to all who walk in through their doors \u0026ndash people of all nationalities!  The anniversary service, which takes place at 10.30am on Sunday, will feature performances from music groups within the congregation, as well as a short pageant presented by the children of the church congregation.  Church members will then host an international lunch, featuring food from 30 different countries.  A short service of praise will then be held, led by Rev Lawson, involving the church\u0026rsquos youth group and young adult members.  A total of 16 churches of Scotland are based overseas spread across thirteen countries."},{"url":null,"title":"dementia-cure-not-an-unrealistic-goal-top-researcher-says","story":"  Professor Bart De Strooper, a world-renowned Belgian neuroscientist, became director of the \u0026pound250 million Dementia Research Institute  in 2016, and said there could be a \"standard toolbox\" for treating patients within a decade.  This could include genetic therapies or drugs known as anti-amyloids which fight against the presence of a protein called amyloid beta, which accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u0027s.  The Alzheimer\u0027s Society said there are an estimated 850,000 people with the disease in the UK, with this number set to surpass a million by 2025.  Prof De Strooper told the : \"I think we will have a cure. In 10 years we will have a cure. I hope earlier.  \"You start to see biochemical changes about 20 years before dementia manifests itself so if you could stabilise the disease in this insidious phase then that would be very good, that would also be a cure.  \"It\u0027s a bit like with cancer, you don\u0027t hope to treat the patient when the cancer has taken over the body, you want to treat it in the beginning when you have limited trouble.\"  Nearly 300 researchers are working across six universities as part of the DRI to find an effective way of treating the causes of dementia rather than masking symptoms.  Adrian Ivinson, DRI chief operating officer, told the paper that researchers were hopeful about creating a blood test for dementia which could be used as part of a national screening programme.  He said: \"We don\u0027t have a blood test yet but that is what we are hoping for and where we are heading.  \"Some of the big programmes within the institute are focused on that.  \"It might be a few years but it\u0027s a realistic prospect.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-tells-may-to-drop-pretence-over-no-deal","story":"  SNP ministers said it was an \u0026ldquoutterly false choice designed to frighten people.  Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell will today update MSPs on preparations for Brexit, as Holyrood steps up its work.  Besides his chamber speech, Mr Russell will also appear at the delegated powers committee to discuss the Brexit-related Trade Bill.  The SNP government has said it withhold legislative consent for the UK Bill unless Scotland is allowed to sign off future trade deals in devolved areas.  The dispute is developing into another constitutional stand-off, and may result in Westminster over-ruling Holyrood as it did with the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf and the Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC will also appear at the Justice Committee today to discuss the impact of Brexit on policing and prosecution.  Mr Russell said the Conservatives were trying to force people into a false choice between a disastrous hard Brexit outside the single market and the \u0026ldquocatastrophe of No Deal.  \u0026ldquoThat is an utterly false choice \u0026ndash and no one should be fooled into thinking that that makes Chequers in any way acceptable, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that the Tories are now warning people about stockpiling of medical supplies, and potential disruption to food imports and exports shows just how serious the situation has become \u0026ndash their irresponsible approach risks disruption on a scale unprecedented in modern times.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories should stop putting their party ahead of the country, end their civil war and rule out a No-deal outcome immediately.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government are behaving as if no deal is inevitable \u0026ndash it is emphatically not.

Continued membership of the European Single Market and Customs Union is essential for our economy, society and people.  Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said: \u0026ldquoMike Russell\u0026rsquos words are aimed at stoking division in the hope it pushes up support for Scottish independence. It\u0026rsquos a shameless tactic which the SNP has already paid the price for in elections.  \u0026ldquoScots are fed up with this game-playing, and would rather the SNP government got on and tried to make a success of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"michel-barnier-raises-hopes-saying-brexit-deal-by-november-is-realistic","story":"  The optimistic words from the European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator sent sterling rising on the money markets and gave a political boost to a beleaguered Theresa May, who is facing what Steve Baker, the former Brexit Minister, called a \u0026ldquocatastrophic split within Conservative ranks if she continued to pursue her Chequers Plan.  Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos unexpectedly upbeat tone came at a conference in Slovenia, where he said: \u0026ldquoIf we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of this negotiation - which is the Brexit treaty - within six or eight weeks.  \"The treaty is clear: we have two years to reach an agreement before they leave... in March 2019.  \"That means, taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process - the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and Council on the other side - we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November it\u0026rsquos possible.  While the next European Council is due on October 18/19, it is now looking increasingly likely there will be a special Brexit summit in early November.  The chief negotiator also stressed how both sides were \u0026ldquonot far from agreement with some 80 to 85 per cent of issues already resolved.  Yet he did qualify his comments by noting how the thus far intractable issue of keeping a frictionless border on the island of Ireland still needed to be sorted out.  \u0026ldquoWe have to solve this issue of Ireland and some others in the next six to eight weeks, added Mr Barnier.  In response to his comments, Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman noted how there had been \u0026ldquopositive engagement with EU leaders over the Chequers Plan and that talks were at a \u0026ldquovery important and intense stage  \"We have said ourselves that we are focused on securing a deal in October and that continues to be what we are working towards.\"  Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond made clear, before a meeting with fellow European ministers in Vienna, the UK Government was putting pressure on EU leaders to allow Mr Barnier more flexibility in the negotiations.  It is suggested the informal summit in Salzburg on September 20, which Mrs May is due to attend, will discuss issuing additional guidance to Mr Barnier about relaxing his negotiating brief. One EU official described it as Operation \u0026ldquoSave Theresa.

Mr Baker has claimed there are as many as 80 Tories opposed to the Chequers Plan. The Conservative conference faces the prospect of being used to showcase Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos leadership challenge he is due to address a \u0026ldquoChuck Chequers rally, expected to be attended by 1,000 people.  In response, the PM is said to have ordered Gavin Barwell, her chief of staff to hard-sell the Chequers Plan to backbench MPs at a series of private dinners this week.  David Mundell, who is \u0026ldquofour square behind Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint, was asked if it would survive. The Scottish Secretary declared: \u0026ldquoOf course, it will.  On Thursday, he will join other senior colleagues for a special no-deal Cabinet to thrash out, over three hours, the details of what happens should there be no withdrawal agreement with Brussels.  Later on the same day, it is expected that the next tranche of technical notices, setting out the advice on what to do in the event of a no-deal, covering at least 20 more policy areas, will be published.  Speaking ahead of a Holyrood statement on preparations for Brexit, Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Affairs Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories want to force people to choose between the disaster of a hard Brexit outside the single market and the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThat is an utterly false choice and no one should be fooled into thinking that that makes Chequers in any way acceptable.

You can see eagles soar, watch as waders plunge their necks into the waters. Go further along, and you can see children, wide eyed with wonder, scramble about the RSPB reserve nearby, climbing the local hills.  But their hopes for a quiet retirement have been left shattered on learning that they also now live next door to a site earmarked for industrial development. They fear their quiet rural home straddling Fife and Perthshire is about to be ruined by lorries passing 500 times a day.  Their home backs onto a site where developers are controversially planning to build a waste incinerator.  The moved into the cottage just before developers logged the controversial plans.  Now Kenneth is worried about the effect of noise and pollution on the area, as well as the wider environmental impact on the neighbouring nature reserve.  Kenneth said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore worried about the noise and disruption, pollution and the health impact, both on people and animals.  \u0026ldquoWe are constantly trying to rid out towns and cities of vehicles, but what\u0027s the point if they are just driven out into the countryside. It seems hypocritical.\"  The masterplan to transform the 423-hectare Westfield opencast mine, which has lain dormant since 1998, originally centered on a huge solar farm with scattered light industrial units.  However site owner Hargreaves Services have been accused of going back on its word to build a green energy park after it emerged plans had changed to include the waste-burning facility and also a gas-fuelled power plant.  Main access for the proposed plant would be along the B9097, which runs past the RSP Loch Leven site and directly alongside the accompanying heritage trail.  Kenneth says he and his neighbours, which include an elderly woman who has lived in the area for 16 years, have been kept in the dark about the precise impact of the development \u0026ndash which they believe could see a lorry pass their homes every two or three minutes.  Green activist and former BBC Scotland environmental correspondent Louise Batchelor, who lives in Scotlandwell, near the proposed site, believes the incinerator is unnecessary.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhat was presented in the original application as a green energy proposal with lots of jobs is turning out to be a conventional incinerator with all its polluting implications.\"  Louise added: \"There\u0026rsquos evidence to suggest that where incinerators have been built, recycling decreases.  \"There is huge anxiety on the Perth \u0026amp Kinross side of the border about the amount of extra traffic, including 500 HGVs a day, which will be using the B9097, the sole access to the site.\"  The RSPB also fear the impact of the increased HGV traffic on visitors to the heritage trail.  A spokesperson for the wildlife charity said: \u0026ldquoAlong with other neighbouring businesses and families, we continue to have significant concerns regarding the safety risks to visitors to RSPB Scotland Loch Leven and the Loch Leven Heritage Trail arising from the predicted enormous increase in HGV movements on the B9097 that will be generated by the proposed development at Westfield.  Fife Council approved a provisional outline of the plant in autumn last year.  If the detailed planning application is greenlit, construction could begin as early as January 2019.  Now the Scottish Greens are also spearheading a campaign to halt plans for the incinerator.  Local MSP Mark Ruskell accused developers of \"greenwashing\" plans for the site.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe former mining communities around Westfield vividly remember the dirty days of coal, and have been living with the environmental and health consequences ever since.  \"They deserve a regeneration plan that puts green energy and sustainable development at its heart \u0026ndash not burning the nation\u0026rsquos rubbish on their doorstep.  However Hargreaves insist the site needs a backup energy source if it is to attract other businesses to the site.  Iain Cockburn, CFO of Brockwell Energy, the subsidiary of Hargreaves specialising in the development of the site, said: \"Our October 2016 planning submission included a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment in terms of traffic, landscape, ecological impact [and] all other potential impacts that might arise from development and restoration activities \u0026hellip  \"Brockwell and Hargreaves strongly believe that Westfield must have a green renewable energy focus but needs a balanced range of energy generation types if other businesses are going to be attracted to it and the green on-site energy generation used by businesses on the site.

At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:08 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks. He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartTuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:08 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:08 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:09 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He been a stalwart for Dingwall, helping to raise thousands of pounds in his role as chairman of the Fire Brigade Community Group, of which he has been on the committee for 54 years.He is also vice-chairman of the Seaforth Highlanders Regimental Association . He lives at Millcraig Road with wife Jennifer, and has been retired for nine years.The couple have a daughter, Lorna, who lives in Glasgow and three granddaughters, Morgan , Kayla  and Nyah .The eldest followed in her grandfather\u0026rsquos musical footsteps and gave him one of his proudest moments when she performed a senior drumming role in the Army Cadets Pipe Band parade last Easter. Mr Angus is a noted drummer and was back behind the drum kit on Saturday just prior to his accolade, entertaining the crowd.The former Dingwall Academy pupil threw himself into his drumming career ahead of a 26-year stint with North of Scotland Water Authority, which became Scottish Water. He said he enjoys helping his home town.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:09 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartTuesday 11 Sep 2018 3:09 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

The Partnership provides an invaluable forum where the partners can co-operate and get this assurance.\nReducing energy costs is just one way to tackle fuel poverty. The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help. We already have a number of Living Wage employers in Shetland from public agencies to small businesses.\nNobody has said that the named organisations are expected to create 800 jobs.

This might yet be of some use to Shetland further down the road, or more likely any revenues generated will also be locked up for the benefit of friends and hanger-ons.\nIt reminds me of what Benny Wiseman once told me about that word might. “It’s a brally sma’ thing on the hide o’ an elephant’s arse.”\nPeter, reading from afar, it seems that Shetland’s public funds are spread across a large number of organisations.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThe correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.\nBy her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.\nClearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.\nIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls?\nAnd while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.\nThe aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.\nHer government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drift with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.\nThis reliance on the DUP remains the central problem and if any process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.\nThe Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere else on this is-land.\nLeo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.\nThere can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.\nThese are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.\nWhat is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"dont deport us back to iraq","story":"\nTWO junior Iraqi doctors who fled their war-torn nation due to death threats made to one of their lives, say they hope the Home Office will reconsider its decision to imminently deport them due to complications with their visa.\n\nSpeaking from their home off Lisburn Road’s Chadwick Street, Yosra Taleb Abdalla who shares the property with her husband Usamah Ather Ali and two young children – one of whom is aged just 20 months –  explained how she and Ali had been working as junior doctors when Ali, who worked for the Ministry for Defence in Baghdad, received a threat to his life. \n\n“We applied for a visa to Dublin and then went onto Belfast,” said Yosra. “We have been here nearly three years, from the beginning of January 2016.”\n\nYosra continued: “The people here have been extremely kind to us and the children enjoy the multicultural side of life.\n\n“We feel safe here, we are safe here we feel that no-one can hurt us here.”\n\nYosra explained how the Home Office decision, which was made in late July, refused the family’s submission for asylum and to date the family have received no further correspondence as to when they have to leave the country.\n\nAs both Yosra and Ali have not successfully secured asylum neither can work, leaving the family in limbo.\n\n“We fear we will forget all we have learned in our profession,” said Yosra. “It is our hope to work.\n\n“We were doctors in our home country, we were living a normal life, and now we are here trying to live our lives. We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountiful fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit no 10 rubbishes flying squad of border inspectors plan for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

a powerful group of Tories advocating for a hard Brexit.\n\nThe proposal drawn up by Hans Maessen - described as a Dutch Customs Expert - says customs officials would be able to check goods while they are still “on the premises of the “importer/forwarder” rather than at the border.\n\nCross-border trading companies, under the plan, could self-declare the tax they owe on goods, as well as certify the standards and quality.\n\nThe Sun reports “mobile inspections teams” alongside “incidental inspections at the border” would make sure rules were being followed.\n\nThe border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has become one of the major sticking points in the EU exit talks with both sides in disagreement on how best to ensure a frictionless crossing in the future between the UK and its only land border with the EU on the island of Ireland.\n\nIt\u0027s thought the ERG is to publish its plan -

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup run in an unpleasant way rhi inquiry chair claims","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37305071.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/SOCCER%20Mo%2035.jpg","title":"gambling addict kyle lafferty never happier after going a year without placing a bet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He said after the fine he feared he would not get a place in Northern Ireland\u0027s Euro 2016. He went on to start two of the games. \n\nHe has said he has \u0027lost big\u0027 in the past but that it wasn\u0027t enough to worry him because he knew a big signing-on fee or bonus would cover any losses.\n\nThe 30-year-old said his issues with gambling began after he made his 2008 switch from Burnley to Rangers. \n\nSpeaking in September 2017, he said: \"About halfway through my contract with Rangers I didn\u0027t have anything better to do after training than go to the bookies or sit online. Betting on football had been banned and, if anything, things got worse. I\u0027d bet on horses instead.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures rory mcilroys swanky florida pad on the market","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"stormont politics a grubby world former adviser tells rhi inquiry","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mr Johnston is a former party special adviser who denied there was any hierarchy.\n\nEarlier stages in the inquiry have heard there was a mistaken belief among those involved in designing the RHI that the Treasury would pick up the bill, so the intention was to have as many as possible enrolled to attract funds to Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Cairns has denied any plan to fit Mr Bell up.\n\nMuch of the former party official’s evidence contradicted Mr Bell’s version of events, discussed during the ex-Assembly member’s colourful evidence sessions before the inquiry last week.\n\nIn written evidence, Mr Cairns claimed his minister, who was leading an Invest Northern Ireland trade mission, sang the Deep Blue Something hit Breakfast At Tiffany’s at the top of his voice as he was helped back to his New York hotel after having drunk too much.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"things karen bradley never knew viral trend after secretary of state admits lack of northern ireland knowledge","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
