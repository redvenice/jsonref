Beynon shares his bed with these three women every night but on the weekends up to 30 women - who message him on Instagram - are also invited to join the party. Talking about their sex lives, Taesha says: \u0027What we do in here is more extreme than porn\u0027          Flamboyant: Beynon - who calls himself The Candyman and his house The Candy Shop Mansion - poses on the edge of his swimming pool which has a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. He says: \u0027My idol Gianni Versace was obsessed with the beauty of women. For me it\u0027s women, art, cars and fashion. I\u0027m a visionary and I\u0027m f***ing crazy - there\u0027s so much going on and it\u0027s how I express who I am\u0027          Lavish: His courtyard contains a classical-inspired water feature, two palm trees and a huge mosaic of Bacchus, god of wine. The tycoon invites 1,000 people into his home each year for a huge party. \u0027I\u0027m trying to give people that escape – to come into a world they would never experience and live like it for a day,\u0027 he says          The Angels: Beynon calls his wife and girlfriends \u0027angels\u0027. He has given each of them a matching necklace - the key to the mansion - which stands them apart from other girls who sleep with him on the weekends. His wife Taesha (left) says the four-way relationship works because she likes girls. She met Nisha (centre) at a modelling shoot where they \u0027hit it off\u0027 and she later introduced her to her husband          Fashion: Next to the bedroom is a huge walk-in wardrobe where he keeps more than 100 pairs of shoes, countless shirts and jackets and a range of Gucci and Versace watches, protected by bulletproof glass. Beynon says his time as a model made him fascinated by fashion and he keeps his interest up now. He says he has never met a girl who packs more clothes than him          Outdoors: The mansion boasts a sprawling garden which overlooks the river. \u0027This is where the wild parties happen,\u0027 Beynon says pointing to the swimming pool with a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. The tycoon prides himself on attention to detail. He says he hand-draws all his designs and artworks which cover the mansion          The bedroom: Beynon shares the master bedroom with three women every night. There are two bathrooms - one for him and one for the women - and a make-up area where the women each have their own mirror and set of drawers containing all the beauty products under the sun. The ceiling above the bed is mirrored and on the wall is a staggering collage of Salvador Dali works which he put together himself. Discussing his sex life, Beynon says: \u0027I make Fifty Shades Of Grey look like a kindergarten. I\u0027m just non-stop, I’m f***ing nuts.\u0027          Extraordinary: The underside of the roof jutting out towards the pool is inspired by the Sistine Chapel itself, Beynon says, adding: \u0027I became fascinated by Renaissance art when I was modelling in Italy. These ideas all come from my head and this is how I see the world\u0027. The rest of his mansion is littered with Renaissance and classical-inspired pieces          The original: Beynon\u0027s painting is inspired by the roof of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Italy. In 1508, Pope Julius II, who was head of the Church from 1503 to 1513, hired Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the chapel which is now one of the most famous painted interior spaces in the world          The boardroom: This is where Beynon runs his business empire in the afternoons and evenings. A large table surrounded by throne-like blue and gold chairs sits opposite his desk supporting a flat screen TV, a golden calculator and golden tissue box alongside a portrait of his wife  Luxurious: Beynon designed the wooden floor himself with glass panels so he can see his cars in the garage below. \u0027This won Australian Residential Floor Of The Year,\u0027 he says proudly, pointing to the framed certificate on the wall. The room is where he organises his parties with his assistants. They comb through 7,000 applications from the general public to eventually invite 1,000 revellers to his home every December          The garage: Beynon walks through two automatic glass doors - engraved with the words work harder, play harder - to his garage containing a Ferrari F40, Lamborghini Aventador, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe, a Jeep and a gold-sprayed motorbike for weekend rides. \u0027The Rolls is my Bruce Wayne car, the Lambo my Batman,\u0027 Beynon says, explaining that he has two different personalities          Welcome to the house of fun: The words Candy Shop Mansion sit above Beynon\u0027s gold-plated wooden front doors flanked by two white statues and perfectly trimmed hedges. The tycoon made his first million as a model before riding the Gold Coast property boom of the early 2000s and using the proceeds to buy a a controlling stake in his parents\u0027 Free Choice tobacco company. He\u0027s now worth multi-millions and makes no attempt to hide it          Pass the popcorn: The home cinema, kitted out with multiple light settings, rows of red leather chairs that fully recline and a four-metre bed \u0027for when it\u0027s just me and the girls\u0027.

Talking about the couple\u0027s joint-decision to introduce other girlfriends into their relationship, his wife Taesha says: \u0027I kissed girls when I was younger and have always been curious so we were both keen to try it out and see how it went and it evolved from there\u0027The courtyard of 46-year-old Beynon\u0027s Gold Coast home, which he bought in 2010 for $3.75million, contains a classical-inspired water feature, two palm trees and a huge mosaic of Bacchus, god of wine.The words Candy Shop Mansion sit above his gold-plated wooden front doors flanked by two white statues and perfectly trimmed hedges.

You have Travers Beynon - the entrepreneur the family man. On the other side you have The Candyman - the entertainer, the playboy.\u0027As if to prove his point about his softer, family man side, he then takes a lift upstairs which he had installed for when he moves his elderly father into the mansion to take care of him.          Excessive: Beynon has more than 100 pairs of shoes in the walk-in wardrobe which he shares with his wife. He likes to pick out which outfits she wears from day to day. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia from his Candy Shop Mansion, he insisted that he is neither a sexist nor a misogynist but merely a good-time guy making fun of people who take life too seriously          Extravagant: The wardrobe also has countless jackets, belts and handbags.

He says: \u0027I sign so many cheques and contracts it\u0027s a very important tool.\u0027 He also has dozens of watches, mostly by Gucci and Versace which he keeps in a bulletproof case          Peculiar: This is a collage of Salvador Dali works that Beynon assembled himself to have in his bedroom where he spends each night with at least three women. Beynon says: \u0027I\u0027m a feminist. I have girls here that want to be models – I look after them and dress them and style them and make them feel beautiful. But I also employ women who I work with in the boardroom, in the corporate setting, and I would never ask them to come the mansion and wear bikinis\u0027          Attention to detail: Beynon says he enjoys choosing girls\u0027 outfits. He says: \u0027I have girls here that want to be models – I look after them and dress them and style them and make them feel beautiful.\u0027 He rejects any accusations that he is sexist and says he only tries to have as much fun in life as possible          Well-read: In his boardroom, Beynon has dozens of books, mostly on motivation, management and leadership. But he also has the writings of his idol, Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace.

Beynon says he spends time with his older children in the boardroom when they come home from school and university. There they discuss their lives and and any problems. Beynon\u0027s son, 19, is at university but also works for Free Choice He strides into his boardroom from where he runs his business empire in the afternoons and evenings. A large table surrounded by throne-like blue and gold chairs sits opposite his desk supporting a flat screen TV, a golden calculator and golden tissue box. Behind the desk is a cabinet full of books on leadership and management. \u0027When I came back from modelling in Miami, New York, London, Paris and Milan, I put my head down and learnt everything I could about business,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027I read my first book when I was 26 and now I\u0027ve read every one in this cabinet.\u0027He designed the wooden floor himself with glass panels so he can see his cars in the garage below. \u0027This won Australian Residential Floor Of The Year,\u0027 he says proudly, pointing to the framed certificate on the wall.Next he heads downstairs and through a new part of the house called the ballroom, which is being renovated to host lavish dinner parties and masquerade-style dances.He wanders outside to a sprawling garden which overlooks the river. \u0027This is where the wild parties happen,\u0027 he says, pointing to the swimming pool with a bar, a \u0027grotto\u0027, and tiles he designed himself lined with 24-karat gold. Looming over the water is a seven-tonne marble statue of Poseidon. \u0027He\u0027s not just the protector of the ocean but also of my pool,\u0027 says Beynon as he points to walls lined with re-creations of Paolo Veronese\u0027s The Wedding At Cana and Michelangelo\u0027s The Creation Of Adam.          A throne fit for a king: Beynon\u0027s two idols are Gianni Versace and Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy and editor-in-chief of the notorious men\u0027s magazine, which began in 1953. Beynon says of his racy Instagram snaps: \u0027The photos are tongue in cheek – we’re having a lot of fun and we’re taking the piss out of this world because it’s so sensitive now.\u0027          The entrance: The enormous gates of the Candy Mansion are flanked by two classical-inspired statues set against gold backgrounds. Beynon says he rolls out of his kingsize bed and goes for a 50km bike ride every morning before work          The open-plan kitchen: This is where the Candyman entertains up to 30 women every Friday night. He says \u0027we get the tequila it\u0027s pretty wild.\u0027 Beynon works from home in his boardroom where he sometimes has dinner with his two older children from his previous marriage          Family man: Beynon says his girlfriends are like aunties to the kids: \u0027We\u0027re a massive family. Every Sunday night we all sit at the family table, it’s a rule of mine – no phones, we get takeaway, they can’t be at their friends\u0027 and we have dinner.\u0027          Playboy: Beynon poses on the edge of his pool. He then points to a pontoon leading out into the river where his speedboat is moored. \u0027That\u0027s my new cigarette boat, she has 200 horsepower and absolutely hammers.\u0027          Suave: Beynon poses next to his Rolls Royce Phantom coupe. He says: \u0027The first rule of being successful, is put yourself around someone who us successful. These younger girls who are in their 20s are around me and they’re watching me hustle and they’re learning from the way I am, the way I manage people.\u0027          Time for a film: The Candyman poses in his home cinema. He says of his favourite films: \u0027They all have meanings for me, for example I relate to the part in Rocky IV where the crowd turn against him he never gives up and they start to cheer for him at the end. That\u0027s what I feel with the hate towards me. Once people get to know me, the won\u0027t feel the same\u0027          Doting son: Beynon has installed a lift in preparation for when his moves his elderly father into the mansion to take care of him. He is pictured here holding a stripper pole in his bedroom. He says on Friday nights he turns his bedroom into a club          The post that caused the most outrage was one of him holding his wife Taesha and another girlfriend by the bikini straps as they crawl at his feet          As the criticism flooded in, he responded in the only way he knows how - by fighting fire with fire and posting this photo\u0027The photos are tongue in cheek – we\u0027re having a lot of fun and we\u0027re taking the piss out of this world because it\u0027s so sensitive now. When I was a kid I was taught stick and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me.\u0027Now they’re teaching kids names hurt so it make people more sensitive and people are getting so upset by words that more and more are having breakdowns.\u0027 The post that caused the most outrage was one of him holding his wife Taesha and another girlfriend by the bikini straps as they crawled at his feet.As the criticism flooded in, he responded in the only way he knows how - by fighting fire with fire.\u0027When people who saw that photo started lying that I used a dog collar and and lead on the girls, I turned around and I stood on my balcony holding 13 girls on leads. I took a photo as a f*** you.\u0027\u0027If you\u0027re going to provoke me and you\u0027re going to talk shit about me – be prepared for a war.\u0027   Beynon weighed in on the ball tampering scandal that has rocked world cricket with a racy Instagram post featuring his wife (centre) and girlfriendsBeynon said he only aims to \u0027have fun\u0027 with the photos and in life generally. He reeled off the example of his recent mocking of the Australian cricket cheating scandal.  He posted a photo of himself in cricket whites alongside three almost-naked women, who wore small pieces of yellow tape after the Australian team used it to tamper with the ball against South Africa.He said: \u0027I’m having fun – just like in the cricket photo. What they did was cheat, what a disgrace. So in true English or Australian humour we take the p*** out of them. It’s part of our culture. \u0027Sitting around the family table we take the p*** out of each other – no-one\u0027s sensitive. You have to have fun. The girls were laughing non-stop for five minutes when we did the cricket photo.\u0027He added: \u0027Life is tough, business is tough and everyone needs to lighten up a bit.\u0027When someone says I’m sexist it inspires me to come up with something sexist. So if they were smart, they\u0027d leave me alone. Because if they push me, I will bite and I will come back bigger and stronger.\u0027                         Beynon walks through the kitchen to the home cinema, kitted out with multiple light settings, rows of red leather chairs that fully recline and a four-metre bed \u0027for when it\u0027s just me and the girls\u0027. On the back wall are posters of his eight favorite movies: The Godfather, The Dark Knight Rises, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Scarface, Rocky IV, The Great Gatsby, Ironman, and Fifty Shades Of Grey.He says: \u0027They all have meanings for me. For example, I relate to the part in Rocky IV where the crowd turn against him but he never gives up and they start to cheer for him at the end. \u0027That\u0027s what I feel with the hate towards me. Once people get to know me, they won\u0027t feel the same – they say I\u0027m a sexist and a misogynist but I\u0027m not, I\u0027m having fun and I don\u0027t care what they say: I\u0027m authentic and I won\u0027t change the way I am.He continues: \u0027The Wolf Of Wall Street represents my wild side - no-one parties like I do. And I love The Great Gatsby because there\u0027s nothing that makes me as happy as when I\u0027m entertaining guests. My parties are out of control – there\u0027s nothing like them on this planet.\u0027Beynon leaves the cinema room and walks back past his Napoleon portrait and upstairs to the master bedroom, where he shares king-size beds with at least three women every night.          Responding to his critics who call him sexist, Beynon says: \u0027The girls in my life know I’m not a sexist. I idolise, I adore women, I respect them at a corporate level and I respect them on a personal level – but I take the piss out of anyone who wants to have a go at them or me\u0027  Hedonist: \u0027Life is tough, business is tough, it’s like a pressure cooker,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027Everyone needs to lighten up a bit sometimes \u0027cause that pressure is going to explode. You have to have a valve that releases all that so how do you do that? By laughing\u0027          Everywhere gold: The Candy Shop Mansion is full to the brim with ostentatious furniture including these red sofas next to a chess board with silver and gold pieces. This room also boasts a chandelier and and two classical-inspired statues          Motorhead: The Candyman loves racing cars. Last year he was seen taking part in Shannon\u0027s National GT Australia Trophy series at Sandown Park, Victoria.

And when the haters have a go at me, my next move is to put these on\u0027, he says grabbing a pair of Versace silver gladiator-style knee-high sandals and placing them triumphantly on the table  Left: Beynon\u0027s portrait of Napoleon sits next to posters of his favourite film characters. Right: A picture montage of his late mother Sam leans against a fireplace. \u0027She passed away in 2015,\u0027 Beynon says. \u0027I miss her terribly, she was an incredibly strong woman.\u0027 There are also photos of his teenage son and daughter from a previous marriage to Venezuelan Miss World winner Ninibeth Leal which ended with a messy orce and judge granting him sole custodyThere are two bathrooms - one for him and one for the women - and a make-up area where the women each have their own mirror and set of drawers containing all the beauty products under the sun.The ceiling above the bed is mirrored and on the wall is a staggering Salvador Dali collage which he put together himself. Leaning against the wall is a sword: \u0027I never know when I may have to defend my girls,\u0027 Beynon explains.\u0027The craziest nights of my life have been in this bedroom,\u0027 says Beynon. \u0027On Fridays we get a stripper pole, smoke machine and bring the DJ up to turn it into a nightclub.\u0027                             It\u0027s two sides of a single coin. You have Travers Beynon - the entrepreneur, the family man. On the other side you have The Candyman – the entertainer, the playboy\u0027                         Beynon on his two personalities Talking about sharing his bed with so many women, he adds: \u0027I make Fifty Shades Of Grey look like a kindergarten. I fell asleep in that movie, I took the girls and we were thinking is it gonna get serious or what? I\u0027m just non-stop, I\u0027m f***ing nuts.\u0027Next to the bedroom is a huge walk-in wardrobe where he keeps more than 100 pairs of shoes, countless shirts and jackets and a range of Gucci and Versace watches, protected by bulletproof glass.Pulling out a pair of golden Louis Vuittons with red souls, he jokes: \u0027You don\u0027t wear these if you\u0027re sensitive to hate and abuse.\u0027And when the haters have a go at me, my next move is to put these on\u0027, he says, grabbing a pair of Versace silver gladiator-style sandals and placing them triumphantly on the table. There are also handbags, dresses and dozens of pairs of high heels for his wife. \u0027I buy all the girls their clothes and pick out all their outfits,\u0027 Beynon explains. \u0027When we go on holiday I plan their outfits down to the detail of their eye makeup.\u0027Beynon then walks downstairs and outside into his courtyard. Turning to admire his home, he says: \u0027This mansion represents what I\u0027m all about. It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s flamboyant, it\u0027s out there and it\u0027s over the top.\u0027Travers Beynon is certainly all of those things.           Plush: In the wardrobe there are also handbags, dresses and dozens of pairs of high heels for his wife. \u0027I buy all the girls their clothes and pick out all their outfits,\u0027 Beynon explains. \u0027When we go on holiday I plan their outfits down to the detail of their eye makeup.\u0027          Poser: The Candyman is not camera shy after a decade-long career in modelling which took him around the world to Miami, New York, London, Paris and Milan. He modelled for several big named brands including Calvin Klein          Unusual: Beynon strolls inside to the main entertainment room adjacent to the pool. There is a mosaic of Versace\u0027s face on the floor - the first thing he had done to the house - and a picture montage of his late mother Sam leans against a fireplace  \u0027What we do in here is more extreme than porn\u0027: The Candyman\u0027s wife of eight years reveals how her four-way relationship with him and two girlfriends works inside and outside the bedroom - and says she NEVER feels degraded or objectified   The Candyman has been married to Taesha, 27, for eight years after they met at one of his lavish parties.Her disapproving parents disowned her but she now has two children of her own with the husband she shares with up to 30 other women.Here, in her own words, she tells Daily Mail Australia her story and hits back at her fiercest critics.I used to do promotional modelling and Trav hired me at one of his parties in 2009. When I first met him I felt instantly there was a spark there but he was avoiding me and ignoring me so I had to work for his affection. A couple of months later I was running and he was cycling and we met on the same bike track.There were a few smiles and then he stopped to talk one time. I was with my mum and I hardly said anything because I was so nervous and just let my mum do the talking.           The wives and girlfriends: Beynon on his king-sized bed with wife Taesha (centre), girlfriend Krystal (left) and girlfriend Nisha (right). Taesha says: \u0027When we starting dating I didn\u0027t know he was going to have other girlfriends as well as me but it was something that we discussed together - it wasn\u0027t him saying this is what\u0027s going to happen \u0027He was at one of the nightclubs to promote his mate\u0027s party and we saw each other there. I was up on a balcony and he told me that I had a really fat a*se.I was like \u0027what the hell - this guy that I like is telling me that I\u0027m fat\u0027. I went to speak to him and he said \u0027you have a really fat a*se in that dress\u0027 and I thought \u0027oh my god\u0027.                            We have a very experimental sex life - it\u0027s extreme                         Taesha Beynon on sharing her marital bed with up to 30 women We were flirting and I was talking close to his ear and he was telling me that I was spitting in his ear and making me really nervous and making it worse - it was so embarrassing.But then we started talking about modelling and he said \u0027I can help you with your portfolio\u0027 and we exchanged numbers.Not long after that I went his place and it happened from there - but it took about four to six months of working to try to get him.When we started dating I didn\u0027t know he was going to have other girlfriends as well as me but it was something that we discussed together - it wasn\u0027t him saying \u0027this is what\u0027s going to happen\u0027.We\u0027d been together for a couple of years when we started to bring in other girls.          Friday night: The Candyman is pictured in his home with his wife Taesha (second right in white) and his girlfriend Nisha (left)  The lift or the stairs? Beynon shared these racy Instagram snaps of him and his wives and girlfriends heading to bed. Taesha says: \u0027What girl doesn\u0027t like to be handcuffed and thrown on the bed? It\u0027s so plain these days people need to spice it up.\u0027 I kissed girls when I was younger and have always been curious so we were both keen to try it out and see how it went and it evolved from there.We have a very experimental sex life - it\u0027s extreme. I haven\u0027t watched porn or anything like that but even if you were to watch porn I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything compared to what we get up to.Trav makes us feel comfortable to come out of our shells, to experiment with each other and with him. He is crazy but he definitely has a softer side which is what keeps us close. Regarding the other girls, I\u0027ve had my time with jealousy and you get past it. Trav and I have a very strong marriage and a very strong relationship - we make enough time to spend one on one together. I feel like I\u0027m always the centre of his life.To anyone who says Travers degrades women or is disrespectful to women, I say that they don\u0027t know what he\u0027s actually like. I never feel degraded - what we do is fun. Which girl doesn\u0027t like to be handcuffed and thrown on the bed? Sex is so plain these days, people need to spice it up.           Taesha says: \u0027On Fridays and Saturdays it\u0027s crazy - we have heaps of girls over and I love meeting new girls.

Some can be too attention-seeking and others are really fun and cool and we invite those ones back. My parents don\u0027t like Travers and I have nothing to do with them now. They loved him at the start but then my dad asked him for $2.8million for one of his building projects and Trav refused. They have hated him since then and said the worst things about him like \u0027I wish he were dead\u0027. I was a month out of giving birth to my first child and that was it, we stopped talking to the whole family. It was tough but it was the right decision.I didn\u0027t want anything to do with them, I didn\u0027t want my children to have anything to do with them and I\u0027m so glad I don\u0027t talk to them or see them anymore. I picked Travers instead of them and I haven\u0027t spoken to them since. It\u0027s done now.Now we have good times all the time, even just waking up next to him and cuddling him, I love times like that.   I\u0027m hoping to be with Trav for the rest of my life and have more children with him. Plucky little fox plays chase with much larger dogDublin protest against rugby players being cleared of rapeRacist bus passenger tells black man he \u0027shouldn\u0027t be here\u0027Holidaymakers have travel delayed as shuttle bus catches on fireRussian factory believed to have produced the Skripal nerve agentMember of Katie Price\u0027s film crew with black eye after robberySickening moment footy star snaps leg after slamming into goalpostPeople brave cold to go out the night before Good FridayBritish woman returns after getting lost in Brazilian rainforestShocking final hours of an elephant\u0027s life in captivity in IndiaShakira Martin re-elected NUS President with this speech    Party time: Beynon and Taesha at his Freaks Unleashed bash in December.

And yes, it still fits - even after giving birth to three childrenJessica, dubbed ‘Canadian royalty’ and ‘the Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’, is said to have her perfectly manicured fingertips on the minutiae of her friend’s big day, from helping choose the bridal gown to picking the guests.There’s just one little niggle. For seasoned Royal watchers are wondering whether Jessica, 37, might be so glamorous, there’s a risk she’ll overshadow Meghan – just as Pippa Middleton and her impossibly pert posterior took centre stage when she was bridesmaid at Kate’s marriage to William.EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Markle\u0027s \u0027first kiss\u0027 - and how she \u0027held...Share this article‘Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable,’ a friend told The Mail on Sunday.‘Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her. The irony is Meghan could end up being upstaged by the woman she’s fashioned herself on.’          My little army of helpers: It\u0027s a tight schedule getting everyone to school on time in the morning, so it\u0027s worth planning outfits in advance. What better accessories than co-ordinating seven-year-old twins?          Hey kids, DO try this at home: Now it\u0027s time to get the finely honed midriff out for another impossible-looking workout - this one is just \u0027fun\u0027, says Jessica, although it\u0027s \u0027not for the faint-hearted\u0027It is not merely Jessica’s soignee appearance that appears to have caught Meghan’s eye, for the merest glance at Jessica’s Instagram feed (scrutinised by 100,000 followers) reveals a life of domestic perfection. It has certainly given Meghan something to aim for.Born Jessica Brownstein in Montreal, she had a privileged start as a member of Canada’s Browns shoes dynasty, worth a reported £50 million. She attended an exclusive all-girls’ school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics –skills she used to good effect when she launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.          No-one comes between me and my pal: Ripped jeans, glossy hair, black T-shirts – it’s almost like we’re identical twins. Or maybe I’m her stylist?          Hurrah! It\u0027s water o\u0027clock: Everyone asks how I manage it all. Well by 5pm even I need to pour myself a glass of something chilled. But you don\u0027t look this good by opting for Chablis - make mine a sparkling mineral water. Yummy!Later, she would make a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, but it was her 2007 marriage to Ben Mulroney, son of former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and one of Canada’s top television presenters, that propelled her on to the A-list.Today Jessica and her husband lead an affluent, yoga-toned life, that appears to be lifted from the pages of a magazine.Jessica regularly posts ‘inspirational’ fitness videos and pictures on Instagram – she and Meghan bonded over a ‘deep passion’ for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.They first met when Meghan arrived in Toronto in 2011 to film Suits. Until then, the aspiring actress had been something of a ‘rough diamond’, but soon her style began to mirror her friend’s.‘Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,’ as one of their circle put it. An even closes friendship duly blossomed          Want a clue on Meg\u0027s big day? Time for my close-up - as a TV bridal expert. Whether you want to look mermaid or Meringue, I can find the perfect dress for your big day. Just ask Meghan!Before she took down her blog called The Tig, Meghan frequently posted pictures of the two on holiday and proudly referred to herself as ‘Aunty Meg’ to Jessica’s children. And it was in Jessica’s house that Harry and Meghan sought refuge when news of their secret romance first became public in 2016. Jessica attended Meghan’s recent Church of England baptism and has been closely involved in preparing for the wedding. She flew to Britain in January to attend the first fitting of the wedding dress and plans to return twice more before the ceremony in May.Her children, twins Brian and John, seven, and daughter Ivy, five, are even tipped to be page boys and bridesmaid alongside Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Certainly, if Meghan needs any domestic tips on leading an impeccably stylish and organised life with children in tow, she knows where to turn. But she should beware – it involves 5am starts and doing everything in heels.‘Jess is up early every morning, usually around 5am when Ben leaves the house, to make lunches for the kids and get them ready for the day,’ a friend remarked.‘After the kids are in school or kindergarten, she either goes straight to meetings or her television job. After that she usually works out and then is home in time for the kids when they return from school. They often cook together. And she will do all of this in heels.’A source added: ‘Everyone is betting on Jessica as Maid of Honour, but she’s giving nothing away.’And if she’s not, that’s only because she’ll be too busy planning every last detail. ‘The one thing you can be certain of is that Meghan’s wedding will be perfect… just like Jessica.’Meghan will, no doubt, be hoping all eyes stay firmly on the bride. "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565635/DARA-BRIAIN-never-Strictly-did-win-it.html","title":"DARA Ó BRIAIN: I could never do Strictly... but if I did I would win it","story":"    Comedian Dara Ó Briain, 46, pictured, has been described as \u0027Britain\u0027s favourite Irishman\u0027          Dara, pictured yesterday at Stephen Hawkin\u0027s funeral, got to meet the acclaimed scientist before he died - and even owns a signed copy of his book, A Brief History Of TimeMeet your heroes.

But his no-nonsense nanny Veronica Crook may just have let the cat out of the bag.‘He would make an excellent Prime Minister,’ she said without hesitation, when we bumped into her after interviewing the man whose nappies she used to change.Miss Crook had come to the Tory MP’s Westminster office so that he could drive her to Gournay Court, his pile in Somerset, where she is nanny to his six children, just as she was to Jacob nearly 50 years ago. ‘He was as good as gold as a little boy and he hasn’t changed a bit,’ she said.The popularity among dukes to dustmen of the languid Old Etonian Brexiteer who has stepped straight out of a Victorian ‘Spy’ cartoon has taken most by surprise.Blair, Clinton, Obama and Cameron all vied to be tieless and trendy. Rees-Mogg, with his double-breasted suits and Latin quotations, does the opposite.Ask him who is the England football manager: ‘Not a clue.’                            Who is the England manager? I haven\u0027t a clue                         Name a rap star: ‘No idea.’Does he ever eff and blind? ‘No, never. The worst I say is damn. I’m trying to bring the term blighter back into fashion.’With no Cabinet responsibility and millions in the bank from a successful City career, he can afford to speak his mind. And does. For all his politesse, he fires off militant letters to Mrs May telling her what he will and won’t accept in Brexit talks.Six months ago, Rees-Mogg was still a novelty act. Now many at Westminster believe that if he got to the last stage of the Conservative leadership contest, whereby party members choose between the top two MPs, Rees-Mogg would steal the show. He gave new and surprising insights into his personal and political life in his interview with this newspaper in which he:          Rees-Mogg posted this picture of his family on Instragram with the caption: On the way to the Eve of Christmas mass with the troops, Thomas is already in the carl Issued a heartfelt new call for the ban on Catholics becoming monarchs to be scrappedl Confessed he got away with driving at 100mph and lets his two-year-old son drive his Jaguarl Admitted that he could have been a devout Muslim instead of a CatholicGavin Williamson and Toff hold secret meeting: Defence...\u0027She was told not to worry\u0027: Britain\u0027s youngest Tory...Share this articlel Rejects Left-wing jibes that he is a ‘fascist’, saying he is against corporal and capital punishmentl Said he had never been ‘really drunk’.Rees-Mogg’s hardline views on Europe are well known but he is a softie as a dad. ‘I wasn’t smacked and I don’t want my children hit,’ he said. ‘If you want to hit your children, it is usually because you have lost control.’He leaves it to wife Helena to keep order. ‘I’m wet but she sticks to what she says. When they have a go at me for two minutes I say, “All right, then.” Nanny is pleased if they’re in bed when I get home or else they all start racing about.’          Jacob Rees-Mogg is the bookies’ favourite to succeed Theresa May as Tory leaderLiterally in the case of two-year-old Alfred. Dad lets him sit on his knee in his Jag as they cruise up and down the driveway of their home. ‘He holds the steering wheel while I do the accelerator,’ he revealed. ‘If I put my hands on the wheel, he says, “No, Alfred do it.” As soon as I get home, he says “Daddy, car!” and we toddle out.’Rees-Mogg’s unblinking faith in Brexit is matched by a passionate religious conviction which dates back to his upbringing as a Catholic. Had he ever wondered if he would have been a devout Muslim if he had been raised by a Muslim family? ‘There’s a lot of truth in that,’ he said.He rails against the arbitrary power of Brussels bureaucrats but has no qualms about the untrammelled authority wielded in another European capital, Rome. He likes the ‘clearly set out dogmas’ of the Catholic Church. ‘If a Pope has a disagreement with a cardinal he just moves him, it’s easy,’ he said with a chuckle.Rees-Mogg said his faith stems from the Resurrection.‘If you believe Christ died on the cross and rose again on the third day, there’s no miracle greater than that. If that is true, it’s easy to believe the rest of the Church’s teaching. If it’s not, everything else is a waste of time.’How could he be so sure?‘Because St Peter was willing to be martyred, crucified upside down, because he had seen the Resurrection.’ But the men who blew up the Twin Towers and the London Underground claimed to be martyrs too.‘They weren’t martyrs, they were evil, delusional mass murderers,’ he said. This time there was no Bertie Woosterish smile playing on his lips. Rees-Mogg’s strict Catholic orthodoxy caused controversy when he said he opposed all abortion, including for rape victims.Shortly before our interview, a friend of the MP suggested privately that Rees-Mogg also believes in another Catholic tenet – that there should be no sex before marriage. He duly confirmed he and Helena did not live together before they married in 2007, when he was aged 38. However, when pressed further, Rees-Mogg rebuffed us with a firm: ‘I am not discussing private and intimate matters.’He is uneasy about some aspects of the transgender rights debate.‘If you have people who have no intention of changing sex but think it would be fun to go into the women’s changing room, we cannot ignore that.’And he takes issue with Guardian pundit Suzanne Moore, who called him a ‘semi fascist in tweed’.‘I’m very far from being a fascist,’ he said, with the same Zen-like calm he displayed when he refused to be intimidated by Left-wing thugs at a meeting at a university in Bristol last month.                            Bombers are not martyrs - they are evil murderers                         ‘I’m not some hard-nosed Right-wing authoritarian,’ he said. ‘I’m against corporal and capital punishment. I believe in giving people sent to prison a second chance.’Mrs May was mocked for saying the naughtiest thing she had done was to run through a wheat field. Rees-Mogg, who owns two classic Bentleys as well as the Jag (he calls it his ‘day car’), nervously confessed he once drove at 100mph on a British motorway without getting caught – ‘this is dangerous territory, one doesn’t want to show off or be a total wuss’ – and has had ‘two or three’ speeding fines.He has never used the F-word –‘at least not as an adult’ – and has ‘never drunk so much that I can’t remember what happened the night before’.Rees-Mogg compares Brexit to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the birth of modern parliamentary sovereignty. It is an interesting parallel. The Glorious Revolution also saw Catholic James II thrown out, the Crown given to Protestant William of Orange from the European mainland, partly to boost trade (sound familiar?), and Catholics banned from becoming the monarch.Rees-Mogg has tried to reassure non-believers alarmed by his deeply held religious convictions on issues like abortion and rape, saying they would not affect his policies if he ever got into power.However, there could be an exception. His fierce Catholic pride was hurt when the ban on the monarch’s female offspring having equal rights to succeed to the throne was lifted in 2013, while his call for the ban on Catholics to be lifted was rejected.‘It was unfriendly to the Catholic Church to say women must not be discriminated against but it’s fine that Catholics are. It should have been updated for everyone.’It could lead to an interesting conversation in his first audience with the Queen – the Head of the Church of England – if Rees-Mogg ever inherits Mrs May’s Tory crown."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5565779/Harry-Meghan-choose-fashionable-London-based-florist-Philippa-Craddock.html","title":"Harry and Meghan choose fashionable London-based florist Philippa Craddock","story":"    Harry and Meghan have appointed society favourite Philippa Craddock (pictured), known for her work with brands such as Alexander McQueen, Dior and Vogue, to oversee the event          Kensington Palace posted a string of tweets officially announcing Ms Craddock\u0027s appointment to the coveted role this morningThe tweets read: \u0027Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen floral designer Philippa Craddock to create the church flowers for their wedding.\u0027The floral displays in St George\u0027s Chapel will be created using locally sourced foliage, much of which will be taken from the gardens and parkland of The Crown Estate and @WindsorGtPark. A third tweet continued: \u0027Where possible, Philippa will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May, including branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, as well as white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves.\u0027@RoyalParks will supply some pollinator-friendly plants from their wildflower meadows that will be incorporated into the floral designs.

Christian Real Easter EggsSainsbury\u0027s has been criticised for refusing to join other major supermarkets in selling an Easter egg that comes with a booklet telling the story of the death and Resurrection of Jesus.Tesco, Morrisons and Asda stocked the overtly Christian Real Easter Eggs, and critics say Sainsbury’s should have given customers the chance to choose an egg with a religious message alongside treats promoting the likes of Darth Vadar and Postman Pat.The Bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, said it was ‘important that retailers acknowledge and cater for the culture and celebrations of all their customers’. It follows fears that organisations are marginalising Christianity to avoid upsetting other faiths.Sainsbury’s insiders said the decision not to stock the £3.99 chocolate eggs was based on trials that suggested there was little demand from customers.A company spokesman said: ‘We’re an inclusive retailer and regularly review all our ranges based on customer demand.’ "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5566199/Meghan-Markle-sees-Diana-role-model-dumped-ex-husband-POST-mailed-rings.html","title":"Meghan Markle sees Diana as a role model","story":"    Meghan dumped her producer husband Trevor Engleson (pictured) by post and mailed him the wedding rings back The book - which is being serialised by The Sun on Sunday - features a former friend\u0027s claims that the Suits star is a social climber who left Engleson in a \u0027cold fury\u0027 that still surfaces five years later.Describing Meghan as \u0027controlling\u0027 and \u0027fastidious\u0027 the biography says she grew tired of her husband\u0027s \u0027scattered approach to life\u0027 while she starred in the legal drama.

The average life expectancy in the air was just 15 minutes.Speaking of his time there, he said: \u0027We knew we might not come back and that each moment could be your last, but we were young and we accepted it.\u0027When the battle started, the adrenaline flowed. But we had Spitfires. It was a beautiful aircraft. You’d feel it instinctively. It felt like it was part of you. Flying a Spitfire came to me very naturally.\u0027 Now Mr Scott is an ambassador for the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, a charity that helps veterans with housing adaptations, mobility aids and even financial assistant.            Former Spitfire pilot Allan Scott, 96, stands near the iconic aircraft as part of the 100th centenary celebration of the Royal Air Force  Mr Scott gives the thumbs up from inside the Spitfire (left), and the war hero stands on the runway with the Spitfire primed (right)          The former squadron leader takes to the sky once more at the age of 96 in an iconic Spitfire - 77 years after shooting down his first German bomber          Celebrations have begun for the Royal Air Force as they mark the 100th birthday of the world\u0027s first air force.

But I do that on behalf of everybody in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Air Force family.\u0027After the talk at the Strand, there was a service at St Clement Danes Church, in London. The church was heavily damaged in 1941 during the Blitz.

All we had was a map and a pencil.\u0027Air Commodore Charles Clarke, 94, also joined the RAF at the age of 17 - flying in Lancasters as a bomb aimer in 619 squadron.Asked what it was like during the bombing sorties, he said: \u0027You never thought it was going to happen to you, you never thought you were going to be selected or shot down.\u0027You couldn\u0027t help feeling a bit tense... if you thought too much about it, you\u0027d be frightened.\u0027The survival didn\u0027t depend entirely on your skill or the skill of the crew, however good you were, survival was a matter of luck.\u0027It was during a sortie in early 1944 that his aircraft was hit by enemy fire, forcing him to parachute out of the plane, that he said was on fire and \u0027the wing was falling off\u0027.He was then captured by the Nazis and taken to Stalag Luft III after being interrogated.The infamous camp in Poland was where Allied PoWs constructed tunnels and attempted to make a daring bid for freedom in March 1944 - known as the Great Escape.But it was in January 1945 that Air Cdre Clarke was evacuated from the prison as Allied Forces advanced, and ordered on the long march with other PoWs by the Nazis before being rescued.Air Cdre Clarke said he is \u0027very impressed\u0027 by the current RAF, and added: \u0027If anything else they have much longer training and more professional training.\u0027We had so little... even as far as parachuting was concerned, the only training I had was to jump off a six foot ladder onto a pile of straw - once, not even twice.\u0027It is really hard to believe.\u0027                                                    RAF fighter ace Allan Scott will fly a Spitfire again at the age of 96"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5567271/Cynthia-Nixon-voters-Im-actor.html","title":"Cynthia Nixon explains why challenging Andrew Cuomo","story":"Sex and the Citys tar Cynthia Nixon said she\u0027s challenging New York\u0027s incumbent governor in the Democratic primary because he hasn\u0027t addressed inequalities in schools, plus other things Nixon is seen here in New York City on  March 20Nixon said she is not phased by questions about whether she has the experience necessary to lead one of the nation\u0027s biggest states.Similarly, when asked about polls showing Nixon trailing Cuomo by a large margin, Nixon told the AP she was undaunted.A poll released on March 19 by Siena College showed registered Democrats favored Cuomo by a ratio of of 66-19 percent.
