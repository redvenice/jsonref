Many experts want a newly rebuilt spire to be exactly like the original, whilst French President Emanuel Macron is arguing for an innovative solution.But many see the spire, a late addition to the mediaeval cathedral designed by the 19th-century French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, as an integral part of the building.\u0027It needs to be rebuilt as it was before,\u0027 opined Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of restoring the cathedral, arguing that the sheer power of the spire integrated it with the mediaeval church.Villeneuve\u0027s opinion is backed by the descendants of Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who designed the spire.The French public concur, opinion polls indicate.The government has also not ruled out the possibility of an international competition for architects to design something new.It is only at the end of 2020 that a complete check will allow architects to work out how to restore the cathedral. No reconstruction is expected to start before 2021.              Notre Dame suffered a major fire in April 2019, though Emanuel Macron said that he wants the rebuilding work completed by 2024.Experts are also intensively researching the precise original architecture of the cathedral, so that when reconstruction begins it is as accurate as possible.\u0027Before 2010, we only have old-style surveys, plans that have been redrawn on numerous occasions which are very partial and very imprecise,\u0027 said Remi Fromont, one of the architects responsible for the site who is working on drawing up accurate plans.Andrew Tallon, a Belgium-born scholar who died aged 49 in November 2018, carried out hugely valuable laser scans of the interior in 2010 that have proved an even more valuable legacy than he could have imagined.\u0027We know that we will have shortcomings. Not all the chapels were systematically scanned. There are still areas of doubt,\u0027 Fromont said.Price tag for the work is also an issue, and it is impossible at this stage to say \u0027how much this is going to cost, how long this is going to last,\u0027 said Michel Aupetit, the archbishop of Paris.Private iniduals and, above all, rich French co-operations rushed to pledge hundreds of millions for the cathedral\u0027s reconstruction.There were concerns whether this funding would ever be realised.But France\u0027s richest man Bernard Arnault in September signed a formal accord over his pledge for £180 million ($220 million), as did the Pinault family for their promised £90 million ($110 million).A signing on another £90 million ($99.2 million) promised by the oil giant Total is expected in October.The consortium of fundraising groups behind the drive believes that £720 million ($881 million) can be raised in total, with over £554 million ($678 million) now either transferred or pledged.Lovers of the historic masterpiece, be they tourists, architecture buffs or worshippers, may have to wait some time before Notre-Dame becomes theirs again.\u0027I have felt myself orphaned, it is like being in mourning,\u0027 said Michele Chevalier, 70, a regular at Notre-Dame who was at the service when the first evacuation took place.\u0027I still manage to pray, but it\u0027s not the same.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Slackliner balances one legged does yoga ROPE 1 000 feet Moscow","story":"Share this article            Athletes from Russia, Germany, France and Canada walked at a nauseating height of 1,140ft - a hundred feet higher than London\u0027s Shard. The group smashed the previous record by 330ft          Pictured: Genady Skripco in Moscow.

As this picture shows, he’s playful – an entertainer who’s game for pretty much anything.I shoot on a Widelux, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout “shift!” at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn’t move across or anything, they just turn their head.This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it’s a way of me exploring what is to be an actor, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being – the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations.I’ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad’s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I’ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since.I started shooting on set during the filming of King Kong in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion.I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn’t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I’ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity – it’s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions.Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you’re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry.I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together. Usually, at the first script reading or the producers’ meeting, I’ll ask if people are OK with me shooting backstage. They tend to be pretty cool with it.But it felt as if I should share the work with the world. It’s a way of giving something back to the motion picture industry that has been such a wonderful home to me for decades.• Jeff Bridges: Pictures Volume 2 is published by powerHouse Books on 15 October.High point: “The joy of developing an image that completely exceeds your expectations.”Low point: “Getting your photos and finding that they’re disappointing or not quite right, somehow.”Top tip: “Keep your fingers out of the shot!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f06075ec0e60c45a6e1a884b0f535ba597408f/91_55_3701_2221/master/3701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff755cf3418a02351fc243c47636511","title":"lost chapter the tale of genji murasaki shikibu found japan","story":"A fifth part of The Tale of Genji, which was completed around 1010 by a woman later named Murasaki Shikibu, has been found in a house in TokyoThe oldest written copy of part of the 11th-century Japanese epic The Tale of Genji, has been found in the home of a Tokyo family with ancestral ties to a feudal lord.Seen as the world’s first novel, The Tale of Genji was completed around 1010 by a woman of the 11th-century Heian court of Japan, who was later given the name Murasaki Shikibu by scholars. It centres on the fortunes – amorous and political – of Genji, the son of an emperor. The original manuscript of the story no longer exists, with the oldest versions of the story believed to have been transcribed by the poet Teika, who died in 1241.Until now, just four chapters of the 54-chapter story are confirmed to be Teika’s transcriptions, but now a fifth chapter, which depicts Genji’s encounter with the girl who becomes his wife, Murasaki, has also been identified as Teika’s. The manuscript had been kept in an oblong chest in a storeroom at the Tokyo home of Motofuyu Okochi, a descendant of the former feudal lord of the Mikawa-Yoshida Domain in Aichi Prefecture, the Japan Times reported.Experts at Reizeike Shiguretei Bunko, a foundation for the preservation of cultural heritage, have now confirmed its authenticity, with the handwriting of the text, and the cover of the manuscript, identical to other Teika manuscripts. The foundation said although the newly-found manuscript “mostly” matches the common version of the story, there are some grammatical differences.According to the Asahi Shimbun, family records show the manuscript has been in the hands of the Okochi family since 1743, when it was handed down from the Kuroda family of the Fukuoka feudal domain.Kyoto University professor Junko Yamamoto told the paper that previous research on the chapter has relied on manuscripts of The Tale of Genji that were completed about 250 years later. “It is very significant that this discovery of the manuscript edited by Teika will be available for researchers,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347782798d6793001850078bd4e12de805f617cf/0_54_2440_1464/master/2440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f9d2191eb8701bd052dbfc7986d3e7","title":"nobel prizes in literature olga tokarczuk peter handke 2019 2018","story":"The Swedish Academy announced laureates for 2018 and 2019, after scandal forced last year’s award to be postponedThe Polish novelist and activist Olga Tokarczuk and the controversial Austrian author Peter Handke have both won the Nobel prize in literature.The choice of Tokarczuk and Handke comes after the Swedish Academy promised to move away from the award’s “male-oriented” and “Eurocentric” past.Tokarczuk, an activist, public intellectual, and critic of Poland’s politics, won the 2018 award, and was cited by the committee for her “narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life”. She is a bestseller in her native Poland, and has become much better known in the UK after winning the International Booker prize for her sixth novel Flights. The Nobel committee’s Anders Olsson said her work, which “centres on migration and cultural transitions”, was “full of wit and cunning”.Picking Handke as 2019’s winner, cited for “an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience”, has already provoked controversy. The Ambassador of Kosovo to the US, Vlora Çitaku, called the decision “scandalous … a preposterous and shameful decision”.The Austrian playwright and novelist, who has Slovene origins on the maternal side, spoke at the 2006 funeral of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milošević, declaring “I don’t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milošević.” After widespread criticism, he turned down a nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize before politicians could withdraw it over his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was also met by protests in Oslo.Perhaps more gallingly for the Nobel committee, Handke also called for the Nobel to be abolished in 2014, saying it was a “false canonisation” of literature. “The Nobel prize should finally be abolished,” he told Austrian newspaper Die Presse, adding that though it delivered “a moment of attention, six pages in the newspaper”, he did not admire the choices.The permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Mats Malm said both laureates had been informed of their win. Handke was at home, and Tokarczuk was on a reading tour in Germany and had to pull her car to the side of the road when she received the call.Handke, known particularly for the play Über die Dörfer (Walk about the Villages), the novel Die Wiederholung (Repetition), and the screenplay for Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire, is, according to Olsson, “one of the most influential writers of contemporary fiction, and part of the literary debate since 1966”, who “with great artistry explores the periphery and unseen places”.The Nobel committee acknowledged the issues surrounding Handke in their citation for the award, admitting that “he has, at times, caused controversy” but adding that “he cannot be considered an engaged writer in the sense of Sartre, and he gives us no political programs”.Handke’s pro-Milošević stance has seen him condemning “criminal” Nato intervention in Serbia, and claiming that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and had blamed this on the Serbs.According to Fiammetta Rocco, culture correspondent of The Economist and administrator of the International Booker Prize, the two winners should be seen “in context together”.“They have obviously very different writing styles but they do write about contested lands, about who owns memory, about the central human need to telling stories.” Rocco said. “Olga Tokarczuk of course is beloved by everybody except the hard Polish right, Peter Handke is not so beloved of everybody, except for the arch followers of Slobodan Milošević, but still they are both greatly admired for their formal work, for their imagination, for their use of language. There’s more in seeing them together than separately. The more I think about it the more I think it was a very conscious choice to pair these two writers together.”At Tokarczuk’s UK publisher Fitzcarraldo, a small independent press which also published 2015’s Nobel laureate, Svetlana Alexievich, Jacques Testard was about to speak to his printers to rush through reprints of her books Flights and Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Tokarczuk had not been published in the UK for some time when he approached her about taking on her work – he had wanted to find a Polish writer to publish in English in the wake of the Brexit referendum, and the violence against the Polish community which erupted. Tokarczuk, he said, was the clear choice.“She’s such a special writer – she has an incredible range,” he said. “She’s also a political activist and dissident, and a figurehead for a more progressive, feminist, environmental politics. She’s a public intellectual and doesn’t shy away from that.”In 2014, her Polish publisher had to hire bodyguards to protect her after she outraged right-wing patriots by saying that Poland had committed “horrendous acts” of colonisation in the past, leading to her being described as “targowiczanin” – an ancient term for traitor.The selections of Handke and Tokarczuk follow an unprecedented two years of scandal at the Swedish Academy. Last year’s prize was postponed because of the “reduced public confidence” that followed rape accusations made against Jean-Claude Arnault, the French husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson. Frostenson and six other members ended up leaving the Swedish Academy amid bitter rows over how the accusations were handled, and Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of laureates, is now in prison for rape.The prize is given to, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel: “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.” There have been 116 literature laureates to date – of whom just 15 are women. English is by far the most common language for Nobel laureates, with 29 winners writing in English, followed by 14 in French, 14 in German, 11 in Spanish and seven in Swedish.Olsson, who is chair of the Nobel prize in literature committee, admitted earlier this month that: “we had a more Eurocentric perspective on literature, and now we are looking all over the world.” Olsson also admitted to a “much more male-oriented” perspective in the past, which he said was changing.The Swedish Academy has long tended to veil the process for choosing its candidates in mystery, with its 18 members elected for life, and nominations of candidates not made public until 50 years have passed. Told to show “greater openness towards the outside world” by the Nobel Foundation, and charged with restoring its credibility, it now allows members to voluntarily resign, and has appointed seven new members, with Malm taking over from former permanent secretary Sara Danius, who was forced out during the Arnault scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9844cd49bafceeeffef6e4c38e8e2814fa70dbaa/0_0_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2a92b8f6c20ff3ffa229129a175795","title":"nobel prize in literature 2019 two laureates to be named live","story":"After the prize was postponed last year due to a sexual harassment scandal, two Nobel medals were awardedAnd there we leave the literature prize for another year. (Let’s assume it is now a yearly event.)Here is my colleague Alison Flood’s news story on the prize, which will be updated throughout the day as we get reactions:The 2019 Nobel peace prize will be announced on Friday at 11am CEST (10am BST).One of Olga Tokarczuk’s translators has been in touch: Jennifer Croft, who most recently translated Flights (which won the 2018 Man Booker International prize).Croft says: “I’m so thrilled for Olga and so excited for all the new readers who are bound to discover her delicate, powerful, beautifully nuanced novels and short stories thanks to the prize.”Handke also called for the Nobel to be abolished in 2014, saying it was a “false canonisation” of literature. The choice of Peter Handke seems incredibly strange, given the Nobel committee had shown so many indications of moving away from incendiary laureates.While initially left-leaning in his youth, his increasingly pro-Milosevic stance saw many writers distance themselves from him in the 1990s. After the end of the three-year Serbian siege of Sarajevo, he claimed that the Muslims had staged their own massacres in Sarajevo and had blamed this on the Serbs.Then, Alain Finkielkraut, the Paris intellectual, said Handke had become “an ideological monster”, while Slavoj Zizek – who is Slovene – said Handke’s “glorification of the Serbs is cynicism”. And Susan Sontag, who had spent several months in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war staging a performance of Waiting For Godot, said that Handke was now “finished” in New York.The Austrian playwright and author is a more controversial decision than Tokarczuk. His selection come days after the Swedish Academy promised to move away from the “male-oriented” and “Eurocentric” past of the Nobel prize in literature. Handke doesn’t change either of those directions.His bibliography contains novels, essays, note books, dramatic works and screenplays. He has lived in Paris since the 1990s, and is most famous for his play The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other (completely dialogue free), his screenwriting credit for Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire and particularly the novel Die Wiederholung (Repetition).Handke, who has Slovenic origins on the maternal side, famously gave a speech at the 2006 funeral of Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milošević, a decision that was criticised widely. His nomination for the Heinrich Heine prize that same year was eventually withdrawn due to his political views. His 2014 win of the International Ibsen award was also met by protests in Oslo. The Nobel committee have ended the press conference by confirming that both authors each win 9m Swedish krona (£746,678). “It is a full prize,” one judge said, slightly rattled that we haven’t all got the hang of this two prize thing yet.We’ve been told Tokarczuk is currently on the train in Germany. Blimey. Let’s hope they have some bubbly on board.Torkarczuk is a surprising, but an excellent choice. The judges are describing her as “a writer preoccupied by local life ... but looking at earth from above ... her work is full of wit and cunning.” Aside from her novels, which are wide-ranging and brilliantly translated into English by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and Jennifer Croft, she also has political heft. As public intellectual, feminist vegetarian, she has frequently rankled the conservative edges of Poland.In a television interview after she won the Nike award (Poland’s Booker equivalent), Tokarczuk outraged rightwing patriots by saying that, contrary to its self-image as a plucky survivor of oppression, Poland itself had committed “horrendous acts” of colonisation at times in its history. She was branded a “targowiczanin” – an ancient term for traitor – and her publisher had to hire bodyguards for a while to protect her.Read a recent interview with her here.The panel have emerged to explain their decision making. This is far more open process already than previous years.The 2018 Nobel has been awarded to the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk – who won the 2018 Man Booker International prize for her novel Flights – “for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.”The 2019 Nobel has been awarded to the Austrian author Peter Handke “for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.”With the head of the Swedish Academy promising to move away from the prize’s “male-oriented” past, its important to remember that only 14 women have won, compared with 113 men. Only one laureate – the late Toni Morrison – is a woman of colour.The 14 women who have won are:If you need a last minute refresher as to why we have two Nobel laureates this year, Jon Henley has produced this summary:The Swedish Academy, founded in 1786, is thought likely to try to avoid any controversy as it seeks to rebuild its reputation after the scandal exposed harassment, furious infighting, conflicts of interest and a culture of secrecy among its 18 members, who are elected for life and seen as the country’s s of culture.The poet Katarina Frostenson was among seven academy members who left the body after bitter rows over how to handle rape accusations made in 2017 against her husband, Frenchman Jean-Claude Arnault, who was also accused of leaking the names of several prize winners.The couple ran a cultural club in Stockholm that was part-funded by the academy, and several of the assaults committed by Arnault – who is now serving a prison sentence for rape – took place in academy-owned properties.The academy has since made changes that it says will improve transparency, including allowing members to voluntarily resign, which they could not previously do. It has also pledged to review its lifetime membership policy and appointed five members to its selection committee from outside the body.A late but worthy contender.You can watch it at the top of this liveblog. You can enjoy 10 minutes of nervous chatter among journalists.The Japanese novelist is a frequent frontrunner for the prize. Last year, he withdrew from the New Academy award – the one off replacement for the Nobel in 2018 – citing a wish to concentrate on his writing.Then, the New Academy said in a statement that Murakami had emailed them saying that it was a great honour to be shortlisted. But “Murakami then said his preference is to concentrate on his writing, away from media attention … The New Academy regrets but respects his decision.”Will he accept the Nobel if it finally comes his way this year? Fans certainly hope so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b555dbae9a410d93b0d60c500b7177cda0545ac4/902_146_2428_1457/master/2428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc4fa6f7f8ebcac2a08d73837e1e6389","title":"new 20 note featuring jmw turner revealed by the bank of england","story":"Polymer note billed as ‘most secure yet’ against forgery enters circulation in FebruaryThe governor of the Bank of England has unveiled the new £20 polymer banknote featuring the artist JMW Turner as the Bank continues its switch away from paper money.Mark Carney revealed the note’s design in Margate at Turner Contemporary gallery, which is named after the painter. Carney was joined by the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the Kent coastal town.Turner, the first artist to feature on a British banknote, went to school in Margate and many of his paintings were of the local seascapes. Turner Contemporary is on the site of the lodging house where he stayed when he returned to the town.The £20 note follows the Bank’s launch of polymer £5 and £10 notes, which went into circulation in September 2016 and September 2017 respectively. The Bank is opting for polymer over traditional paper notes because it is cleaner, longer-lasting and harder to forge.The Bank said the latest note was its most secure yet with two windows and a two-colour foil, making it difficult to counterfeit. The foil features Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and helped revive Margate as an artistic centre, in blue and the town’s lighthouse in gold.The note will enter circulation on 20 February alongside existing paper £20 notes, which will be phased out.The new polymer notes feature images of historic British figures, with Winston Churchill appearing on the £5 note and Jane Austen on the £10 note. A £50 note featuring the mathematician and second world war codebreaker Alan Turing will follow in 2021.William Shakespeare was the first historical character to appear on a Bank of England note in 1970. Here’s the full list of the historical characters that have appeared on banknotes issued by the central bank in England and Wales over the last five decades.1970 William Shakespeare, playwright (£20) 1971 Duke of Wellington, soldier and statesman (£5) 1975 Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing (£10) 1978 Sir Isaac Newton, physicist and mathematician (£1) 1981 Sir Christopher Wren, architect (£50) 1990 George Stephenson, engineer (£5) 1991 Michael Faraday, scientist (£20) 1992 Charles Dickens, author (£10) 1994 Sir John Houblon, first Bank of England governor (£50) 1999 Sir Edward Elgar, composer (£20) 2000 Charles Darwin, naturalist (£10)2002 Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer (£5)2007 Adam Smith, economist (£20)2011 Matthew Boulton and James Watt, steam engine industrialists (£50)2016 Winston Churchill, prime minister (£5)2017 Jane Austen, author (£10)Carney said on Thursday: “Our banknotes celebrate the UK’s heritage, salute its culture, and testify to the achievements of its most notable iniduals. Turner’s contribution to art extends well beyond his favourite stretch of shoreline.“Turner’s painting was transformative, his influence ned lifetimes, and his legacy endures today. The new £20 note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful, evocative glory.”The note features Turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which hangs in Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognisable works, The Fighting Temeraire – a tribute to the ship which played a big part in Nelson’s victory at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805.The £20 note has a quote from Turner, “light is therefore colour”, and his signature taken from his will, which bequeathed many of his works to the nation.Emin said: “What is really fantastic about Turner being on this note is he was wild and he was a maverick. This note is going to go all over the world and wherever I go I can say: ‘This is where I come from.’ Not just Margate but art. I come from art.”She said if Turner Contemporary had been open when she grew up in Margate her younger years have been transformed.“If this building had been here and I could have come and looked at art and thought I could be part of something my adolescent live would have been very different. I might not have been as successful but it would have been very different.”Turner was selected in 2016 from a longlist of 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public. The list was whittled down to five and Turner was chosen by the Bank’s banknote character advisory committee.The new £20 note will be the first to feature the signature of Sarah John, the Bank’s chief cashier. She said: “The new £20 is an important part of our commitment to providing banknotes that people can use with confidence. With the £20 being our most common this marks a big step forward in our fight against counterfeiting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc02279040c7a17f14f92c9926eb822d93f33a82/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=384df75a92bd206a5e25ac40c360d647","title":"workers exploited at farms supplying uk supermarkets report","story":"Oxfam finds poor pay, 13-hour shifts and high disease risk at farms in India and BrazilPoor pay and punitive working conditions are common on farms and plantations that supply fresh fruit or tea to major UK supermarkets including Lidl, Aldi, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons, according to new research published by a leading international charity.The report from Oxfam claims that the supermarkets’ “relentless” drive to maximise profits is fuelling poverty and gender discrimination in their retail supply chains. Its research is based on in-depth interviews with workers in India and Brazil and a separate survey in five other countries.Interviews with workers on 50 tea plantations in Assam allege that cholera and typhoid are rife because of poor access to toilets and safe drinking water. Half of those questioned receive government ration cards because they earn so little while female workers regularly clocked up 13 hours of hard labour a day.Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury’s confirmed they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited and Lidl was amongst other global supermarkets who source their own brand tea from the Assam region.On fruit farms in north-east Brazil, women with children said they were forced to rely on relatives or government support to feed their families outside the harvest season. Workers reported allergies and serious skin diseases as a result of using chemicals without adequate protection on grape, melon and mango farms that supply supermarkets including Lidl, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and, previously, Morrisons.Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam’s ethical trade manager, said: “Despite some pockets of good practice, supermarkets’ relentless pursuit of profits continues to fuel poverty and human rights abuses in their supply chains. Supermarkets must do more to end exploitation, pay all their workers a living wage, ensure women get a fair deal and be more transparent about where they source their products.”Oxfam also found that supermarkets are taking the lion’s share of the price paid by shoppers. Of the 79p paid by shoppers for a pack of 100g black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers receive just 3p.The research was produced as part of Oxfam’s global Behind the Barcodes campaign, which aims to improve the lives of the millions of people around the world producing food for supermarkets who are trapped in poverty.A separate survey of more than 500 workers on farms in the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Peru and the US found that three-quarters of workers said that they were not paid enough to cover basic needs such as food and housing.On behalf of UK supermarkets, Peter Andrews, the head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue.”A spokesperson for Tesco said: “This is the second year that Tesco has been assessed by Oxfam as doing most, of all major supermarkets globally, to ensure human rights are respected in food supply chains. But we know there is more to do and we are working with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors.”An Aldi spokesperson said: “We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected. We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b34f965ce5df67ba96214089e66f0f9be8434e36/52_8_1391_834/master/1391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e64054e125af8ab665759dc901c1d02","title":"a serious urban mistake why paris went sour on the new gare du nord","story":"As developers aim to turn France’s busiest train station into a gargantuan airport-style mall, Parisians fear for the local neighbourhood – and the station’s soul“When you tell people in Paris you live near the Gare du Nord, they usually grimace,” sighed Sarah, a French academic in her 50s who has lived on a narrow, traffic-choked street next to Europe’s busiest station for 30 years.“Architecturally, the station building is superb. But neighbourhoods around stations are never easy, wherever they are in the world.”Sarah is part of a local residents’ group that has found itself drawn into one of Paris’s biggest development battles in years. The state rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers and is poised to transform the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan €600m (£540m) shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. The French government says the massive glass refit – which will chop up the station into walkways and mezzanine levels via 105 escalators – is the only way to cope with the staggering 900,000 passengers per day who will be using the rail hub by 2030.But top French architects and urban planners, including the award-winning Jean Nouvel, are leading a rebellion. In an open letter they slammed the plans as “unacceptable”, “indecent” and a “serious urban mistake”. Paris city hall, which is merely an observer of the project run by the state, has this month vociferously opposed the private commercial plans to add vast shopping space, pleading for it to scaled back. A planning commission verdict on Thursday will determine whether the plans can go ahead. Meanwhile, Paris is grappling with what the essence of station is and how residents should live around it.“They can argue all they like about what is going to be put inside the station, but if the area around the station isn’t taken into account and altered, with the thundering road traffic eased, the neighbourhood will never improve,” Sarah said.The Gare du Nord is one of the busiest rail hubs in the world, behind only the biggest Japanese stations. When travellers get off the Eurostar from London or the Thalys from Brussels and Amsterdam they are – unusually for an international terminal – stepping right into a frenzy of local, commuter and northern transport which sees the departure of 2,100 trains a day, with 500,000 daily travellers from the Paris banlieue (suburbs) alone.And yet the Gare du Nord occupies a comparatively small site wedged into one of the most built-up and densely populated areas of one of the most tightly-packed capitals in Europe. It sits in what was historically a working-class area with a large hospital right beside it, roads hemming it in and almost no green space in the surrounding streets. With trains already running for four storeys below ground, and traffic choking the chaotic and unusually small forecourt, there is precious little room to expand.For a decade, the 19th-century building, seen as an architectural and engineering masterpiece, has suffered from unflattering comparisons with the calm and gleaming St Pancras in London where Eurostar passengers alight in the UK. Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is mayor of the West Midlands, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord “the squalor pit of Europe” compared with what he called the “modern, forward-looking” St Pancras. But the Gare du Nord’s 700,000 passengers per day dwarfs the footfall of the airier London Eurostar terminal. St Pancras has discreetly tucked its shops beneath lower level arches, while the Gare du Nord has obstructed its main concourse with retail units plonked here and there – at the expense of seating for waiting travellers, who as a consequence are often reduced to sitting on the floor.The French state railway SNCF wants a gleaming new station for the 2024 Paris Olympics, even though many architects believe this deadline is too tight. But the giant scale of the project has led to soul-searching about the city’s future.Paris politicians on the left say private money has been allowed to dictate the project and threatens the very fabric of the station. France’s indebted state railway company now renovates Paris stations in partnership with commercial property giants, who stump up the cash and claw back profits by putting in large numbers of shops. The €600m plans for the Gare du Nord – drawn up with the supermarket giant Auchan – would turn the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. There will be separate spaces for arrivals and departures, which will push travellers up and down a striking number of walkways and escalators to get to and from the tracks while passing the maximum amount of shopping opportunity. Like an airport, there has even been discussion of putting up signs warning people how long it will take to reach their platform.Paris city hall – which is not in charge of the project – has for a year pushed for changes from the sidelines, saying there wasn’t enough space for bikes, not enough thought about rail-users and too much commercial focus, that the project was ridiculously big just to enable a private firm to make money. But suddenly this month, Paris city hall under Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, toughened its stance, arguing the “needless” shopping complex should be scrapped and instead the state should fund a much smaller and simple refit. The government and the state railway insists the full project must go ahead if France’s image is to be upheld for the Olympics.Politicians on the left have warned that the French business model of building vast flagship shopping centres is in decline. Several giant shopping complexes are currently struggling, including one in Aubervilliers on the northern edge of Paris and another near Charles de Gaulle airport. Plans to build a giant shopping and leisure complex north east of Paris called EuropaCity have sparked a huge political row, with business unions warning it will kill small shops in nearby towns. Just one stop away by the RER train from the Gare du Nord, the Forum des Halles at Châtelet is already home to a gargantuan shopping centre which was recently recently rebranded as a Westfield. Restaurants and bars dominate the streets around the Gare du Nord, doing a good trade, and many fear that the new station plans will hurt the neighbourhood economy.The row is so fraught because the Gare du Nord has always had a symbolic place in the social make-up of Paris and the region that surrounds it. It is the gateway to the banlieue and the packed local trains bring professionals to Paris as well as a large proportion of the city’s low-income workers doing crucial service jobs.“I just want to get straight to work and straight home at night and have a seat on the train,” said Maria 52, who lives on an estate north east of Paris and takes crowded trains to several different cleaning jobs each week.In 2001, during the last major renovations, a much-praised glass shed brought some light down into the dingy levels below ground. The architect, Jean-Marie Duthilleul, said: “Instead of looking at their feet, now people can raise their eyes.” But the station is still under pressure to rid itself of the sense it is some kind of border between the rich bustle of Paris and a young population discriminated against and pushed to the outskirts. In 2007, hundreds of youths fought running battles with riot police throwing tear gas inside the station after a man was stopped for fare evasion. The station now has the biggest police presence of any transport hub in France.Alexandra Cordebard, the Socialist mayor of the 10th arrondissement, which is home to the Gare du Nord, lives in an apartment between the Gare du Nord and the nearby, smaller, Gare de L’Est. “Historically, this was the heart of working class Paris, with factory workers and tradespeople with the only remaining large working factory in Paris, the Clairefontaine paper factory,” she said.She said the compact 10th arrondissement, with 100,000 people living in less than three square km of densely packed streets with no public parks, sees its population swell to 1 million people each day as passengers arrive at the two main stations. The patchwork of local apartments and small studios has a broad cultural mix, including students and artists as well as richer residents who have made money on larger properties.Three years ago, France’s first supervised injection facility for drug users opened on a street adjoining the Gare du Nord to allow addicts to inject with clean syringes and under supervision in order to curb overdose deaths and transmission of diseases spread by needle-sharing. Cordebard stressed its opening hours are soon to be extended. The station area has also become a focal point for homelessness. Residents groups insist there must be a post office in the new station as many local services near the station, including the old post office, have closed. Massive traffic jams in front of the station, with motorbikes parked up across pavements, mean it is often a challenge to even cross the road.Cordebard’s key concern is how the area will remain liveable with the climate crisis and rising temperatures. The station and the nearby hospital emit heat amid vast road traffic pollution, and virtually no green space to counter it.“If you look at the thermal map of Paris, the area around the Gare du Nord is the hottest part of the whole city,” she said. “It’s one of the hardest parts of Paris to cool down – we have to limit motorised vehicles and we have to find ways to plant trees.”She added: “For the Gare du Nord to suddenly have this huge extra shopping centre built on top, bringing dozens and dozens of extra lorries a day, bringing extra rubbish each day in a place which can already barely absorb its own daily traffic and activity, I think that’s a problem. It adds to the carbon count, energy consumption and rubbish when we’re already saturated here. Shouldn’t public powers contribute more and build something smaller and better?”In his office at city hall, Paris’s head of urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika said: “A station is about creating a sense of airiness and emptiness, allowing passengers to calmly connect to this monumental public space, it is not about stuffing it full of obstacles for them.” He wanted a return to “the feeling that stations were the big industrial cathedrals of the 19th century” – with the addition, above all, of more space for bikes and connections to public transport.At the Eurostar terminal, Florent, 24, a politics student on his way to visit his sister in London, looked out over bustle. “There’s too much privatisation of public space everywhere else already, stations should be for the passengers,” he said. “But I prefer St Pancras, it seems to have more of a link to history.”And yet the Gare du Nord is dripping in history. The 1864 building, with its striking facade by the German-born architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, was built to expand on a smaller earlier station, and was described in the 1920s by the influential architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock one of the great masterpieces of 19th century architecture.It was built at a time when Napoleon III and his urban planner Georges-Eugène Haussmann were driving grand boulevards through the city’s slums and creating vast prestige projects. Hittorff, who would also be involved with planning the Champs Elysées and placing the Egyptian obelisk in Place de La Concorde, was praised for the technical skill of the Gare du Nord’s vast train-shed roof. His project was so ambitious that its giant metal pillars exceeded French capacity and had to be ordered in from Glasgow. The statues of women representing major and international city destinations on the station’s façade were created by leading artists of the time.“Hittorff is extremely interesting for his level of culture,” said the Paris-based architectural historian Karen Bowie, who signed the recent open letter against the latest renovation plans. “As well as an architect, he was an important archeologist, held to have made the discovery that ancient Greek temples were painted in colour. So there is very careful thought to how he used Greek-inspired ornamentation in the station.”Recent work by scholars in Cologne suggested Hittorff had planned to make more use of colour in the Gare du Nord, Bowie said, in order to “use reflected light to enhance travellers’ experience of the space”.She said it would be “a shame” to put up a series of heavy new walkways that would cut through Hittorff’s vast station space and mask the ornate back elevation. She was concerned that, unlike the current mezzanine for Eurostar passengers – designed to be temporary – the new additions could be hard to reverse.Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the junior transport minister in Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government, insisted that the project was “necessary for the hundreds of thousands of locals and tourists who use the station daily.” He warned that Socialists at city hall were playing politics in the run-up to local elections next March.Claude Solard, of the SNCF railway company, wrote an open letter to detractors in Le Monde saying that the project would see the forecourt pedestrianised, with vast green planting on the roof, and would aim for a zero-waste policy. He said the funding model of private backers meant ticket prices would not go up.Michel Babut of the train-users association FNAUT, said that although there were some positives, such as the Eurostar area of the station being moved to the side and renovated, “this project will spend colossal sums but not improve travellers’ journeys and their experience of the station.”On the station concourse, Patrica, in her 60s, who used to work in a notary’s office in Etaples on the northern French coast, had been travelling regularly to the Gare du Nord for 40 years. “I love the station building, although it does need more toilets,” she said. “But I don’t think it needs more shops. People are so rushed these days, they just want peace and quiet.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae96d3276edf3d61085aec71db74d8a52a60961/0_329_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18805328356518fb28608a76e8df80ca","title":"reading booker prize judge","story":"If I have not quite been myself for the last year, it’s time I explained why. I have spent the past 12 months lost in other people’s imaginations, the breadth and scope of which have been a revelation. This time last year, I became a judge on the 2019 Booker prize, whose winner will be announced on 14 October. I said yes instantly, in delight, knowing I would work out how on earth to fit in so much reading later.Over the past 10 months I have been sleeping less, answering my phone little, not mentally present in queues or on public transport, and roaming instead the mountains of Kashmir, the villages of the Cotswolds, colonial-era Zambia and superhuman communities in Northern Ireland. I have found myself decrypting Shakespearean time travel and complicated sibling love in Lagos.I ended up reading 151 books in six months. The dizziness of this experience was compounded by the extent to which I was travelling in real life. Stephen King once said that books are a uniquely portable form of magic, but – determined to read the old-fashioned way – I found myself lugging a heavy load of them around. Filming in Brazil, Senegal and Jamaica, for example, I checked in extra suitcases full of books, unwilling to put any limits on how many I might get through on each journey. The reality is that we had to read fast – very fast. If I were disciplined, it worked out at a book a day. If I were not, and lavished two or three days on a single novel, sleepless nights would ensue as I desperately raced to catch up.I rarely had time to screen which books I would take with me, resulting in some eery coincidences. On a trip to see the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia, I found myself reading a story about it. It might have been the narrative themes of destiny and ine intervention, or the anti-malaria medication I was taking, but the book gave me a strange and unshakable chill.On the Eurostar to Paris during the Easter holidays, I was so absorbed that I had stopped concentrating on the two overexcited children in my care – by now giggling too loudly at an iPad movie – prompting a French person in the seat opposite to say, “I don’t know what you people do at home, but this is the Eurostar.” The book I was reading had unpleasant notes of racism, too, with its pointed stereotype of a murderous African viewed through the gaze of a white man.I have tended so much towards non-fiction in my adult life, because of the journalism and writing I do, but reading for the Booker was a study in the power of fiction to shape our social and political discourse. Haruki Murakami once said that if you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. What I found is that if you only read the kind of novel you have always read, you can only think the kind of things you usually think.The greatest insights I experienced during this period came from books I would never have chosen. I found new things to love in the most unexpected places: an English schoolboy who didn’t fit in a couple of Irish gangsters scouring a Spanish port a Vietnamese mother and son making sense of life in the US the minute details of the life of a Swiss orphan who went on to become Madame Tussaud.I realised that, like so many of us, I filter my book choices to reflect the world I already know. Reading stories that I would never have chosen, mistakenly believing them to be uninteresting or too remote from my concerns, reading them intensely, fast, sacrificing social and family commitments to make sure I gave them the time that they deserved: this slowly began to change me.It wasn’t all easy. This process also turned out to be an exercise in overcoming my own deep sense of impostor syndrome – a belief that I was not qualified, literary or clever enough to be a judge on this prestigious prize. I found myself sneaking reading time in the corner of gaudy, harshly lit TV studios, when I imagined my fellow judges in beautiful, book-lined rooms, seated by a large window in quiet contemplation. At times, I thought about pulling out.I was wrong, though. My fellow judges were the best thing about reading the Booker list – having to get through this much, this fast, is a good recipe not just for sleep deprivation, but also friendship. Now I totally get book clubs. I wouldn’t realistically advocate trying to read 151 books back to back, but if you would like to try our longlist of 13, you too can totally join this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0450b4cfd7dada3fa993fa211e804950f709e5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a876a6493610937bdc5f8a5899df795f","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.Those identified range from investor-owned firms – household names such as Chevron, Exxon, BP and Shell – to state-owned companies including Saudi Aramco and Gazprom.Michael Mann, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, said the findings shone a light on the role of fossil fuel companies and called on politicians at the forthcoming climate talks in Chile in December to take urgent measures to rein in their activities.“The great tragedy of the climate crisis is that seven and a half billion people must pay the price – in the form of a degraded planet – so that a couple of dozen polluting interests can continue to make record profits. It is a great moral failing of our political system that we have allowed this to happen.”The global polluters list uses company-reported annual production of oil, natural gas, and coal and then calculates how much of the carbon and methane in the produced fuels is emitted to the atmosphere throughout the supply chain, from extraction to end use. approached the 20 companies named in the polluters list. Eight of them have replied. Some argued that they were not directly responsible for how the oil, gas or coal they extracted were used by consumers. Several disputed claims that the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known as far back as the late 1950s or that the industry collectively had worked to delay action.Most explicitly said they accepted the climate science and some claimed to support the targets set out in the Paris agreement to reduce emissions and keep global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.All pointed out efforts they were making to invest in renewable or low carbon energy sources and said fossil fuel companies had an important role to play in addressing the climate crisis. PetroChina said it was a separate company from its predecessor, China National Petroleum, so had no influence over, or responsibility for, its historical emissions. The companies’ replies can be read in full here.The latest study builds on previous work by Heede and his team that has looked at the historical role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis.Heede said: “These companies and their products are substantially responsible for the climate emergency, have collectively delayed national and global action for decades, and can no longer hide behind the smokescreen that consumers are the responsible parties.“Oil, gas, and coal executives derail progress and offer platitudes when their vast capital, technical expertise, and moral obligation should enable rather than thwart the shift to a low-carbon future.”Heede said 1965 was chosen as the start point for this new data because recent research had revealed that by that stage the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known by industry leaders and politicians, particularly in the US.Heede added: “Leading companies and industry associations were aware of, or wilfully ignored, the threat of climate change from continued use of their products since the late 1950s.”The research aims to hold to account those companies most responsible for carbon emissions, and shift public and political debate away from a focus just on inidual responsibility. It follows a warning from the UN in 2018 that the world has just 12 years to avoid the worst consequences of runaway global heating and restrict temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.The study shows that many of the worst offenders are investor-owned companies that are household names around the world and spend billions of pounds on lobbying governments and portraying themselves as environmentally responsible.A study earlier this year found that the largest five stock-market-listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.Heede said the companies had a “significant moral, financial, and legal responsibility for the climate crisis, and a commensurate burden to help address the problem”.He added: “Even though global consumers from iniduals to corporations are the ultimate emitters of carbon dioxide, the Climate Accountability Institute focuses its work on the fossil fuel companies that, in our view, have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to non-carbon fuels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5d9af6ec191750464e10300ae51034cdf0dc61/0_144_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bcf98c964c10c7c7da0fe3091bafb22","title":"exclusive carmakers opponents climate action us europe emissions","story":"Lobbying in US and Europe has tried to block and delay moves to cut emissions, study showsGlobal carmakers are among the leading opponents of action on the climate crisis, according to exclusive analysis of the way major corporations frustrate or undermine initiatives to cut greenhouse gases.The research for the  reveals that while the automotive industry releases public statements that support climate initiatives, such as increased electrification, it has been pouring millions of dollars through industry bodies into lobbying efforts to challenge attempts to tackle global heating in the past four years.This is despite repeated warnings that the planet is in the grip of a global climate emergency.The study was undertaken by InfluenceMap, an independent research group, as part of the polluters project.The evidence was gathered by assessing each company’s size and lobbying activities.

Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.InfluenceMap used a definition of what constitutes lobbying drawn from the UN-backed Guide For Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy.The research revealed that since 2015, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, Daimler, BMW, Toyota and General Motors have been among the strongest opponents of regulations to help countries meet the 1.5C warming limit in the Paris agreement.Edward Collins, author of The Carbon Policy Footprint, said: “Corporations have a profound impact on the climate change agenda not only through physical emissions but through influencing of the climate change policy agendas being introduced by governments around the world.“The sector has dug in hard to dampen rising vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards. Through their lobbying, auto companies have delayed the transition of a sector that sucks up a huge proportion of oil demand globally.” contacted all the named car companies and their responses are set out here. Most said they were committed to reducing emissions and moving their fleets to lower-emission models but the transition had to take into account other factors including market realities, customer preference, and infrastructure development.Ford denied it was pushing for a rollback of emissions standards in the US. It pointed to its recent agreement with California to increase gas mileage standards and reduce emissions.InfluenceMap identified 33 corporations as the strongest opponents of action to reduce climate change. Six of them were car companies, and the rest primarily oil and gas companies as well as energy firms. The lobbying efforts are revealed as countries increasingly set targets to phase out new sales of cars with internal combustion engines – the Netherlands and Norway by 2025, Germany, India and China by 2030, and France and the UK by 2040.The influence exerted by the car companies is fronted and aided by industry groups including the US-based Automotive Alliance, as well as Europe’s ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association) and the VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry). These groups all have senior figures from the big car companies on their boards of directors.Fiat Chrysler was ranked most oppositional to climate change regulations and initiatives, Collins said. The company is a “key player” in the industry’s efforts to weaken US clean car standards, known as CAFE standards, set by Barack Obama, which would almost double the fuel economy of vehicles to an average of 54 miles per gallon by 2025.Fiat Chrysler has supported a review of the CAFE standards being considered by the president, Donald Trump. Its late CEO, Sergio Marchionne, said last year he was “fully supportive” of the administration’s efforts to revise the standards.General Motors and Ford have also been key lobbyists through the industry group pushing back against the CAFE standards, while putting out the message in public that they are signed up to the transport transformation required, the report says. The report acknowledges that Ford recently softened its stance and agreed a compromise in California, but that change of position – after a significant stretch of oppositional lobbying – only marginally impacted on its ranking, which involved analysis since the Paris agreement in 2015.The California agreement, Collins said, still constituted “a diluted set of standards”.A spokesperson for Ford said: “We have said multiple times that Ford does not support a rollback of federal emission standards. Additionally, Ford supports CO2 reductions consistent with the Paris climate accord, as we have shared publicly.”In Europe, the car industry, through the ACEA and the VDA, has continually pushed against new CO2 emissions standards for new vehicles by 2021, and from 2021 to 2030, under the EU clean mobility package.Average emissions of cars produced by manufacturers must be 95gkm by 2021, with penalties of €95 per gkm, per car, for companies not meeting those targets.Car industry lobbying in Europe through ACEA successfully shelved a proposed EU mandate on sales of electric cars by 2025 similar to those that operate in California and China.Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director for the Transport \u0026amp Environment NGO, said the automotive industry was seeking to eke out the last profits of the traditional engine by frustrating emissions reduction targets and questioning every aspect of electric technology, from expressing apparent concerns about the affordability for consumers to querying if the infrastructure will be in place in time.“The car industry has always maximised its profits from its existing models and products for as long as is possible to make their money and delay and work around the regulations,” she said.“They have known for years – since 2013 – the standards coming in on emissions in 2021. They have had years to prepare but they didn’t. Instead they pushed their SUV market, maximised its sales reach to make profits from these high-polluting, high-margin vehicles for as long as possible and now they are scrambling to comply, claiming how difficult it is to meet the targets, but they only have themselves to blame.”Unilever is ranked the most influential positive company, while Apple and Amazon are also deemed to be among the top positive corporate influencers.Collins said the majority of the world’s most influential companies remained on the fence about the policies needed to address the climate crisis.While making PR-friendly comments on climate they do not engage in any way with the regulations being introduced by global governments to meet the Paris agreement, the report says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/773d7ff10ddfee0cbb57a008621462ae19bb8737/0_0_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5797008dec2e79be07577c1225aefc7a","title":"oil firms barrels markets","story":"Projected production surge in next 12 years to be led by Shell despite climate crisisby  Jonathan Watts,  Jillian Ambrose and  Adam VaughanThe world’s 50 biggest oil companies are poised to flood markets with an additional 7m barrels per day over the next decade, despite warnings from scientists that this will push global heating towards catastrophic levels.The projections by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy regarded as the gold standard for data in the industry, highlight how major players seem to be ignoring government promises, scientific alarms and a growing public outcry so they can pump more fossil fuels – and profits – out of the ground. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965.

Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.Rystad bases its work on companies’ assets and a long-term oil price of $65 a barrel, similar to its current level.At least 14 of the 20 biggest historical carbon producers plan to pump out more hydrocarbons in 2030 than in 2018, according to the Rystad data.Its analysis shows the US is the centre of the latest global oil boom, with more than four times more new production than the next country, Canada, over the next 10 years.The expansion will primarily be in the Permian basin in Texas. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips will be involved, as well as smaller, faster-growing private firms that are together driving this single US state to produce more oil and gas than all of Saudi Arabia by 2030.Massive new drilling projects are also under way or planned in north-west Argentina, off the Caribbean shores of Guyana, in Kazakhstan’s Kashagan oilfield, in the Yamal peninsula in Siberia and in the Barents Sea.Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International, which monitors oil companies, said: “Rather than planning an orderly decline in production, they are doubling down and acting like there is no climate crisis. This presents us with a simple choice: shut them down or face extreme climate disruption.” Richard Heede, a researcher at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, said the companies would be putting themselves – and human civilisation – at risk, unless they shifted to renewable energy and offset new production to net zero by mid-century.“No company that values its social licence to operate shall make a capital investment in new fossil fuel projects without offsetting or sequestering an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide so as to assure alignment with science-based targets to 1.5C and net zero emissions by 2050,” he added.Separately, the watchdog group Global Witness estimates companies plan to invest $4.9tn in new fields – none of which are compatible with the 1.5C target.Dieter Helm, an Oxford University academic and government adviser, said oil giants were planning a final fossil fuel “harvest”.“If we were serious about addressing climate change we would leave some oil in the ground, so there is a scramble among big oil companies to make sure their assets are not the ones left stranded,” he said. “Their answer is to pump as much as they can, while they still can, to keep delivering shareholder idends. But the problem for the rest of us is that they are going to produce far more oil and gas than is consistent with the Paris agreement.”The company’s forecast trajectory shows it will overtake today’s biggest international oil company, ExxonMobil, by 2025, according to Rystad. Shell said it did not disclose future production plans but it was on course to sustain output to meet demand, which required continued investment.The company has been lauded for its environmental leadership among its big oil peers, owing to its vocal support of the Paris climate agreement, carbon intensity targets – mainly through more emphasis on gas than oil – and forays into low-carbon projects.Ben van Beurden, the chief executive, has called climate change the biggest issue facing the oil industry. The company plans to expand into renewables but just $1bn-$2bn of its annual $25bn-$30bn capital expenditure is allocated for low-carbon projects, a figure it hopes to double.“We believe … it is our role to make sure we make energy available with a lower carbon footprint, so that we help whether it is the aviation sector, the residential sector, the steel sector or the petrochemical sector to curtail and contain their greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.“I believe philosophically – and I know this is a tough sell because there is a fringe that is in a different camp on this – that it is not for energy companies to curtail the use of energy.”Espen Erlingsen, an analyst at Rystad, said: “Among the majors, we see the largest growth potential coming from Shell. Here deepwater, shale gas and tight oil projects are driving the potential production growth.” But he said Shell had sold some of its most carbon-intensive assets, such as Canadian tar sands fields.None of the top 20 companies disputed the projections.An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “We believe climate change is a serious issue and it is going to take efforts by business, governments and consumers to make meaningful action. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions.”Other companies said they were investing in renewables or focusing on gas. Total said it was increasing the efficiency of its facilities but was not responsible for how its products were used by consumers. More details about their responses can be found here.In absolute terms, the international oil companies will still be dwarfed by the output of state-run national firms in the future. The biggest, Saudi Aramco, will continue to suck the most fossil fuels out of the ground.Between 2018 and 2030, it plans to produce oil and gas equivalent to 27bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide – almost all of which will eventually make its way into the atmosphere and add to the problem of global heating. This is followed by Gazprom, the Iranian National Oil Co, ExxonMobil, Russia’s Rosneft, Shell, PetroChina and BP.Some of the few projected declines are in Algeria, Mexico and Venezuela, though forecasts for the state-owned corporations in these countries are considered less reliable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941fd18e188c61c3b26f841f138ebaecf2cc9cf5/0_325_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ebd47920994a66d7cd59bc4f96b39f","title":"shrinking glaciers mont blanc from the air 100 years on","story":"A century after Walter Mittelholzer’s famous aerial mission, scientists repeat his journey to shed light on the impact of global heating In 1919, the Swiss pilot and photographer Walter Mittelholzer flew over Mont Blanc in a biplane photographing the alpine landscape. A century on, scientists have recreated his images to show the impact of global heating on the mountain’s glaciers.Dr Kieran Baxter and Dr Alice Watterson from the University of Dundee used a process called monoplotting to work out the precise locations from which Mittelholzer had taken his photographs. They returned to the spot in a helicopter and lined up their cameras using the alpine peaks as their guide. The scientists captured images of three glaciers that Mittelholzer had also photographed: the Bossons glacier, the Argentière glacier and the Mer de Glace, all on the northern side of the Mont Blanc massif.The resulting photographs show just how much ice has been lost from the region over the past century.Baxter said: “The scale of the ice loss was immediately evident as we reached altitude but it was only by comparing the images side-by-side that the last 100 years of change were made visible.“It was both a breathtaking and heartbreaking experience, particularly knowing that the melt has accelerated massively in the last few decades.”The Mer de Glace, the longest glacier in France, is the site of the biggest changes over past decades. In the 1800s, travel writers described how it could be seen from the resort town of Chamonix, but it has since receded more than 2km up the mountain’s slopes.The Mer de Glace “is now melting at the rate of around 40 metres a year and has lost 80 metres in depth over the last 20 years alone,” the glaciologist Luc Moreau told the  last year.Mittelholzer, who trained as a military pilot during the first world war, later became the director of a commercial aviation company that later became the Swiss national carrier, Swissair. He died in a climbing accident in 1937.Baxter said: “Mittelholzer played a key role in popularising commercial air travel in Switzerland, an industry which ironically came to contribute to the warming of the climate – and the detriment of the alpine landscapes.”The Dundee scientists said they were careful to keep their own impact on the environment to a minimum.“When working at these heights there is currently no viable emission-free alternative so airtime is kept as brief as possible and careful planning goes into getting the most out of a photography flight like this one,” said Baxter.“Luckily, clear weather allowed these repeat aerial photographs to be taken on the centenary year of the originals. Unless we drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, there will be little ice left to photograph in another hundred years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33df5828ee1c0e55b3496008a72f7a863ab6fd6d/0_20_2920_3964/master/2920.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b716411e4896be00ee66cca01caf622 1010w","title":"chiwetel ejiofor webchat questions lion king maleficent","story":"The 12 Years a Slave star answered questions on everything from being asked to change his name to why he’d love to work in Nollywood and who inspired him to become a directorThank you so much for such insightful questions!How has your point of view changed on the communities that you’ve represented in film, for example, LGBT communities after starring in Kinky Boots?Thank you. in some ways I think that Kinky Boots was a film ahead of its time and I’m really proud of it. It’s been fantastic to see more representation of different communities especially the LGBT community in film and television. I still feel more can be done and the film industry especially has further to go in terms of representation and inclusion - but it has certainly improved.Who or what inspired you to become an actor?William Shakespeare inspired me to become an actor.Studying Henry IV Part 1 in my early teens was when I first felt deeply inspired by literature. I went around school saying I\u0027d discovered this great playwright and poet and was informed I was not the first to get there.What are your memories of living in Forest Gate and do you feel like it’s changed a lot, particularly in the last five years?I have an enduring memory of hearing the West Ham roar when I was growing up in Forest Gate - which I loved, even though I ultimately moved south and became a Palace fan. I haven’t been back in the last five years but I presume from your question it may have changed significantly. London does tend to change quickly.Half of a Yellow Sun was halfway there, but would you ever work in Nollywood?I would love to.Which other actors inspire you? Which actors andor directors would you like to work with?So many directors that I want to work with. But I have to say I always loved the films of Lynne Ramsay. I was watching You Were Never Really Here again the other day and you really sense the painstaking detail and emotional truth that she’s able to mine in every moment.What were your favourite films when growing up as a childteenager? The ones that you can still say are your all-time favourites?I just remember seeing Bicycle Thieves when I was young and being so struck by it. And watching it again as an adult and realising that I was just as moved and engaged, years later. And still am - it remains one of my favourite films ever.Have you ever been pressured or advised to change your name? Given the protest over English actors being cast in Welsh roles, and non-Jewish actors being cast in Jewish roles, to the exclusion of actors of those ethnicities, have you personally been affected by the controversy over British actors being cast as historical figures from black American history, especially since you portrayed Solomon Northup?Thank you - great question. Yeah when I was younger some people did advise me to change my name but obviously I decided against it which I’m glad of. I think when any group of people are concerned about their representation it’s really important to listen and take it very seriously, which I do. In this industry it’s a growing and increasingly complex question about representation. The aim is to hopefully find mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships. I’d never want to shoot the arrow over the house and hurt my brother.Congrats on making the transition into writing and directing. I love your adaptation of The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind as well as your short film Columbite Tantalite and I’m eager to see what’s next. What are the last 3 books you enjoyed reading?Thank you! I’m delighted that you enjoyed the films. Books that I enjoyed? Robopocalypse - it’s a great piece of sci-fi. Physics and Dance by Emily Coates and Sarah Demers - that was cool and interesting. And I always enjoy dipping into a book called The Human Past by Chris Scarre - a great archeological book.You have a fantastic name - does it have a particular meaning? Also, any plans to return to the stage?Chiwetel means “God brings” in Igbo. And I’m always planning to return to the stage.1. how tough was your training for Red Belt? You had some very tough guys with years of fighting experience working with you. Do you still train Brazilian jiujitsu? If so which black belt?2. enjoyed your directorial debut – do you plan to continue directing?It was tough training for Red Belt even though it was enjoyable as well. I trained with some tough guys in LA who were really supportive and it made the process really engaging. I don’t still train Brazilian Jiujitsu but it would probably come back to me if I were attacked in the correct sequence of moves. I’m glad you enjoyed The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind and I’m very excited about directing more.How was it playing Okwe in Dirty Pretty Things? It’s still, to my mind, a stunning piece of work that hasn’t dated.It was very emotional and involving for me playing Okwe in Dirty Pretty Things and I agree it’s just as relevant now as it was nearly 20 years ago. Which is sad to think about really. But it was an incredible experience and working with Stephen Frears was the time when I think I really started to fall in love with making films and the poetry of the film-making process.How was it reuniting with your old Salt co-star Angelina Jolie on Maleficent? Did the film make you re-evaluate the fairytales you’d read as a child – and did you feel a sense of responsibility about how much movies influence young people?Plus, I’ve got to ask ... Andrew Lincoln and Keira Knightley, in Love Actually. You must have known something was going on, surely? It was obvious to the rest of us looking on.It was great to work with Angelina again. I loved working with her on Salt and she’s so deeply invested in everything she works on and has such a great world view that her films really reflect. So it’s always fun to go into that world. I came to the first film quite late but I loved it because it re-evaluated the fairy tales and the character tropes that I grew up with. And I think that can be really influential on a younger generation. Re Love, Actually - Peter was obviously blinded by love! Both of them!What was Joss Whedon like to work with? #serenityJoss was just amazing to work with and it was wonderful at the time to join the cast of Serenity Firefly. He had an encyclopedic understanding of film and TV and was just deeply inspirational.In which ways do you think the British movietheatre sector will be affected by Brexit?I think one the great things about the British film industry at the moment is how many people are able to be here from Europe - and work here. And because there\u0027s so much happening it\u0027s utilised a lot of different technicians. The important thing is to absolutely maintain that and keep Britain as a place people are excited to be in and able to work in.As an in-demand working actor, how do you keep your instruments (voice, body etc) in tune while following such a busy schedule?It\u0027s actually very important to remember to look after yourself while doing so much. Drama school was really great for learning techniques to help with maintaining voice work and I like that question because it\u0027s a very good reminder to keep thinking about that.You and Benedict Wong have fantastic onscreen chemistry (Dirty Pretty Things, The Martian). Would you consider making more movies together perhaps a show about two London cops?I would love to continue to work with Benedict Wong - he is a brilliant actor and a great guy. A show about two London cops would be fun! You should follow him on Instagram.Chiwetel Ejiofor is with us nowOne of the UK’s finest screen and stage performers, Chiwetel Ejiofor has “talent to take your breath away” – according to the Observer’s Amy Raphael, that is. Since his breakthrough role in the Stephen Frears-directed drama Dirty Pretty Things in 2002, Ejiofor has become a fixture in British cinema and Hollywood, with appearances in Love Actually, Kinky Boots, Children of Men, American Gangster and The Martian.Arguably his career high point (so far) was his Oscar-nominated performance as Solomon Northup in Steve McQueen’s drama 12 Years a Slave. Ejiofor has also dipped a toe in directorial waters with the Malawi-set The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, about a villager who invents a wind turbine. And that’s not even counting his stage work, which includes an acclaimed Othello at the Donmar Warehouse in 2007 and Everyman at the National Theatre in 2015.This year is a Disney one-two: we have already seen the release of The Lion King, for which Ejiofor voiced the rascally Scar in the CGI “live action” remake, and just about to arrive is Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in which he plays a wise clan chieftain who counsels Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent.He’ll be with us for a webchat on Thursday 10 October at 1.20pm BST so send us your questions now, and we’ll get as many answered as time allows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a507d954e5e9b6fe17d51286de126ae08d6668/0_86_3239_1944/master/3239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92caa1e510cf0e15831c840806309160","title":"flour power meet the bread heads baking a better loaf","story":"Mechanised food factories demand ingredients that are standard, stable and easy to transport, and make products that are standard, stable and easy to transport. New wheats have been bred (and, in the US, genetically modified) for high yields and high protein content that require inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. To increase efficiency, hedgerows and copses have been eliminated and farmland agglomerated into increasingly larger tracts of monoculture.From soil to plastic-packaged loaf, industrialised breads are the end product of 100 years of innovation in agriculture, manufacturing and transport, all of which prioritises efficiency and cost over nutrition and taste. Bread is the most-bought food item in the UK, but the supermarket loaf is just part of a basket of highly processed foods that we are now beginning to understand is making us fat, sick and allergic.While the big bakeries may market brown loaves under homely monikers such as farmhouse, wholegrain and multiseed, these are often distinctions without much meaning. The basic ingredient of highly processed flour is the same, even if bran or other sources of fibre are added back into the mix. More research is needed, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that gluten intolerance (not to be confused with coeliac disease, which means people cannot process gluten at all) could be caused by the extra gluten that is often added to mass-produced wholewheat products, and that the old-fashioned longer proving time – the resting time that allows yeasts to ferment the dough and make it rise – is a key factor in rendering wholegrains more digestible.Good bread needs no more than four ingredients: flour, yeast, water and salt. Wheats were once regional and adapted to the land grain was milled locally and often baked as wholegrain flour into dense loaves. In Britain and the US, most of us have not eaten this kind of bread in so many generations there is no longer even a folk memory of what it tasted like. The desire for lighter and whiter bread is steeped in history: finer, paler, sifted flour was more expensive and the province of the rich, and as such has been a enduring trend, even as flour became a bland and cheap commodity, often bleached to make it even whiter.But in the past couple of decades, new movements have begun to challenge the prevailing food culture. In the early 2000s, activist and journalist Michael Pollan wrote about how what we eat had lost its link with the land and the farmer. Leading the revolt against processed food, in 2010, Pollan came up with the line that became a catchphrase: “Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food.” Dan Barber, a chef on a mission to bring back the links between sustainable farming and taste and nutrition, delivered a Ted Talk in 2008 in which he described modern industrial agriculture as “an insult to the basic laws of nature”. He and others have popularised the farm-to-table movement that is changing people’s eating habits, encouraging farmers to grow varieties for deliciousness over yield, efficiency of transport and shelf life.In 2011, the geneticist Steve Jones founded the Bread Lab in Oregon, bringing farmers, millers, brewers and bakers together to develop new grains that emphasised taste. In 2014, Jones suggested the supermarket loaf should be called “American” or “processed bread”, to distinguish its mass-produced identity and nutritional characteristics. He told me he does not like to be in the same room as white flour. Meanwhile, a sourdough movement bubbled up in San Francisco, championing the resurgence of the traditional method of leavening bread using natural starters that harness a complex web of ambient bacteria and fungi, rather than strong modern yeasts bred to inject air into almost anything.The great food writer Julia Child once said British white bread tasted “like Kleenex”. Maybe that is why we load our white sliced toast with so much jam and chocolate spread and peanut butter. Wholegrain, sourdough bread is a very different beast crunchy, crusty, chewy, with a complex taste that is rich, nutty and tangy. Quite often, I find a couple of thick slices, spread with a generous swathe of butter, a satisfying lunch.The revival of ancient varieties of wheat is inspiring a new movement of agronomists, farmers, millers and bakers in the UK. They are coming together to develop and grow new kinds of wheat that do not need dousing with chemicals, to mill the grain in such a way as to keep taste and nutrition intact, and to bake loaves that are delicious and healthy. In the process, these artisans want to challenge the dominance of chemical agriculture and the supermarket loaf, to establish a new kind of supply chain that links our diet to nature and creates healthy communities.Bread is a basic foodstuff. It is our land and our kitchen table, family tradition and religious celebration. Our daily bread is our daily life it is economics – breadwinner, breadbaskets, breadlines it is politics – upper crust, bread and circuses, grist for the mill. As this group of growers, millers and bakers are demonstrating, bread can be revolution, too.In the 1960s, while we were falling for the abundance of postwar produce and the convenience of the supermarket, one British plant pathologist was battling with mould. As a young researcher in East Anglia, Martin Wolfe specialised in barley mildew. At the time, the prevailing view was that science could improve on nature’s design agronomy focused on breeding grains that would produce the highest yields, and developing fertilisers and pesticides to encourage and protect them.Wolfe began to see that as soon as a new variety of barley was introduced, pathogens adapted to find a way to attack it as soon as a new fungicide was formulated, the pathogen reacted by developing resistance to it. He realised that nature was always going to win the race.He was single-minded, driven, almost obsessive his family complained that he was difficult to call away from his desk for dinner. He understood earlier than most that adding more chemicals was not a sustainable answer, and looked for different ways to grow healthy crops. He experimented with breeding varieties carrying different resistance genes. When he planted out his new varieties and mixtures, he found that infection levels fell.In the 70s, Wolfe worked with East German scientists who wanted to reduce their use of expensive foreign pesticides. By the end of the 80s, almost all their spring barley (an important crop, because the East exported malted barley to the West German brewing industry for hard currency) was being grown according to Wolfe’s techniques. But when the Berlin Wall came down, they were encouraged, like other farmers in western Europe, via subsidies and promises of high yields, to use chemical fertilisers.“I’ve always felt like a bit of an outsider,” Wolfe admitted in an interview. He was a scientist, and at first sceptical of the organic movement that emerged in the 80s, which he felt was turning back the clock. His priority was breeding new crops to tackle the environmental challenges of the future. Over the decades, Wolfe became convinced that ersity – the very thing that modern agriculture was eliminating with its herbicides and monoculture – was the key to resistance. When a pathogen attacked a genetically homogenous crop, it could wipe out a whole field.As he approached retirement, Wolfe wanted to put some of the new ideas about mixed farming practices into use. Agroforestry had begun to gain ground in the 70s when Phil Rutter, an American plant breeder, asked a big question: if nature’s dominant agriculture was trees – perennials – why had man spent 10,000 years developing annual crops? Rutter was convinced that trees such as hazel and chestnut could provide as much nutrition as cereals without having to be resown every year. His motto was: “The future of the world is nuts.”In 1994, Wolfe bought two meadows and a low-ceilinged long house in Suffolk called Wakelyns, which had a been a pig farm, then a dog-breeding site. Wolfe drew up elaborate plans for avenues of hazel, willow and a mixture of fruit, nut and timber trees. In the lanes in between the trees, he would grow annual crops: vegetables, cereals, legumes. Wakelyns was always imagined as an experimental agroforestry farm, “a rather expensive personal hobby”, as his son, David, put it, not a going concern. It soon became a centre for real research.At first, the saplings, planted in mud with protective plastic rabbit-proof sleeves, looked thin, vulnerable and unimpressive. Visiting farmers shook their heads, wondering why land was being wasted by planting trees on it. “No experiment ever fails,” Wolfe liked to say. As the trees grew and projects proceeded, visitors were drawn to Wakelyns to see for themselves one of the best examples of agroforestry in Europe. Wolfe walked them through his lanes of crops, his white hair glowing like a nimbus, backlit by the sun, explaining the how the trees, with their long roots, were able to draw nutrients from deep in the soil, which the annual crops also benefited from, via fungal networks in the soil. “There is an idea that crops suffer from competition with trees,” he told one interviewer, “but it is not true – they are sheltered and protected by trees.”In 2000, Wolfe created a very special crop. With the help of plant breeders and the scientists from the Organic Research Centre, Wolfe took 20 varieties of wheat that had been doing well under low-input conditions in the UK, half chosen for their quality – their high protein and gluten contents – half for their high yield, and cross-bred them every which way, resulting in 190 new crosses. Normally, a breeder would look at these plants and select for the traits they wanted. But this time seeds from all 190 were thrown together in a field, grown, harvested and reseeded together for several years. Wolfe called it YQ, for “yield” and “quality”.Whereas selection ordinarily narrowed the genetic pool, as with inbreeding dogs, this method maintained it. The genetic ersity in this crop meant the wheat was not only resistant to pathogens, but also tolerant of varying growing conditions. The yield of YQ was never going to match that of high-yield wheat in a good year, but over time, Wolfe showed, its yields through wet or dry or pestilential years, when whole fields of homogenous wheat could be wiped out, were compellingly consistent.Wolfe milled his YQ grain into flour in a small electric stone mill in his barn. His wife, Ann, made cakes and pastry with it, and everyone loved its rich, nutty taste. But Wolfe had not yet found a baker who would turn it into bread.Last February, I drove north to meet one of the foremost of a new generation of British artisanal bakers – Kim Bell, who started The Small Food Bakery in Nottingham five years ago and, in 2018, won a prestigious BBC Food and Farming award. I found Bell cleaning up at the end of the day. Hale, with floury hands, and her hair tied up in a cloth bandana, she gave me a bottle of house-made rhubarb kefir as she finished vacuuming the ovens. She is a proper baker – a mix of passion and exhaustion. When she finally sat down, I said: “One day you’ll have someone else to do the washing up!” Bell shook her head. “We don’t have anyone who comes in to do menial work. We all do it ourselves.” This, she explained, was deliberate, part of a policy to encourage autonomy and responsibility. She wanted each baker to be mindful of resources: energy, time and hot water.I ate one of her cinnamon buns: sticky, soft and crunchy all at once sweet from the chestnut honey and sour from the tang of the naturally fermented dough. Every mouthful was differently delicious.Bell had gone to art school but didn’t want to be an artist. For many years, she worked with her father in a contracting business, specialising in installing coffee shops and minimarkets in petrol stations. They were successful, but she found the world of mass-market retail depressing and wasteful. Bell is the kind of person who always has a dozen projects on the go and a large cast of collaborators. She was often cooking on the side, filling in at a friend’s pub, catering a wedding or baking for the Women’s Institute market. At one point, she got involved with helping a friend open a cafe.She also started reading Michael Pollan and Dan Barber, and discovered the US food movement linking sustainable agriculture and deliciousness. She went to listen to a talk by Andrew Whitley, the godfather of the British sourdough movement, who had opened the first organic bakery in the UK – the Village Bakery in Melmerby in Cumbria – in 1976. “Andrew was selling the idea of a bread revolution where we use wild yeasts and we know where our grain comes from.”Bell is a very good baker she is also a political baker. Learning about soil depletion and disease and social justice, she was appalled, and then galvanised. “It just all came together for me: there is a problem in our food system and we need to fix it.”Thoughts converged, and events conspired: a small kitchen-cafe came up for hire in an artists’ co-op in Nottingham, and in 2014, Bell found herself with a space and an oven. Opening a bakery seemed an obvious way to challenge all that she felt was wrong with the industrial food system, a sourdough gauntlet to throw down in opposition to the supermarket loaf in its plastic sleeve.“I flung my doors open one day with absolutely no fanfare,” Bell remembered. “I didn’t announce it. There was no sign. I had one customer the whole day. And she was gluten intolerant.” Bell had no formal baking training she did what most new artisan bakers do: she tried to copy the Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, with its much-lauded and Instagram-famous crumb (bread’s interior texture) full of big holes, and its sharply crunchy crusts.“You think flour is a stable ingredient,” Bell explained to me as she opened a few bags of different flours for me to feel and taste. “But if it’s done right, it’s living and alive.” I held some flour in my palm and saw how it clumped a little when I compressed it – the measure of its moisture. The flour I had unthinkingly always used is really only an inert powder of indefinable shelf life, whereas this kind of whole grain, containing the oils of the germ, lasts a few months before it can go rancid. Bell is one of the vanguard of bakers in the UK trying to make better flour and tastier, more satisfying loaves. Part of the taste comes from using different grains – the ancient progenitors of modern wheats, like spelt, einkorn and emmer, or cereals such as rye, buckwheat, barley and oats – and part from the lactic tang of the “starter”, the natural leavening ferment made from a flour-and-water paste and ambient yeasts.When Bell first started the bakery she used organic flour from Shipton Mill, a British miller that provides high-quality blends of flour. But she wanted to understand more about the products she was using, where they came from, how they were grown she wanted, as part of the mission and identity of the bakery, to source ingredients locally. She soon found someone who was milling organic flour in a windmill only 40 miles away.After working for years in the corporate world, Paul Wyman and his wife, Fari, bought the refurbished windmill at Tuxford 14 years ago, pretty much on a whim. The learning curve was steep. Wyman had to figure out the hard way the difference between “milling wheat” and “feed wheat” fit for animals (it has a different protein content a lot of bakers are used to working with higher protein contents because it creates a more open, structured crumb), and there were plenty of mechanical problems and sudden wind gusts, but, he admitted, “slowly, I became a pretty good miller”.His wife presides in the tea room, selling cakes and scones made with flour he has milled, to showcase how different the taste can be. (I bought two bags of his Tuxford Gold and made everything from pasta to pastry with them the difference in quality was clear – it was richer, more complicated, more interesting.)There is something quite extraordinary about the sheer physicality of a working windmill. The big canvas sails turned as gracefully and powerful as a tall masted ship. Inside the shafts and chains and pulleys and wooden toothed gears clanked and thumped as the iron spindle revolved, running through the centre of the two heavy grinding stones. People have been grinding grain into flour in this way for thousands of years.Jones convenes an annual symposium, the Grain Gathering in Oregon, which brings together bakers, breeders and millers from all over the world. Jones is a global leader developing new wheats and other cereals tailored to the varied needs of bakers, brewers, farmers and consumers. Recently, the Bread Lab launched a new sliced loaf developed to appeal to consumers brought up on soft and sweet American bread.Kim Bell met Jones several times at the Grain Gathering. For the past two years, she has organised a UK version, the Grain Lab, a two-day event bringing together 150 farmers, millers and bakers from 14 countries to discuss issues of marketing, transport and cost.A supermarket loaf might cost about £1, a loaf from an artisanal bakery three or four times that. Inevitably, the price of sourdough has given it an elite, middle-class foodie tag. Supermarket bread sells at wafer-thin margins, and big bakeries operate on giant economies of scale small bakeries have to contend with high rents and labour costs, expensive organic ingredients and a time-intensive process. Bakers defend the value of their loaves, their high satiety (one thick slice fills you up quite happily) and lower waste: supermarket bread is so undervalued that almost half of it is thrown away. Increasingly, we are beginning to understand the real costs of an industrialised food supply, not borne by the agro-food industry, but by the taxpayer. A study for the Sustainable Food Trust in 2017 suggested that when you have factored in the health costs of obesity and diabetes, environmental clean-up and subsidies, the real cost of our food is double what we pay for it in a shop.Bell and others are trying to put together local networks of supply, to create a new kind of grain economy inevitably, their efforts come up against the problem of how we value benefits that we can feel, rather than count. Bell told me that the connections she makes are often personal and unexpectedly moving (for example, when farmers taste bread baked with grain they have grown for the first time). For Bell, the quality of her relationships is as important as the quality of the ingredients.One day, more than three years ago, Josiah Meldrum, an organic farming activist, walked into Kim Bell’s bakery with a bag of YQ flour. Meldrum, co-founder of Hodmedod’s, a Norfolk company selling and championing British legumes, was a close friend of Martin Wolfe and keen to help him get bakers interested in YQ. He told Bell the story of YQ and asked her if she would try baking with it, explaining apologetically that YQ had a relatively low protein content. Most bakers would have been put off, but Bell smelled its toasty nuttiness and was intrigued.Her first efforts produced tough, dense loaves, or the dough became a puddle of unshapeable slop. Bell tried varying the proportions of starter, upped hydration levels, reduced the temperature, mixed it vigorously instead of gently. “It was just trial and error really.” She wanted to bring out the flavour of the wheat. Finally, she was satisfied and had a domed loaf with a dark umber crust and a russet interior of soft, pillowy crumb that she could take to show Wolfe at Wakelyns.Bell was nervous: “He’s a bit famous.” But they ended up spending all day talking. “He was delighted, because he had been working on this project for 20 years and scientists were fascinated by it, but he couldn’t seem to get a baker to bake with it.” Bell and Wolfe recognised in each other the other half of an equation. For Bell, the YQ wheat represented “everything we had been thinking about in the bakery, ersification and decentralisation, resonated back down to the seed.”Since the early 20th century, seeds that are sold commercially have had to be legally registered according to variety. In this way, buyers are protected and breeders can receive royalties on plants they have spent time and money developing. Accordingly, seeds and plant varieties must conform to certain criteria for uniformity and stability. But YQ is genetically thousands of different varieties of wheat, known as a “population”. As such, it could not be legally registered, or traded, in Europe.When Bell fell in love with YQ and its story, Wolfe had been growing it for almost 15 years. In the US, they were continuing to develop populations, as were a few agronomists in France, Germany and Italy. But generally, these were a new, untested type of crop. Between 2007 and 2013, YQ went on a tour around Europe, to see how it would grow in different climates. The results showed that even in varying weather conditions and soils the overall yield of YQ was remarkably stable.In the meantime, Wolfe went back and forth between Brussels and Westminster to lobby for an exception to the EU regulations that would allow YQ to be sold. Finally, in 2014, he was successful, and in July 2017 YQ seed, officially called the ORC Wakelyns Population, was the first population wheat to go on sale in Europe.Bell wanted to use YQ flour at the Small Food Bakery, but she needed to find a farmer to grow it. She asked Paul Wyman at Tuxford Mill if he had any ideas. Wyman sourced a lot of his organic wheat from John and Guy Turner, who had a family farm in Lincolnshire, 40 minutes down the A1. He suggested giving them a call.The Turner brothers at Grange Farm are fourth-generation farmers with 100 hectares (250 acres). Over the decades, they had watched other small farmers around them struggle and sell up. So, in 2001, they decided to go organic. “Basically, we’ve been holding on by our fingertips for the last 30 years,” John Turner told me. They had begun to send their wheat to Paul Wyman when they were looking for a way to sell a few tonnes of extra grain. When Bell asked if they would be interested in planting YQ the brothers said: “OK. Why not?”“Over the winter, we weren’t too sure about it at all,” Guy told me. “It was quite a spindly, thin crop. But then in the spring, when the weather warmed up, it just absolutely took off. You could almost sit at the edge of the field and watch it grow.”Bell continued to champion YQ to other bakers and gave baking demonstrations with it at her Grain Lab. Ben Mackinnon at E5 Bakery in London Fields, which mills its own flour at its premises under a railway arch, grew up on a farm near Wakelyns, knew Wolfe (he once spent a month digging up potatoes for him) and said he would take four tonnes. Turner was delighted. The only problem was how to get the grain to London. Turner suggested he take a load on a trailer hooked up to his 4X4. He soon got lost in the narrow streets. “I felt like a real hick from the sticks,” he said, laughing. I said he was doing something that probably hadn’t been done in 150 years: a farmer transporting his own grain into central London to be milled.When I visited E5 in April, they had almost run out of the Turner’s YQ and had begun to source it from another farmer in Essex. Word had gone around, artisanal bakers were excited by the YQ story and its flavour almost the whole 2018 crop had sold out.Martin Wolfe died after a short illness in March. We had been in touch and he had invited me to come to see his farm. Two weeks after his death, his son David and Josiah Meldrum kindly met me at Wakelyns. It was a brittle spring day, bright spots of sun in a cold wind.They showed me Martin’s office – a mess of papers, slides of mildewed barley leaves, a nest of wires on the floor, chainsaw parts. In the sheds and barns, there were tractors and combine harvesters and all sorts of Heath Robinson-esque machinery he had modified for his experiments. “There’s not much you can’t do with a Ribena bottle,” David laughed, pointing to plastic bottle taped to a stick. “Everything tied up with baler twine,” Meldrum added. “Martin would never let a good idea be stymied by not having the right equipment.”And here were the avenues of trees, and between them alleys of clover and blades of green YQ. The trees were splotched with green and white and pink blossom, 40 kinds of apple, multiples of pear, plum. There were the prints of muntjac deer and hares in the mud and thrushes warbling in the hazel.We walked through a hedge and came out on to a lane as a blast of raw wind, unchecked by trees, blew into our faces. Before us was a 40-hectare expanse of wheat on the neighbouring farm, as evenly green as a billiard table. The contrast between the variegated beauty of Wakelyns agroforestry and this conventionally farmed field could not have been more stark.We are only beginning to understand the importance of ersity and the complex systems that plants – and animals, and us – need to thrive. In an interview, Martin Wolfe once argued that value should be accounted not just according to the cash received for a crop, but to the effect of the plants on the soil and carbon sequestration, and wider effects “on mood, on beauty, on community”. The story of YQ spins a narrative from soil health to grain resistance to nutritious flour to tasty bread, and it also describes a group of people working together to create a local food network that nourishes a community.“Martin was always full of crazy ideas,” said his son. We walked to the end of a grassy meadow. His wife Ann’s grave was marked with a simple stone among stands of daffodils. In April, Martin was buried next to her.As a result of his lobbying, YQ wheat will receive legal status to be traded from the EU in 2021. Before he died, Bell told me: “I’m buoyed by Martin. Last year he said to me: ‘Kim, it’s happening, I’m seeing it for the first time in my life. It’s going to come. Things are changing.’”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25c15131251df2a3a7ab9007bf13109c04898a4/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c06794d0b4c601f0e573bd4b7c83db5","title":"the gospel of mushrooms how foraging became hip","story":"Searching for fungi has long had an old-world mystique. But for generations coming of age during the climate crisis, the powerful organisms are more important than everCassandra Posey was a 25-year-old fashion branding consultant living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan when, in the spring of 2018, she and a girlfriend got into a near-stranger’s car bound for Baltimore. The driver was a friend-of-a-friend named William Padilla-Brown, a dreadlocked permaculturist who sold mushrooms and their cultures from his home in Asheville, North Carolina.He and Posey had recently begun exchanging messages on Instagram, where they bonded over a shared interest in plant-based medicines. When Padilla-Brown offered to drive Posey to a workshop he was giving on spirulina cultivation, she lied that her friend was going through a difficult breakup and would need to tag along, just in case the ride should warrant a wingwoman.“We hopped in the car,” Posey recalls, “and I’ll never forget, he was playing some creepy house music and I was like, ‘Oh, it’s going to be one of those rides’, you know?”But almost immediately, they became a couple about as quickly, Posey started a mushroom business of her own. Within a year, joined by Padilla-Brown’s four-year-old son, Leo, they would relocate to a farm in rural Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, to raise chickens, tend a garden – and spread the gospel of fungi.As far as hobbies go, mycology – the study, collection and cultivation of fungi – has never been wildly removed from the mainstream. Upwards of 90 local mushroom clubs exist throughout the US and Canada members host foraging walks and help each other tackle subtle taxonomical variants.Despite its quiet proliferation, mushroom hunting has, until recently, retained something of an old-world mystique. The age demographic associated with the activity has been, accordingly, not exactly young. But sometime in the last decade, there’s been a shift.On Instagram, hashtags like #mushroomhunting and #mushroomsofinstagram have been used more than a million times. The photos depict prized edibles on the forest floor – crinkle-capped morels or vase-like chanterelles – and, naturally, bright-eyed influencers proudly cradling armfuls of Technicolor chicken of the woods.As younger generations come of age in an era of climate catastrophe, more and more members of the Gen Z and millennial cohorts are turning to the earth for answers to their own wellbeing – and the health of the planet. Their burgeoning mushroom madness just might be the quintessential sign of the times.Posey, Padilla-Brown, and little Leo were among the more than 300 mushroom enthusiasts – most in their 20s and 30s – who recently set up camp on a tract of land in upstate New York’s Adirondack Park for the second annual New Moon Mycology Summit.The summit’s packed program included workshops on DIY mushroom cultivation and guided walks to identify medicinal plants. Environmental stewardship was a recurrent theme of conversation throughout, which was infused with the language of anti-capitalist activism and an emphasis on living more reciprocally with nature amid an economy of extraction.“People are seeking the return-to-the-land thing,” says Olga Tzogas, a co-organizer who runs Smugtown Mushrooms in Rochester, New York.Now 34, she was 20 when she got into mycology through a community college class. When she joined her first mushroom club shortly thereafter, she encountered few other fungi hobbyists under the age of 50. “But,” she notes, “with social media, it’s definitely changed and accelerated, with a lot more younger people.”The mass proliferation of social media coincides with resurgent interest in the medicinal potential of various wild mushroom species. The trend has been amplified by the Gwyneth Paltrow-approved Moon Juice proprietress, Amanda Chantal Bacon, whose line of mushroom-infused nutritional supplements (or “dusts”) sell SoCal yoga mom allure to the well-heeled masses. But those in the know would probably argue that contemporary mycologists like Paul Stamets, Tradd Cotter and Peter McCoy walked so that Bacon, with her Goop-ified potions, could run.“They really brought the world of medicinal fungi and permaculture, remediation, and things like this to the forefront,” says the New York Mycological Society president, Tom Bigelow, “which is really intriguing and appealing to younger people.” Since the group set up an online payment option for club dues in 2012, membership has nearly tripled and become visibly age-erse.Bigelow joined the New York City mushroom club in 2007, 45 years after its founding by a group of amateur mycologists that included the avant-garde musician John Cage. For the past two years, he and a fellow member have undertaken an intensive survey project cataloguing nearly 850 fungi species – and counting – across New York City.“There’s so much potential with fungi and what they’re able to do for the environment, the positive impacts they can have on us from a wellness standpoint,” says Bigelow. “It’s become really entrenched in popular culture now. People’s minds are blown by it, and they want to learn about it.”New biomedical research, while not yet definitive, is promising. Cordyceps, for instance, contain a compound that may boost cognition and memory. Studies suggest that other mushrooms, such as turkey tail and chaga, may even slow the growth of cancer cells.Of course, the medical use of mushrooms is far from new. Otzi, the Neolithic man whose frozen body was found in the Italian Alps in 1991, had birch fungus on his tool belt that may have been used to treat intestinal parasites. Penicillin and the first generation of the cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, are among many pharmaceutical agents that derive an active ingredient from fungi.And yet, western society has until lately suffered what Tzogas calls “fungi phobia”. For centuries, people didn’t understand the biology of mushrooms, why they would show up without warning after a rainy day. Some you could eat, while others, if ingested, could produce visions of the devil.Therein lies the appeal. The study of fungi is fundamentally about the joy of mastery, of learning the taxonomies and ecology of a notoriously complex family of organisms. The stakes are thrillingly high: anything less than absolute certainty in one’s identification of a wild edible mushroom species can land its eater in the hospital – or, in some circumstances, the grave.Despite the risks, mycology offers a seemingly bottomless well of discovery. There is an inherent optimism in its pursuit. A recent memoir by the anthropologist Long Litt Woon details how the author’s obsessive mycological immersion helped her cope with the unexpected death of her husband. “Mushroom outings gave me the push I needed to get out of the house and take part in life,” she writes.Endlessly complex, mushrooms unlock a portal of exciting possibility – a future that utilizes regenerative, fungus-derived plastics and Styrofoam-like packing materials, and that even taps into mycelial networks to graft artificial organs. The growing discipline of mycoremediation has opened new windows for harnessing mycelia to filter environmental pollutants and, as Tzogas puts it, help “clean up the messes humans have made”.Then, of course, there’s the other kind of magic associated with mushrooms. Mounting interest in the psychotherapeutic and cognitive benefits of hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms came to a head last year with the author Michael Pollan’s paean to psychedelics, How to Change Your Mind, which became an instant bestseller.The podcaster Joe Rogan, a vocal advocate of psilocybin use and legalization, beat Pollan to the chase with a lengthy 2017 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience in which the mycologist Paul Stamets declared his belief that “psilocybin should be looked upon as a nootropic vitamin”.But the psychedelic piece of our fungal future may pose some of the most immediate questions about mushrooms’ relationship to social and environmental ethics, responsibility and the justice system. A keynote panel discussion at the New Moon summit considered how the recent decriminalization of psilocybin mushrooms in cities such as Denver and Oakland, California, might affect communities of color, cutting to the heart of the complex and intersecting societal implications just beneath the surface of fungi’s fascinating science.As has been true of the legal cannabis industry, those who stand to profit most from an above-ground psilocybin marketplace are unlikely to resemble the mostly racialized and, often, poor casualties of the country’s continuing war on drugs. (The PayPal billionaire and Gawker foe Peter Thiel stepped in last year as a major investor in the psychedelics startup Compass Pathways.)It is a cruel but maybe unsurprising irony that the biggest liability in mycological discovery is us, the human beings poised to put its possibilities into practice. Fungi may eventually offer some measure of environmental relief from the contaminants we’ve created, but it cannot make us stop contaminating. Medical discovery will not, in and of itself, ensure equitable access to mushroom-based therapies, nor will it guarantee the sustainable cultivation of associated species.To fully reap whatever riches may emerge from within the fungal kingdom, we will need to reconsider some of our most deeply ingrained habits as a species with a demonstrated knack for destruction. Our collective missteps are, of course, what have made the prospects so enticing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/742d3ed35fec7abf00e03bfab7a24f2fe57e7977/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12aa24e09433b0e852b33db864b3b3b2","title":"who needs bananas how to blend a better smoothie","story":"There’s more to a good smoothie than a load of sweet fruit. With the right ingredients it can be a meal in a glassThe smoothie is a classic good resolution, right up there with eight glasses of water a day and trying to see things from the other person’s point of view. I’ll swap my croissant for a smoothie. Or my double espresso for a smoothie. Or my full English for a smoothie. Then, so long as I wash my blender straight after so I don’t immediately descend into kitchen entropy, I will be a better person, packed with vitamins and full till lunchtime.Like all good intentions, this remains more or less preserved in aspic if you never stick to it, you never need to update it. But nutritionists have fallen out of love with smoothies.Unlike juicing, blending fruit keeps most of the roughage. Smoothies still fell out of fashion a bit when it was established that it is better for satiety to simply eat the ingredients. However, while it might come naturally to eat an apple and maybe a banana, you are unlikely to want to sprinkle some kale over either, less likely still to spread them with cashew butter. These are the key elements for nursing smoothies back into favour: vegetation and protein. The Nutribullet website has a ton of recipes, and a fair number of them include protein powder, which I disapprove of. But there are other ways to boost protein, and that’s the fashion: lower sugar, higher protein, while still fitting through a straw and being an appetising colour, which is to say not grey.There are two main routes to making things less sweet but still palatable: nutty or zingy. Almond milk is mysteriously good. You can use it with a banana base, but it’s so silky in its own right, and has enough heft, that you don’t need to. (It’s good, if only for the soul, and the frail human need for variety, not to make all your smoothies with bananas.) A teaspoon of nut butter – peanut is tastier, cashew less assertive – rounds out the texture and makes it more filling. You’re missing a trick if you don’t add greens, since they pump up the healthiness without hugely changing the taste (if you want to change it, add rocket, but not until you get to zingy). Spinach is the favourite, though that tends to mean baby spinach, for mildness. Kale is particularly good with cherries, whose sweetness is quite fierce and distinctive (unlike strawberries, which have more of a cutesy flavour and taste like a mistake when set against a strong green vegetable). Blueberries are good with celery, like a married couple who seem incredibly different but who have elemental similarities that you only notice once they’re both dead. That isn’t a very nice colour, however, a kind of mauve that elsewhere in life would be discontinued and end up in TK Maxx. Beetroots are good but you have to steam them, which defeats the raw-purity agenda a bit beetroot greens are surprisingly good with almost everything.Zing is generated mainly by lime and ginger the theory, I think, is that they sort of blow your head off and you experience the smoothie more as a sensation than a taste. Apple, cucumber and parsley, ginger and lime is a hand-grenade start to a day.I retain a lot of affection for avocado in a smoothie, but if you have one ripe enough (it has to be perfect), it’s tempting just to eat it.The big newcomers to the scene are: cauliflower, which you have to keep to a low proportion otherwise it makes it mealy (the texture not “like a meal”) coconut water, which again, you have to keep to modest amounts, otherwise everything tastes of coconut (if you wanted it to taste of coconut, I would recommend actual coconut) flax seeds, which are satiating and good for vegans (mainly because of omega-3) ashwagandha – which literally means “smell of a horse” in Sanskrit, but in fact does not smell of a horse – is unobtrusive and apparently has a calming yet exhilarating effect that, I must admit, I did not notice and custard apples, which genuinely taste of custard.Never put turmeric in a smoothie, even though people will persistently tell you to. It’s just a fancy way of turning it the colour of turmeric."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076fdf7bee398f58faa543c2ec60029bddfa1e6f/414_27_2502_1501/master/2502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7f45890dac97b184c4cb703378c798","title":"jose mourinho rejects lyon chosen another club","story":"José Mourinho turned down an approach from Lyon because “he has already chosen another club”, according to the French team’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas.Aulas is trying to recruit a successor to Sylvinho, who was sacked on Monday after only 11 matches in charge, and the 70-year-old said he had discussed the job with Mourinho.“We had some fairly flattering exchanges over SMS,” Aulas was quoted by Get French Football News. “It was nice for everyone.

The decision to creak open the gates is a reluctant one.After tickets were released on 3 October for a single, women-only block in the 78,000-seat stadium they sold out within minutes. Women photographed and tweeted pictures of their prized purchases and, as a further three blocks were made available, each was filled in turn.As Amnesty International said this week, the restrictions placed on women attending and lack of commitment beyond this single event illustrate that this game is being used as a “cynical publicity stunt”.The death of “Blue Girl” Sahar Khodayari a month ago was a horrific but significant step forward in the campaign to open the stadiums of Iran to women. Until that moment, Fifa and the Iranian FA were getting away with dragging their feet, the world governing body having looked the other way for decades as its rules on discrimination and human rights were broken.Yes, Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, wrote letters to the Iranian FA, most recently in June, which the world governing body said included requests for a clear timeline and assurances that women wanting to attend the qualifiers would be able to do so and Fifa claims those letters were “answered positively”. But in March 2018 Infantino himself had been inside the stadium hosting the Tehran derby between Esteghlal and Persepolis while 35 women were arrested outside.In her death Khodayari, who set herself on fire outside the courthouse she was being summoned to to face charges in connection with attempting to enter the stadium while disguised as a man, exposed the snail’s pace of change and forced action to be expedited with international observers aghast and watching.It is a campaign that represents more than the right to watch football: it challenges ingrained attitudes in Iranian society, challenges the exclusion of women from public spaces, exposes the viciousness with which the state and religious institutes and their representatives will clamp down on change and it acts as a beacon to other movements and campaigns emerging in the country. The government and FA are so resistant to making concessions because they do not want to embolden campaigners to fight for further changes or allow them to broaden the conversation.It is also a movement that highlights the power of football. If Fifa were to convincingly threaten sanctions and demand immediate change instead of seemingly accepting a somewhat incremental and drawn-out process riddled with excuses (women’s toilets are too expensive, separate entrances have to be arranged, doing it one-off international fixture at a time, etc) then it could play a role in fundamentally altering conditions in a country known for its oppressive restrictions on women.Some will undoubtedly say we should welcome and cheerlead even the smallest steps in the right direction. But with at least 40 women having been arrested in the past two years, according to Human Rights Watch, some of whom have been prosecuted and have criminal records, and with the “bearded ladies” who attempted to enter in disguise still on bail awaiting charges, there should be no let-up in the pressure being applied internationally and internally.If the Iranian government and FA are unwilling to at least drop charges against those who have fallen foul of the outdated ban that is not law but crept in as the political Islam of Ayatollah Khomeini took control of the 1979 revolution which birthed the Islamic Republic of Iran, then no goodwill should be afforded them.This one-off match is not the first: some women were allowed to attend the Asian Champions League final last November with Infantino in attendance. But the progress is painstakingly slow. With zero indication that women will be allowed into domestic games any time soon and the next home international match not until 26 March 2020 there is a big gap in the calendar.There is no reason why the doors cannot be flung open to women on Thursday. The token number being allowed through the segregated turnstiles and walkways into seating that has had high metal fencing welded around it, is just that: tokenistic.Accommodating this gesture is not enough. A complete lifting of the ban, the removal of charges against women facing prosecution and the removal of criminal records for those who have fought to be allowed to enter should be the bare minimum demands placed on the country’s governing body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a59c95293cabe154711c9e78dcd1e6e0d89bc1/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80a96c6fc4d2c13a5e1be3e5d0d10c5","title":"next generation 2019 60 of the best young talents in world football","story":"Eidur Gudjohnsen’s son, the new Paul Pogba and Barça’s Ansu Fati are among our 60 most talented players in the world born in 2002.

Ever since their 2008 single One Day Like This became not just a hit, but an omnipresent part of British life: there was a lengthy period when no sporting achievement or victory in a TV talent show was allowed to be televised without it blaring buoyantly on the soundtrack. Elbow have enjoyed a decade as Britain’s leading purveyors of ballad-paced, bruised-but-warm northern optimism. In fairness, that’s rather a reductive view of their subsequent output, but equally, no Elbow album since has been allowed to pass without at least one song that fitted the bill: string-laden, stately paced, its central message essentially “come ’ere, you daft bugger, give us a hug”.Hearing them repudiate their most popular mode comes as a shock, but then, desperate times call for desperate measures, and the circumstances of Giants of All Sizes’ recording sound grim. Quite aside from events in the outside world, it was marked by a string of deaths among the band’s circle, including that of Garvey’s father. The result is a succession of troubled songs that frequently question Elbow’s USP. “How do you keep your eyes ablaze,” wonders Garvey, “in these faith-free, hope-free, charity-free days”? The answer often seems to be: you can’t.The music similarly plays against type, or at least the popularly held view of type. When they first started attracting widespread interest, one of the most frequently remarked upon things about Elbow was the band’s unabashed love of progressive rock: still a ballsy thing for a hotly tipped alt-rock band to admit 20 years ago. Its influence has never really left them – on any given Elbow album you’re never that far from a song that sounds shimmering, aching but uplifting and suggestive of long teenage hours spent listening to The Carpet Crawlers by Genesis on repeat – but it’s more prevalent here than ever: it’s telling that Giants of All Sizes is being released as a limited edition single track CD, as if it’s a suite of songs, rather than a collection of them.You can hear the influence in the complex but tightly woven mesh of instruments on Empires and the opener Dexter \u0026amp Sinister, which starts out driven by a distorted bass riff not a million miles removed from that on The Seldom Seen Kid’s Grounds for Divorce, but seems to turn into a different song entirely midway through. Moreover, if it never lacks melodies – Seven Veils and My Trouble are particularly lovely – Giants of All Sizes digs into prog’s more disruptive side, the wilful awkwardness expressed by its jarring time signatures, unpredictable shifts and knotty cramp-inducing riffs.The result is what you might call a dislocated Elbow, noticeably light on songs that might cause festival crowds to hug each other and raise plastic pint pots aloft, big on taking their signature motifs and upending them. “All together now,” offers Garvey midway through Dexter \u0026amp Sinister. What follows isn’t a singalong chorus, but a rambling piano solo. Guitar solos you expect to be soaring inducements to punch the air never quite achieve lift-off: they rasp too harshly, come sprinkled with moments of squeaky discord or are possessed of an ungainly, staggering gait. When the strings arrive on The Delayed 3:15, they don’t provide the usual stirring, epic swell: they follow a twitchy, scattered pattern played on a clarinet. The net result is as agitated and troubled as the song’s narrator, who’s watching the body of a suicide being extracted from beneath a train by “pale-faced kids in rubber gloves, dressed as cops”. Doldrums, meanwhile, features a very Elbow-ish lyrical sentiment – “all of this stuff in our veins is the same” – but it’s depicted as a sentiment only “desperate men” would suggest. The song’s climax repeats the line over and over again, but defies you to join in: one voice distractedly mutters it, another wheezes and pants the line between gulps of breath.It’s debatable whether Elbow’s patent brand of warmth and optimism really is redundant in the current climate: one of the striking things about Nick Cave’s rapturously received Ghosteen was how empathetic and hopeful its songs sounded, potentiated by the fact that empathy and hope are two things in short supply at the moment. But the galvanising effect on Elbow’s sound isn’t really up for question. Musically, Giants of All Sizes is richer and stranger than anything they’ve released since their commercial breakthrough. Even when it finally settles back into more comfortable lyrical terrain – My Trouble’s hymning of cosy domesticity, On Deronda Street’s paean to parenthood – the music strays beyond their usual comfort zone: ragged and underpinned by glitchy electronic beats. It suits them out there.The best recommendation you can offer the former Chairlift singer’s latest solo single is that its delicate, understated take on AutoTuned pop is as good as its title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1cd7b2349e74d49029d0f72b5f365c96a47d4b/2238_1224_3059_1835/master/3059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929aed1b355630d27c3a3c82f011e508","title":"eu nationals lacking settled status could be deported minister says","story":"Brandon Lewis says people who do not apply before 2021 may be removed from UKThe security minister, Brandon Lewis, has threatened EU citizens with deportation from the UK if they do not apply for settled status after Brexit.Home Office figures show a million of the estimated 3 million EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, which will allow them to stay in the UK.In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Lewis said these people risked being deported if they failed to apply by the end of 2020. “If EU citizens have not registered by then without an adequate justification, the immigration rules will apply,” Lewis said.Asked whether those who did not apply in the next 14 months would face deportation even if they fulfilled all legal conditions for a residence permit, Lewis said: “Theoretically yes. We will apply the rules.”Campaigners said the comments suggested the government was planning to renege on a promise to EU citizens.The3million, a group representing EU citizens living in Britain, said it was the first time the government had confirmed what would happen to those who did not apply for settled status.Because of Brexit, EU (excluding British and Irish citizens), EEA or Swiss citizens need to apply to the EU settlement scheme if they wish to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021.Applicants are given given either settled status or pre-settled status. The status granted depends on how long they have been living in the UK. The government states that people\u0027s rights will be different depending on which status they get.Guidelines state applicants will usually get settled status if they’ve lived in the UK for a continuous five-year period. Pre-settled status will be granted to those who have not lived in the UK for five years, or cannot demonstrate that they meet this requirement.The government states that both settled and pre-settled status confer the right to:There are some significant differences though. Those with settled status will be allowed to stay in the UK as long as they like, and can spend up to five years in a row outside the UK without losing their status.Those with pre-settled status are allowed to stay in the UK for a further five years, which would allow them to apply to convert it into settled status.The status granted also affects any children people might have. With settled status, any children born in the UK will automatically be British citizens. With pre-settled status, the child would be born with pre-settled status, unless it qualified for British citizenship directly through one of the parents.The deadline for applying is 30 June 2021, or 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Irish citizens, or those who already have indefinite leave to remain, do not need to apply.Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the campaign, said: “We have pressed the government for years on what happens to those who do not have a status in 2021. Today, after much wait, it is confirmed that hundreds and thousands of people will be punished with the threat of removal from their home. This is no way to treat people, let alone what was promised.”The3million said many EU citizens in the UK were unaware of the requirement to register for settled status, while others were refusing to, as a protest against Brexit.Bohn said: “Those people who miss the tight deadline will face the full force of the hostile environment. That is the grim reality of the UK government’s position, no matter how many times they repeat the phrase: ‘EU citizens and their families are our friends, neighbours and colleagues and we want them to stay.’”The3million is calling for changes to the EU settlement scheme to guarantee rights to EU citizens even if they do not apply for settled status.Lewis later tweeted that his remarks had been taken out of context.Until now Home Office briefings have consistently tried to stress that officials will do everything they can to grant EU nationals the right to remain, and steered away from focusing on what would happen to those who failed to apply on time.One of the civil servants leading the settled status application scheme said: “This is about trying to grant the right. This is not about trying to trip people up … We’ve set this up from scratch. All this is here to try to say yes to European citizens, to try to give them their rights.”The Home Office’s position has consistently been to stress that if someone has a good reason to explain why they failed to apply by the deadline then they will be reasonable. The Home Office indicated that if people persistently fail to apply, then they will have no lawful status in the UK.Campaigners have asked for clarity on this point, noting that there was no clear explanation of what would be considered a “good reason” for failing to apply by the deadline.There is concern from campaign groups such as The3million that there could be tens of thousands of EU nationals in the UK who will fail to apply in time they are particularly concerned by what will happen to older and more vulnerable EU residents who may not be aware of the need to secure their rights after Brexit and who may struggle with the digital application process.As well as encountering difficulties with the Home Office, people who do not secure settled status may encounter problems applying for work or renting property, because employers and landlords will need to check that they are living in the UK legally.A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.“The EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.“We have received 2m applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.“We’ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they’ll be given a further opportunity to apply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/364feba2031666c6a92119e3c366b488cc3d70e6/1103_69_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8317b800b8e172277ebd42607b5294c9","title":"jeremy corbyn sets out labour election pitch and targets another upset","story":"Labour leader says he aims to tackle inequality and give young people hopeJeremy Corbyn has pledged to pull off another general election upset and recover from poor polling to deny Boris Johnson a return to Downing Street, as he effectively kicked off Labour’s campaign with a so-called alternative Queen’s speech setting out key policies.Speaking to party activists in Northampton, where both parliamentary seats are held by Conservative MPs with tiny majorities over Labour – Corbyn reeled off a list of plans in areas including Brexit, inequality, education, the NHS, housing, crime and the climate emergency.He said it was “the most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate”.Corbyn ignored a separate question about whether he would step down if he did not win the election.In his speech he said Labour was seeking a radical transformation of the UK so that young people could “look forwards to the future with hope”.“It’s not easy, I get all of that,” he said. “But the one thing this country can’t afford is the level of inequality that we have.”He said that when an election was called, Labour would mobilise hundreds of thousands of supporters to push its message.“That atmosphere and that message that things can and will be done very differently. Do we want our country run by a party that has cut, sliced, diced and privatised our public services, or do we want the ambition, enthusiasm and imagination of the Labour party to create that different and better society?”To cheers from the crowd, he concluded: “I’ll take that message out there. I’m very fit, I’m very healthy, I’m very happy, and I’m very, very determined.”Corbyn brushed off a suggestion that the party should be pushing for a second EU referendum before an election.“A second referendum is what we propose under a Labour government, which would be, as I have said, not a choice between a no-deal cliff edge but between an intelligent arrangement with the European Union and remain.”Many Labour MPs are worried about going into a general election at a time when the party is trailing badly in the polls, and they would rather see the issue of Brexit put to bed, allowing them to campaign on domestic issues.Corbyn dismissed the planned Queen’s speech by the government as a “cynical stunt”, saying it was “full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention and no means of delivering”.The rest of his speech was largely a list of previously announced Labour policies, including its plans for a so-called green new deal, reshaping the economy towards skilled, sustainable jobs.Asked about the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests in London, which Johnson and several government ministers have condemned, Corbyn praised the movement, predicting its leaders could even one day be commemorated on postage stamps, as earlier activists have been.“Their right to protest has to be upheld, that is what our democratic rights are all about,” he said. “Obviously protests must be conducted in a peaceful way, and every time anyone condemns people for protesting they should think for a moment where protest can lead.”He added: “Those women who stood up for the right for women to vote, the suffragettes, were condemned mercilessly by almost every newspaper in the country. They’re now on postage stamps.”Asked about the case of a US diplomat’s wife who left the UK after being sought in connection with a fatal road crash, Corbyn said the US should take action to return her.“I am alarmed and very concerned about that,” he said. “For somebody to be killed in our country and for the person who did it then to flee to the United States and then to claim diplomatic immunity is completely unacceptable.”He condemned comments by Donald Trump that US citizens sometimes drove on the wrong side of the road in the UK. “I just think that’s the most crass, insensitive comment that anyone could ever make,” Corbyn said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f88c106531df82aebfdbe23a249dd8b37adc78/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73910d68e99309449a77f37fe477efed","title":"nissan no deal brexit would jeopardise entire european business model","story":"Imposition of WTO tariffs on exports could put Sunderland plant at risk, says chair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fca6e3685824d8b9bba53fab53c341781ad774/639_1035_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958f04b1405ebc1a149c59f682d0cef","title":"brexit and the irish border is there a solution","story":"Lisa O’Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal.

It is every child’s right to live in a world that promotes, not harms, their health.”Among the recommendations are bans on promoting and advertising junk food, which would prevent deals such as that just struck between the England and Wales Cricket Board and KP Snacks. She also called for a ban on eating and drinking on public transport with exceptions for drinking fresh water and eating and drinking for medical conditions. In addition, she recommended price hikes through VAT changes on junk foods high in salt, sugar or fat, with the option of plain packaging as there is for cigarettes.Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.\u0026nbspThe NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called \u0027free sugars\u0027. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.Her report, she said, “is aimed at politicians and policy makers, now and in the future”. It was intended to reframe the issue, she told the . Obesity is about children’s right to a healthy life, Davies said, adding that the public want the government to take action to deal with it and politicians need no longer fear accusations of nanny statism.She said: “I think the polling data is pretty clear. The public think it’s time that governments acted to protect their children. Overweight and obesity is because we are all in this flood of unhealthy food marketing and advertising. We need to close those floodgates.“It’s the right of children to live in a healthy environment and with proper nutrition. What we’ve done to date has not stopped the problem.”Ten in every 30 primary school children are now overweight or obese. Each week the equivalent of 13 school buses of children are admitted to hospital for tooth extraction under general anaesthetic because of decay caused by sugar, she said, adding: “That’s damaging children, costing the NHS.”In later life it leads to heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.The report said England was “nowhere near” the government’s goal of halving childhood obesity by 2030. It proposes a lengthy list of radical taxation, legislative and other changes.Snacking on junk is common. Davies said: “It is now pretty normal to see people eating as they walk up the street. A couple of decades ago, it wasn’t. Portion sizes have crept up. £300m a year is spent on advertising unhealthy food and drink. Think about the cricket and what they’ve just agreed. It’s appalling.”Just as governments of the past protected children from working in the coal mines or sweeping chimneys, so they must now protect them from junk food and drink, she argued. There are 1.2 million children in need of medical help for clinical obesity. As many as 90,000 adolescents may be eligible for bariatric surgery – but fewer than 10 stomach-shrinking operations are done on this age group in a year.Davies said focusing on weight loss without changing the food environment “is like treating people for cholera and then sending them back into their homes where the water is still contaminated with cholera”.Companies have also reformulated soft drinks to escape the sugar tax. The report said: “Government must not shy away from regulation … the playing field is not level – it is too easy to make money from selling unhealthy food and too hard to make money from selling healthy food.” It recommends a shake-up of VAT after Brexit so the tax falls on junk food, while healthy foods would escape it and become cheaper.Davies hits hardest at government ministers. She said in the report: “The government has a duty as well as a moral responsibility to uphold children’s rights and therefore the quality of the environment in which they live. Ministers are in a unique position of influence to shape the environment.”In June, Boris Johnson told the Sun he was against extending the sugary drinks tax to milkshakes and in July announced a review of what he called sin taxes. Davies said her recommendations were for this government and those to come.Chris Askew, the chief executive at Diabetes UK, said it was “an urgent and ambitious call to action. The government have committed to halving childhood obesity by 2030, but their actions so far have been insufficient.”He added: “The bold and decisive recommendations outlined mean that this report cannot be ignored. Government must be brave and take urgent actions to affect the change we all want and need.”Sally Warren, the director of policy at The King’s Fund thinktank, said: “The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity. Some politicians may balk at the idea of the ‘nanny state’, but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume. Around two thirds of adults support the sugar tax and restricting junk food advertising, so there is a real opportunity for the government to build on Dame Sally’s report and turn these ideas into action.”Katharine Jenner, at Action on Sugar, said Davies’s “brave call for bold action is a beacon of hope” and that there was an urgent need to take unhealthy food and drink out of the spotlight by restricting promotions and marketing. A move that she said could only be achieved through legislation.Kate Halliwell, the head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), said the manufacturers should not be targeted. She said: “FDF member companies are committing time and resource to deliver the government’s various reformulation programmes – cutting salt, sugars and calories. In fact, FDF members are selling 57.3m fewer kilograms of sugars and 1tn fewer calories than they were back in 2015.“As Public Health England acknowledges, reformulating products takes time, and we must always take the consumer with us. We want government to support us in this work and not introduce punitive measures which might hinder it.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “Prof Dame Sally Davies has done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation over a decade as CMO. Her parting report is no different and we will study it closely and act on the evidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e641f4f9f10bca3bb8f6af2eaa15023aa82aac/0_331_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81715285e3a6ecddd1086d889d915ab4","title":"in search of smart chewing gum to help women conceive","story":"University of Copenhagen students on a mission to create chewing gum that accurately predicts female fertilityConical flasks of green liquid jiggle in rotating trays while women in white lab coats study yellowing yeast samples. One has grown into the shape of a smiley face. On the other side of the laboratory, something important is happening with vials, pipettes and foil-covered bottles containing what looks a lot like urine.The aim is to produce a chewing gum that accurately predicts the female fertility cycle. “We need to see if the active ingredient survives in chewing gum, then we’ll add flavours,” says one of the researchers, Anett Stèger.A team of 13 students from the University of Copenhagen is on a mission to create a product to help women improve their chances of getting pregnant. Biotechnology and molecular bioscience students have been working together to create a “smart chewing gum” that will change colour to show where women are in their menstrual cycles.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe plan is to replace baker’s yeast with human hormone receptors that can measure the oestrogen, LH and progesterone that are present in saliva when a woman is ovulating. The project, nicknamed “Ovulaid”, was started as a Danish entry into iGEM, the world championship in synthetic biology, which starts in Boston at the end of October.The researchers are an international bunch, with scientists from Nepal, India, Germany and Hungary as well as Denmark. Seven are women.“The competition can get quite intense,” says Stèger, who is Hungarian. “We’re working 40 hours a week on this, on top of our normal studies – so the drop-out rate is usually high. But we’ve only had one person leave. It’s a project we’re all really passionate about.”A fellow team-member, Hitesh Gelli Praveenkumar from India, first came up with the idea of a diagnostic gum when the group began brainstorming in February, before Benedicte Smith-Sivertsen, a Dane, suggested it could help women conceive.“My sister was going through fertility treatment at the time,” says Smith-Sivertsen, “and I was surprised by how hard it was – all these huge syringes and peeing on sticks every day. I just thought, why hasn’t anyone made this easier?”Most over the counter ovulation tests currently monitor LH levels, with higher end and more expensive ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen. “But we thought, what about a chewing gum that could do all of that, as well as measuring progesterone (which helps the uterus prepare for pregnancy) at a fraction of the cost?” says Stèger.There is clearly some work to be done. A prototype tastes a bit like wax.The researchers are working on a smartphone app to accompany the chewing gum for easy interpretation of the colour results and the gum is biodegradable.“The plan is that the gum will be very discreet in terms of packaging, available in supermarkets in a variety of flavours, and much, much cheaper than existing ovulation tests measuring LH and oestrogen that you pee on,” says Stèger.The hope is that Ovulaid will also have a developing world application. “We’ve conducted research with gynaecology clinics in rural India, where many hospitals don’t have the resources for regular fertility testing,” says Gelli, “so there’s a real excitement about the gum.”They’ve also looked into the impact it could have on areas such as Africa, where infertility is taboo. However, the market that may prove trickiest is Europe because the gum will contain a genetically-modified biosensor, and GM is tightly controlled in the EU.Dr Shabana Bora, a fertility specialist at the Lister Fertility Clinic in London not involved in the project, expressed cautious optimism about the work, saying “since many existing ovulation tests create a lot of plastic waste, a biodegradable gum could help be a more eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

And the veteran No 8 Parisse has pulled no punches in criticising tournament organisers for not relocating the fixture or altering the match day, instead simply cancelling the encounter and awarding both teams two points.“It is difficult to know that we won’t have the chance to play a match against one of the great teams,” said Parisse. “If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.“It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn’t like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no plan B, because it isn’t news that typhoons hit Japan.“Sure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we’d have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team.“The alternative is plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.”The hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini, who is 34, had to struggle to recover from a bad knee injury to make Italy’s squad and was due to be given his first action in Japan against New Zealand. It was to be in recognition of his 13 years and more than 100 Tests of commitment in the front row.Conor O’Shea described “horrible” disappointment among his players. Ghiraldini reportedly shed tears after a training session when news broke that the game had been cancelled.“I’m not saying we would have beaten them, but you want to finish on the pitch,” said the Italy coach. “Anything can happen and you’re very emotional especially for Leonardo Ghiraldini, who missed his last chance to play in an Italy jersey, and to hear that your international career is finished after training is tough to take.“These guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field.”The New Zealand coach, Steve Hansen, admitted he would have been frustrated had he been on the receiving end of the raw deal that Italy now find themselves lamenting.“If you want to be really ruthless, then it’s all about making sure you win the games on the way through because everyone knew this could be a possibility.“That’s pretty hard-nosed, though, because I know if we were in their situation we’d be disappointed not to have the opportunity to get there. So yes, there’s a lot of sympathy for them. But the right decisions are being made, because it’s all about safety.“It’s always a risk at this time of year with the typhoons, but this is when we play the Rugby World Cup. If you play it earlier, you run the risk of people dying on the footy field because it’ll be 40 degrees.“If you play it later, then that’s when we are finished for Christmas, so you’d have Santa Claus giving us the World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346590d7a4de066751ff2ac9418b4a30f47a6961/0_292_5328_3197/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a08a619b2105b38d7e3bc6e7f84db8","title":"losing by default to a typhoon scotland rugby fans braced for worst","story":"Scotland fans hope game against Japan can go ahead but anger and frustration at prospect of exit is giving way to pragmatismAs Scottish rugby fans contemplate the prospect of “losing by default to a typhoon”, initial anger and frustration at the threat of cancellation and lack of contingency planning is giving way to pragmatism.Tom Moore, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from the Scottish Lowlands village of Lochwinnoch, told the  that he would be “immensely disappointed” if Scotland’s match were cancelled, as has happened with the England v France game at the same venue in Yokohama on Saturday.But Moore, who has packed his uniform of a Loch Ness monster hat and kilt for watching the game, added: “If you follow Scottish sport, you’re used to saying the best thing is to get there early so you can have a good time before you lose. We’ve written the book on how to lose sportingly, but there’s not been a chapter yet on losing by default to a typhoon.”Moore, who is hoping still to get to the match with his son, questioned the fairness of drawing certain fixtures that can’t be played and what effect that will have on the overall integrity of the competition, saying: “It is a long tournament, and you would have thought there would be enough flexibility to delay until the weather improved.”Scottish Rugby has said that it fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, but online fans have vented their frustration at what they see as a lack of planning.Those watching from Scotland are also debating the different outcomes of cancellation versus playing. Craig Shearer, a Murrayfield season ticket holder from Dundee, explained: “We’re all being pragmatic here. I think the organisers have good procedures in place. Decisions are being taken in good time so fans are in no doubt as to what’s happening. When it comes down to it, this is about public safety and these guys are the experts.”But Shearer went on to raise a point that is being made by many: “The decision of World Rugby to give the World Cup to Japan in typhoon season is one to consider. The development of the Japanese (and tier two in general) is a big thing and this decision was taken as a very positive move. The risks of this happening must have been assessed.” Other fans also queried why World Rugby agreed to the rule that cancellation would be marked as a draw when it was likely to cause controversy.Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union is advising supporters who are already in Japan to heed the advice of the Foreign Office, which is “to follow all official advice, stay indoors and do not attempt to travel on Saturday”. There is an official warning for a continuous risk of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis across the country, which may well also affect the qualifying for the F1 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, which is also due to take place on Saturday.Cammy Black, the deputy editor of the Scottish Rugby Blog, said that the fans he is in touch with are keeping the drama in perspective. “Most fans have huge sympathy for Japan, it’s a massive tournament for them and they have really embraced the Scottish team. If it is cancelled it will be hugely disappointing for the players having worked up to this for four years, and the fans who have paid money to go out there. But we need to be level-headed when there’s a huge storm coming that’s going to affect lots of people’s lives and this is a game of rugby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d925c8a7668890f2ddc230fd01ff5c5c4513891/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61df5d4fd1f4e9f7e07bf0b182574c2b","title":"nba players coaches china reaction hong kong daryl morey","story":"A tweet supporting protestors in Hong Kong has caused a rift between China and the NBA. Do social-activist players have a duty to speak out?After years of taking heat for voicing their opinions on political and social issues, NBA players and coaches have found themselves this week being attacked for the exact opposite. With a cold war brewing between the NBA and China over a tweet made, and subsequently deleted, by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong, the league’s biggest names have mostly responded with a very loud silence. That in and itself has drawn criticism in the US, even while it has seemingly done nothing to appease China itself. Indeed, the Rockets are facing a boycott in China, and sponsorships and broadcasting deals for the whole league are under threat.NBA commissioner Adam Silver has attempted to placate everybody by expressing regret for Morey’s statements while reaffirming his employees’ rights to free speech. Unfortunately, he has been trying to find middle ground unaware that there is none. As a result, voices from both the left and right in the US have criticized him and the league for their attempts to apologize to a totalitarian government rather than risking profits in a huge market. Inevitably, the media has turned its attention to the “global ambassadors” of the game, the players themselves.Over the last decade, NBA players have gained a reputation for speaking out on issues in the US, ranging from gun violence to the abuses of the Trump administration. It has not gone unnoticed that, for the most part, they have been quiet about the entire situation in Hong Kong, where law enforcement has used live ammunition on civilians. OK, not every player has been quiet: Rockets star James Harden went out of his way to apologize to China. “You know, we love China. We love playing there,” he said on Monday. This overture did not move the country to stop the boycott of his team. Days later, workers began painting over murals depicting the Rockets, as if China were trying to physically erase the once-beloved team (the country’s greatest player, Yao Ming, was a star for years in Houston) from its cultural memory.There have been others who have made statements that were slightly less humiliating. The Portland Trail Blazers’ CJ McCollum, who has a sneaker deal with the Chinese brand Li-Ning, said, “it’s unfortunate that things have gotten to this point, but hopefully, we can get through it.” The Golden State Warriors’ Steph Curry made a comment that was closer to a no comment. “I don’t know that history well enough to kind of speak on it to form an opinion yet,” Curry said, “so that’s kind of where I’m at with this situation … I’m staying tuned like everybody else.”To a point, that’s entirely fair. The issues that NBA players have been vocal about have tended to be ones that directly affect them and their communities. When LeBron James and other NBA stars speak out about the realities of police brutality and gun violence in African American communities, it’s because they are subjects that they know intimately. We can’t expect them to intimately know the details of say, the Fugitive Offenders bill and the long-standing grievances between Hong Kong and mainland China (although the grim details of the extent of China’s crackdown on protestors have been widely reported).This explanation only goes so far, however. Players don’t have to know anything about the protests in Hong Kong to know that China’s disproportionate response to Morey’s tweet is a clear attempt to silence not just their bosses but themselves. The fact that players seem afraid to speak up about the issue is worrisome enough that it somehow has made temporary allies of figures on both sides of the political spectrum. Republican senator Ted Cruz and Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among politicians who co-signed a letter to Silver expressing their disappointment in the matter.In this one statement, you can see exactly why the NBA’s attempt to stay neutral has united left and the right. For those on the left (particularly those whom Slate describes as “the radical sports leftists”), it represents a clear-cut example of a corporation putting people over profits by compromising with an authoritarian country with an ongoing history of human rights violations. For those on the right – including those who might otherwise look away at a large corporation doing business with a totalitarian government – Communist China is a uniquely un-American entity, a convenient boogieman representing the dangers of leftism. For those whose opinions solely come from Fox News, those who find anybody to the left of, say, Mitt Romney indistinguishable from a Maoist firebrand, it becomes easy to use this incident to tar the predominantly liberal voices within the NBA.This, of course, is where President Trump comes into the picture. The head coaches of the Warriors and San Antonio Spurs, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, have been vocal critics of Trump since he took office. When Kerr declined to comment on the situation between China and the US and Popovich responded to questions by praising Silver’s handling of the matter, Trump spared no time in hitting back at the two figures, who have been openly critical of his presidency.“He was shaking, ‘Oh, I don’t know,’” Trump said of Kerr, “he didn’t know how to answer the question, and yet he’ll talk about the United States very badly.” Trump, somewhat more respectfully, pointed out that Popovich didn’t “want to say anything bad” about China.For those who have celebrated Kerr and Popovich for their outspokenness in the past, the worst part about Trump’s comments was that they weren’t wrong. When it comes to China, players and coaches alike appear to be genuinely afraid to say anything that could upset the situation any further. At best, this position leaves them open to accusations of hypocrisy. At worst, it’s evidence that China’s reaction to Morey’s tweet has already served its purpose in creating a chilling effect throughout the NBA. If that’s the case, the league has already lost this conflict."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a4a49a32e232979f2812602051796753fe91c66/0_0_4688_2814/master/4688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0761f5a54e2e7acb1d56749b40b425f","title":"should i fix my six year old laptop or replace it","story":"Pablo asks if it’s worth patching up an old ThinkPad T510 or best to buy a new Windows 10 laptopI have a Lenovo ThinkPad T510 purchased about six years ago. I’m perfectly happy with it, except the keyboard needs replacing and batteries seem to lose their ability to charge within a couple of years. The keyboard and battery could be replaced for less than $100. Other than those factors, is there any reason to replace the machine? If I buy a Windows 10 machine, could I or should I continue to run Windows 7 on it? PabloThere is no universal answer to your first question. The time to sell, repurpose or recycle an old PC depends on a large number of factors. Some are technical, such as the specification, the build quality, and whether it will actually run Windows 10. Some are personal, such as what you use it for, how much money you can spare, and whether your time has any value.Circumstances alter cases. It might not be worth replacing a very old PC that’s only used for personal emails, especially if the user is short of cash. On the other hand, it could make sense for a company to replace a high-spec machine that is only a few months old if time is extremely valuable, as it can be in financial organisations.However, your second question is easy. Windows 7 was launched in 2009, and reaches the end of its supported life in January 2020. After that, there will be no more security patches except for the companies able and willing to pay. I understand that Windows 7 Extended Security Updates for Windows Enterprise Edition will cost $25 per device for the first year, $50 for the second year and $100 for the third year. Windows 7 Pro charges are twice that, but still only half the typical charges for extending Windows XP support.Given that Windows 10 Pro can be set up to look and work much like Windows 7 Pro, it makes no sense to pay to extend Windows 7’s life unless your business absolutely depends on it.Even if you disregard the security risk, it’s a bad idea to try to run Windows 7 on hardware designed for Windows 10. Manufacturers don’t test their machines with obsolete operating systems. Even parts on the QVL (Qualified Vendor List) are not guaranteed to work.I am not saying it can’t be done. I am saying you should avoid it as an unnecessary risk.I replaced my previous laptop and desktop PCs when they were six years old, and I think this is a sensible strategy. Old machines may still work, but usually they will have been left behind by technological advances. In your case, the T510 is missing the UEFI system that provides fast start-up, M.2 slots for faster SSD modules, USB-C or Thunderbolt for faster connections, better on-chip graphics with video support, a camera for Windows Hello face-recognition log-on, and so on. You’re also missing out on a touch screen with tablet and pen capabilities.Of course, you can improve the performance of your Lenovo ThinkPad T510 by adding more memory and swapping the original hard drive for a fast SSD. Not everybody can. We’ve all seen the trend towards sealed cases, soldered-in memory and storage chips, glued-in batteries and so on. These make laptops more expensive to repair or upgrade, and therefore more disposable.Old PCs also consume more power, which makes them more expensive to run. Mid-range processors have not become dramatically faster, though having (usually) more cores does mean they work more smoothly. For the past decade, Intel has focused on providing more performance per Watt, rather than more raw performance. A typical laptop processor now runs at a TDP of about 15W, going down to 6W, instead of 35W or 45W. These new processors generate less heat, so they can be used in thinner, lighter and more portable laptops. Lower power consumption also provides longer battery life.Incidentally, I don’t feel bad about retiring laptops after six years, partly because I used to retire them after three years. My laptops do a lot of useful work and generally cost about the same as or less than smartphones that do less useful work and only last half as long.Also, I value my time, especially as I get closer to my own end-of-life recycling point. Some people think they are saving resources by using old machines that can’t cope with dozens (or hundreds) of browser tabs, take ages to download bloated web pages, are slow to load programs or copy files or whatever. That’s a waste of human resources. I won’t waste mine.Sadly, even if your ThinkPad T510 runs Windows 10, it has a lot of limitations. These include the screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), slow USB 2 ports, the fairly slow drive speed (SATA 2 is 3Gbps not 6Gbps no M.2 slot), the lack of memory (8GB is the max), and the slow CPU.If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, put what you would have spent on your T510 towards a refurbished ThinkPad with a much more recent processor, such as the T440 or the X250.But anyone spending that sort of money could put off purchasing a new laptop for about a year or so, because dual-screen machines look like the coming thing. The Asus ZenBook Pro Duo UX581 is a stunning piece of work, while the 14in ZenBook Duo UX481 is a more portable, and more affordable, alternative. Last week, Microsoft previewed its own dual screen machines, the Surface Duo Windows laptop and the Surface Neo Android phone, due about a year from now.I’ve seen a lot of terrible machines, but the Surface Duo looks like the real deal. I expect all the leading manufacturers to launch their own versions, which will establish it as a new form factor, as happened with the Surface Pro. I wouldn’t be shocked to see a dual-screen iPad…Have you got a question?

You won’t find the titular 17th-century painting, Carel Fabritius’ The Goldfinch, here. In real life it hangs in the Mauritshuis in The Hague – but you will find canvases by his master, Rembrandt, along with more modern works by the likes of Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso and David Hockney. You should also check out the elegant Frick Collection, which is also a must-see for art lovers in the city – not least because in late 2013, The Goldfinch was exhibited at the Frick for a few months.Theo is initially taken in by the affluent Barbour family, who live in an elegant high-rise apartment on prestigious Park Avenue. Try Upper East Side institution, French bistro Le Veau d’Or – or sample the cuisine somewhere equally refined, such as La Grenouille, or power-lunch favourite 21 Club. For sheer class, you can’t go wrong with cocktails at the Rainbow Room, whose Bar SixtyFive, at the top of the Rockefeller Center, is definitely the kind of place one would sip a Manhattan.Fancy yourself as an antique collector? While the film’s antique shop, Hobart and Blackwell, doesn’t actually exist, you’ll find the fabulous Manhattan Art and Antiques Center on 2nd and 56th. It’s a treasure trove of artefacts – from furniture (Hobie’s speciality) to porcelain, silver, fine art and more – spread over three floors. Furnish Green, on Broadway, is where to find mid-century modern pieces, art deco table lamps, and quirkier items such as classic comics.Without giving too much away, our young protagonist finds himself in the outskirts of Sin City, living with his father (Larry) and his father’s girlfriend (Xandra). There may not be much to do in the suburbs, but head to the Vegas Strip, where you can visit the Bellagio, one of Las Vegas’ most popular hotel casinos. Tourists flock to the impressive, daily fountain displays, but other draws include the magnificent collection of glass sculptures in the lobby by artist Dale Chihuly. If you want to try your luck at the tables, you can head over to the MGM Grand where you’ll also find 20 in-house bars and restaurants, including fine dining at Atelier de Joël Robuchon, and Wolfgang Puck’s Bar \u0026amp Grill. Theo and his new friend Boris clearly prefer steak – they steal one from a local supermarket. If steak is also your thing, make a beeline for somewhere classic such as the Golden Steer, one of the oldest restaurants in town, which serves up prime rib and filet mignon. Or treat yourself to melt-in-the-mouth Kobe beef at SW Steakhouse in the Wynn hotel. In search of a little culture in between the casinos? Centaur Art Galleries displays a range of works by artists as erse as Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali and Norman Rockwell.We won’t spoil how Theo Decker comes to be in a hotel in Amsterdam, but if the sight of the city’s signature canals appeals to you, there are several elegant waterside establishments worth checking into when you visit. Try the Pulitzer its bar was voted the best hotel bar in the city in 2019, with cocktails inspired by Ernest Hemingway. Or visit the Dylan, a stylish enclave in the hip, independent shopping area, the Nine Streets. The restaurant at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam is even named after the Pulitzer prize-winning book that the movie is based on the Goldfinch Brasserie serves elegant fare, including oysters and beef tartare.Chasers of The Goldfinch should be sure to visit some of the city’s magnificent museums and immerse themselves in the dramatic paintings adored by the film’s characters. The Rijksmuseum is possibly the greatest, where you’ll find Vermeer’s Milkmaid and Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. The Van Gogh Museum is home to Sunflowers, The Yellow House and several self-portraits. And, of course, you can visit the Mauritshuis in The Hague to see the title painting at the centre of the story.Based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, The Goldfinch is released nationwide on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5555234efe6a4751ef29cd592adaf2385797382d/713_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d0c75794a4a38bb52e8e387f401080","title":"ansel elgort nicole kidman finn wolfhard whos who in the goldfinch","story":"Who do you cast in the movie adaptation of a Pulitzer prize-winning novel?

Mmm, tell me more. One that takes us inside a wealthy media dynasty flouting every moral and judicial law in order to consolidate power? Ok. Here’s the best bit – there are no likeable characters! Sounds about as much fun as eczema. So why do I, like so many others, currently love Succession more than any other show on TV?For a start, watching it feels like getting the gossip. Sons Roman and Kendall’s battle for dominance echoes that of James and Lachlan Murdoch, sons, of course, of Rupert Murdoch. Daughter Shiv is partly based on US executive Shari Redstone, who forced her ageing media tycoon father’s hand to take control of his company. The Trump name swirls around this world too, like flies on faeces. Stories of Donald refusing to pay his contractors are legion, just like the storyline in the show that resulted in a revenge raccoon being shoved up Logan Roy’s chimney (none of which is a euphemism). Though of course the character of Connor Roy - the moronic, incompetent, hooker-dependent son who thinks he can be president - is wholly rooted in fiction.Moreover, it is fun. Unreasonably so. Succession has a kind of spontaneous, semi-improvised anarchy in its DNA. Actors are given multiple takes to horse around, with writers lobbing in alternate comic lines. Jesse Armstrong’s opus is tightly written, though – at points almost a screwball comedy. ‘Screw-you-and-a-kick-in-the-balls’ comedy would be more on the money, in fact. The command of language is absolute, most often in the service of childish insults.We’ve seen this before in The Thick Of It – one of Armstrong’s previous shows – but it is stranger, more deeply rooted in character here. A recent episode featured “horse potatoes!” a cutting interjection from old-world matriarch Nan Pierce later the insult “mole-woman” becomes somehow flirtatious in the mouth of Roman Roy, Kieran Culkin’s compulsively rude, stupid-intuitive imp.His superb character portrait is one of many in the show, all of which get deeper this time around. Kendall, tied to his father by tragedy and blackmail in the first season finale, has become a lugubrious enforcer. He strides around acquiring then firing startups like Darth Vader in pinstripe. Their empathetic, liberal sister Shiv is a conniving chameleon, and her panicky husband Tom a social climber hampered by the lack of a spine. Best of all there’s Brian Cox as Logan Roy, mercurial CEO of media company Waystar Royco. Swinging from post-stroke confusion to boardroom satanism, he has more charisma to burn than there are trees in the Amazon. He was largely absent last season, an Ibsen patriarch haunting his offspring from offstage. This time round, he’s running the game.The show is so satisfying to watch, so casually masterful. The cinematography and score are biting and beautiful. The writing nails an extraordinary range of tones, each series commencing with a knockabout energy that tightens into tragedy by its close. But while it is very, very funny, what I love about the show is its cruelty. TV often trades in sentimentality: narrative sugar-pills, little engineered reversals of fortune that persuade us our own happy ending is around the corner. Succession isn’t about that. The only ‘journey’ we’re taken on here stops off at every circle of hell. I find it bracing. Like being slapped with the truth, not kissed by a lie.The Thick Of It showed us Westminster less as a parliament, more like a hard-play area for overgrown toddlers. Succession broadens the lens. Watching this wild west intersection of politics, media, tech and finance reminds us we are all collateral damage in a turf war between psychopaths. It’s Game of Thrones, but with real blood: ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44618d821f6cf1dd1525b3c2f1e41b26e521fc34/110_0_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6b5910a53c48819e367b27501d3b37","title":"come on now why tv needs way more female orgasms big mouth fleabag gentleman jack","story":"Women masturbating on screen was once the stuff of taboo, but a new wave of refreshingly radical shows are closing TV’s pleasure gap at lastBeing introduced to Netflix’s Big Mouth has been such a thrill. My girlfriend’s 16-year-old daughter sold it to me, promising a talking vulva voiced by Kristen Wiig, a sassy hormone ‘monstress’ (Maya Rudolph) and a whole world of inclusive, body-positive bits about the messy reality of growing up. It is clever, pleasingly surreal and an absolute hoot. I was sold from the first watch.The new series focuses on the obstacle-strewn path young women tread when exploring their sexuality in adolescence. To me, it is the best yet. Watching episode six, How to Have an Orgasm, feels quietly revolutionary. In it, Jessi – a droll, whip-smart girl you wish had befriended you at school – learns how to come for the first time. Watching it feels new, exciting and radical because the business of female pleasure is rarely dealt with so centrally and without shame.It begins with Jessi’s vulva – a separate, talking entity – holding a microphone and hosting a game called “Do the Thing!” Connie (Rudolph’s hormone monstress) cheers her along with a rallying cry of “let’s touch our genitals” as she experiments under the covers with her hand. Pleasure is elusive. Her vulva offers continuous feedback: “That’s a little pokey, you’re not trying to squash a bug.”Turning to porn for inspiration, Jessi comes across a video called Bethany’s First Orgasm, in which Bethany uses a vibrator. Jessi goes to a shop with her friend Missy (Jenny Slate) to see what’s available. A talking Harry Potter vibrator falls off the shelf and buzzes across the floor. She doesn’t buy anything but the conversation between the two friends, in which Missy plainly states that “a glow worm and a bath faucet really gets the job done”, is striking, considering how much shame still exists around how women experience pleasure.Indeed, whether it’s humping a pillow, angling a shower head or using a vibrator, the idea of women young or mature putting their pleasure first has been historically controversial. I remember my heart sinking when Sally Draper was carted off to a psychotherapist for masturbating in Mad Men, but such was the pervasive attitude of the era. Women were pleasure-givers, not receivers or, if pleasure was received, it was incidental. Luckily, contemporary TV writers are now centralising female pleasure in both celebratory and matter-of-fact ways.Last year, Toni Collette claimed to be the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC with Wanderlust a show that ruffled feathers with its scene involving her masturbating, screwed-up face and all, in front of her partner. We had Phoebe Waller-Bridge wanking over a Barack Obama speech on her laptop while her boyfriend sleeps in Fleabag. In Broad City, Ilana Glazer makes a meal out of masturbation with extensive ‘self-seduction’ rituals that include lighting candles, putting on lipstick and eating oysters. Bumping back to reality, Insecure saw Issa (Issa Rae) scramble round the house looking for batteries for her vibrator while, ironically, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word ‘hump’.In Gentleman Jack, though nowhere near as racy a series as one hoped, it was quite thrilling to watch Suranne Jones’ Anne Lister timing and recording her lovers’ orgasms. I remember being taken aback watching the first series of Top of the Lake, in which Robyn’s boyfriend pulls her into a pub toilet to go down on her, because it is usually the other way around. It is telling that all these shows have female writers or directors.All these instances carry a little revolutionary spark because it has always seemed that when women come on-screen (if indeed they do) it is a quick, smooth and penis-centric affair involving penetration. This does not reflect most women’s realities. (At least two-thirds of women having heterosexual sex cannot come this way fingers, tongues and vibrators are much more effective.) We need to do more to educate young people about female pleasure. Jess Phillips was absolutely right when she said it was vital to discuss female pleasure in compulsory sex education to break down the culture of power imbalance between men and women. Heterosexual women orgasm less with a partner than any other demographic.The reasons for this orgasm gap are multifaceted. It is not down to biology, rather any combination of lack of anatomical knowledge, the indifference of a partner, not feeling safe enough to ‘let go’ or confident enough to self-advocate. Much of our confidence in sex will come from experimenting privately and, hopefully, being with a partner who wants to learn the language. We need to encourage this through awareness from a young age. As Phillips has said, we’re not teaching kids to masturbate – we’re talking to them about what they’re already doing.As of next year, the Department of Education is reforming sex education lessons for the first time in 17 years. Thank the lord. So much of the shame we carry as adults stems from what we experience when we’re pubescent. My mind would have exploded if I’d seen something as bold and right-on as Big Mouth at 14. If I were making the rules, I’d make watching this episode a compulsory part of the curriculum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8127230172bca03df01edc9f6a3de2d26e805003/144_0_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae7e9cd34feac8e9c0b944a21f8970a","title":"mission to the unknown lost doctor who episode remade for youtube generation daleks","story":"Mission to the Unknown, a mythical episode about the evil Dalek army that has not been seen since 1965, has now landed online for today’s fansThe Daleks are back! In black and white, and on YouTube! The metal monsters are once again menacing secret service agents from Earth on the planet Kembel, in a recreation of a Doctor Who adventure not seen since 1965.Using the original script, replica props, vintage TV methods and the contemporary voice of the Daleks, Nicholas Briggs, the missing episode Mission to the Unknown has been remade by film and media students at the University of Central Lancashire. The recreation premiered on the official BBC Doctor Who YouTube channel at 5:50pm on 9 October, exactly 54 years after the story was broadcast for the one and only time.It is unique in the original Doctor Who series for being the only episode not to feature the Tardis, Doctor or any of his companions. Instead, it was a standalone story starring arch-enemies the Daleks, which acted as a prequel to a later 12-part adventure The Daleks’ Master Plan (and quite possibly, in the mind of Dalek creator Terry Nation, as a pilot for a Dalek spinoff series that never materialised.)Would a Dalek spinoff have worked in 1965? On this evidence, yes.The episode sets up a galactic war between humans and Daleks, and an undercover security force sent from Earth to thwart them. It introduces an alliance of alien races, who are determined to invade the solar system alongside the Daleks. You can easily imagine a multitude of further stories set in this universe.It is probably the only Doctor Who episode that could be completely remade convincingly in this way. The lack of regular cast involvement means there’s nobody trying to imitate William Hartnell as the Doctor, and the characters of Marc Cory and Gordon Lowery (played by Marco Simioni and Dan Gilligan) get to establish themselves on their own basis over the 25 minutes.Inevitably, given the source material, it is a bit stilted, stagey and even slapstick at points. But the recreation of the Daleks, and the way they are shot in stark black-and-white, is effective. The Kembel jungle and the dangerous Varga plants look comparable to 60s Doctor Who sets, and the Dalek death ray effect is true to the source. The storyline is quite slight, though, making this an interesting curiosity rather than a ‘must see’.It says something about the mythical status of the missing Doctor Who episodes that what is essentially a student project has ended up getting a run-out on the BBC’s official YouTube channel. There are still 97 episodes of 60s Doctor Who missing. They occasionally turn up, most recently in October 2013. However, Mission to the Unknown was never sold overseas, meaning there is virtually zero chance of it ever being found.The production took five days in February 2019, and former Blue Peter presenter Peter Purves, who played the Doctor’s companion Steven in 1965, visited the set, saying: “This is an absolutely wonderful project. I can remember at the time that Bill Hartnell and I were a bit miffed not to be included in any way at all … but it was a nice week off in the end!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56bb2b973f515de9b7b650023c7c261d53b4db28/247_85_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4010d72689172f42cf22fa1d53759709","title":"alexandria ocasio cortezs hair salon visit","story":"Congresswoman targeted with report she spent nearly $300 at salon, a sum many pointed out as a pretty good dealThere is a lot that offends about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: her Green New Deal, her socialism, her dancing, her previous employment as a bar-tender, and now, apparently, her hair.The Democrat congresswoman was the subject of an exclusive news story from the Washington Times on Wednesday, in which the newspaper reported she had spent nearly $300 on having her hair cut and coloured.“The self-declared socialist, who regularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway, spent nearly $300 on her hairdo at a pricey salon she frequents in downtown Washington, The Washington Times has learned,” the article began.The paper quoted Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, who described Ocasio-Cortez as “the Eva Peron of American politics. She preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged.”But women on Twitter defended the Congresswoman, saying the ones who should be checking their privilege in the haircare wars were men, who clearly had no idea how much women were routinely charged for haircuts and colour treatments.“Sorry, you don’t get to create beauty standards that require women to spend hundreds or thousands a year to be considered presentable and then hate us for it,” tweeted the writer Jessica Valenti.Others drew attention to the article’s assertion that Ocasio-Cortez “could have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop”.“Her high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,” the article said.“At that place, open to members of Congress and the public, a men’s cut runs about $20, though men’s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women’s,” the article acknowledges.Defence reporter Katie Bo Williams pointed out the irony that the paper was incensed that Ocasio-Cortez, whom the article calls a “self-declared socialist” had paid a business for a haircut, rather than get a government-subsidised one at the salon recommended by the article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d30517e191bfe13e0cad8bc683d8c85fcee7d85/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765a1d9a68e32194461109ccd1c9c85b","title":"homemade invisible ink earns ninja student an a for half an essay","story":"Professor was so impressed with Eimi Haga’s creativity, he didn’t reveal whole textA Japanese student aced an assignment on ninja culture by making her own invisible ink from soya beans in a stealthy move that impressed her professor.Eimi Haga, a member of Mie University’s ninja club, submitted an essay about the assassins with a message attached instructing the professor to heat it before reading.“I knew that I needed to take it home and put it above a stove,” said Yuji Yamada, who teaches Japanese history, including ninja culture. “She replicated what is written in records of ninja art. She strived to prove what was written actually works and went through a trial-and-error process. I was impressed.”When the characters of Haga’s essay revealed themselves in the heat, Yamada – who had promised his students extra marks for creativity – decided to award her an A.Haga, 19, made the ink by soaking soya beans overnight and then squeezing them into a paste. She said she had tested three different kinds of paper for the optimum effect.“If the paper is too thin, it burns when heated. If it’s too thick, it doesn’t absorb the ink very well,” she said. “I usually use pens and PC to write things. It’s been a while since I took a brush to write with an invisible ink.”Yamada said reports filed as scrolls or folded into throwing stars were the most creative he had seen from students until now. “We discussed the use of invisible ink but I was amazed that someone actually used it,” he said, adding that he didn’t read the entire paper because he wanted to keep some of Haga’s work invisible.“By learning about ninja … we can apply their knowledge and ways to modern society,” Yamada said.Ninjas were agents revered for their ability to combine stealth and violence in the service of their samurai masters during the “warring states” period in Japan from the mid-15th century."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Delil SouleimanAFPGettyA Kurdish man living in Ireland has said his elderly father has packed his bags and is planning to leave his home in northern Syria after Turkey began its military incursion into the region on Wednesday.Turkish ground troops crossed the border into northeast Syria last night following hours of heavy shelling of border towns. The offensive began after US President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of the approximately 1,000 American troops stationed in the region, following a phonecall with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Ahmad Bekkî, originally from Kobanî, northern Syria has been living in Ireland for over ten years with his wife and their children.“My dad is 85 years of age. Last night, until 1am, he was packing his luggage. He has all his luggage and baggage in front of the main door and he doesn’t know when he’s going to head out of the city,” he said.“My two brothers already left. They saw the smoke and the dark clouds in the sky of city so they have to leave. My dad is an old man and he doesn’t want to leave until right up until the last moment.“Everyone is certain that a genocide is going to happen by Turkish troops. Turkish troops invaded part of northern Syria before, a city that was 99 per cent Kurds. They took their properties, put them in jails, abused them. We know this is going to happen.”Mr Bekkî said members of the Kurdish community in Ireland remain “positive” and is keeping in contact with family members in northern Syria.“Most of them are positive. Our history, especially in the last century, we have faced many, many massacres. We’ve been in this situation, we’ve got used to it. We’ve been treated badly, we knew that Mr Trump would withdraw. We knew this time was going to come.”Announcing the operation, code-named Peace Spring, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey’s mission was to “prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area”.Mr Erdogan, who spoke by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin before the invasion, wants to establish what he terms a “safe zone” along Syria’s border with Turkey.It is expected the Turkish military may ultimately lay siege to the border towns of Kobanî, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.Read full coverage of events here"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Nicola Sturgeon praises \u0026#39excellent\u0026#39 Lord Provost who spent £8,000 of public money on clothes and shoesJeremy Corbyn refuses to commit to immediate election if Boris Johnson secures Brexit extensionArmy sergeant demoted after he punched and twisted the nipples of \u0026#39raw recruits\u0026#39 to toughen them up, tribunal hears  Flight delayed as Extinction Rebellion activist boards London City Airport planeWhat do Extinction Rebellion want from their protests - and where in London are they taking place?Spice epidemic in jails exposed as prisoner dies after setting himself on fire while high on drugInside al-Hol, the \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 Isil prison camp where radicalised women have taken controlDenmark to impose controls at Swedish border amid crime waveEngland \u0026#39may well end up with mandatory vaccines\u0026#39 says top doctorAustralian state proposes two-year prison sentence for possession of Extinction Rebellion \u0026#39human lock\u0026#39Turkey\u0026#39s Erdogan threatens to send \u0026#39millions\u0026#39 of refugees to Europe if EU calls Syria offensive \u0026#39invasion\u0026#39Police pay damages to family of gangster Mark DugganObesity among 10 year-olds hits record high: find out how your area ranksDonald Trump\u0026#39s secret briefing notes reveal Anne Sacoolas \u0026#39will not return to UK\u0026#39British Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 moved from Kurdish to US custody says TrumpPrince Harry and Ed Sheeran in \u0026#39gingers unite\u0026#39 video for World Mental Health DayComment: How my rescue kitten rescued me from the anxiety blues\tGambling addiction may be genetic, according to pioneering UK study Thursday morning news briefing: Reaching the end of the Brexit deal roadGerman shooter\u0026#39s plan to encourage copycats foiled as home-made guns jam repeatedly We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/08/22/TELEMMGLPICT000185835396_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"have laboured find brexit middle ground eu never serious compromise","story":"A disused customs office at Newry on the Northern Ireland borderOver the last few months, the Prosperity UK Alternative Arrangements Commission has taken the words of the EU President, Donald Tusk, in April very seriously. “Please do not waste this time,” he said when the EU granted the extension to October 31.We have devised and developed Alternative Arrangements for the Irish border, as envisaged in both the original Withdrawal Agreement, the Strasbourg Declaration and the Brady Amendment, which passed the House of Commons in January with a majority of 16.

Of the 79p\u0026nbsppaid by shoppers for a\u0026nbsp100g\u0026nbsppack of black Assam tea in the UK, 49p goes to supermarkets and tea brands, 27p\u0026nbspto other firms such as packaging providers, while tea pickers collectively receive 3p. If workers on tea estates in Assam received just 5p\u0026nbspmore of the retail price, they could be paid a living wage of 330 rupees (£3.80) per day.Aldi, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco confirmed to Oxfam that they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited in Assam.As for the fruit farms in Brazil, Lidl and\u0026nbspSainsbury’s confirmed they source produce from the farms, either directly or through importers, while Tesco and Morrisons said they\u0026nbsppreviously did so.When contacted by Oxfam, Asda owner Walmart\u0026nbspdeclined to say whether it has links to the tea estates or the fruit farms.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”Sainsbury’s declined to comment, pointing instead to a statement issued by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on behalf of its members.\u0026nbsp“Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue,” said\u0026nbspPeter Andrews, head of sustainability at the BRC.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership, committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions. But we know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.”According to Oxfam, Tesco is doing most to protect human rights in its supply chain, although all six supermarkets still have a long way to go.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

The trick that Rooney says she used to find out who had been passing on information from her private posts\u0026nbsprelies on a feature specific to Instagram stories, and not found on most other social platforms. When navigating through posts, you are not simply looking at the pictures and videos people shared – they\u0027re also looking at you, looking at their posts.Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking her stories to The SunWhen someone posts an Instagram story, they can see a full list of the accounts that have viewed that story. Since it is not possible to look at stories unless a user is logged in, there is no way to see any post without being logged in.What\u0027s more, those stories can be locked down, ensuring that only specific people can see them. If an account is private – as Rooney says hers was – then someone has to request to follow it that means that only approved people can see stories or feed posts on a private account.Once someone is following an account – whether\u0026nbspit is private or public – people can also be blocked from seeing posts on a story. That means that people must be approved and also not blocked to see a post, which can be used to give very precise\u0026nbspcontrol over who is looking at Instagram stories.Rooney says she used this feature to find out who had been taking information from her posts. She says that she uploaded stories but restricted them so that they could only be seen by one specific account – Vardy\u0027s, she claims – allowing her to know where any information had come from.What\u0027s more, despite the fact that Instagram is unusually transparent about who has been interacting with stories, it importantly does not tell people who else has been viewing a story. That means there is no way to know if you are the only person who has seen a specific post, and therefore no way to know if only you know certain information.In short, there are three particular features of Instagram that make such a claim possible. It allows you to shut down your account so that only approved people can see it it lets you see who viewed your stories\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspyou can block specific people from doing so.When combined, those three settings can be used as a powerful trick to allow people to see information without knowing that only they are seeing it.It is rare that this\u0026nbspwill be used to work out who is passing on personal information to newspapers. But it could expose people in a variety of other, more pedestrian ways – and do so without the person using it even knowing.Similar features do exist on other platforms. Snapchat, which had the stories features before Instagram, also allows people to see who has been looking at their stories, and even when someone screengrabs one LinkedIn informs users when somebody has been looking at their profile.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With the release of iOS 13 and Android 10, both platforms support system-wide dark mode.Those dark modes turn the phone\u0027s menus, notifications and other parts of the system black. But they also signal to apps that they can turn dark if they wish, too, and gives them the option of reflecting the system\u0027s look.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  Instagram had been particularly slow among the bigger apps to update to reflect that change. That meant that users could often find themselves hit by the glare of the app after navigating around other apps that had already adopted the darker look.The trick Coleen Rooney used to accuse Rebekah Vardy, explainedThe rollout was confirmed by Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who reminded users that they need to be on the latest version of their iPhone or Android operating system to be able to use it.Starting today, you can use Instagram in dark mode on iOS 13 or Android 10, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspTurn dark mode on your phone to try it out.As Mr\u0026nbspMosseri\u0027s message suggests, there seems to be no way to turn on the dark mode on a per-app basis, so that it is only switched on for Instagram and not other apps. Instead, it seems to only be able to take its lead from the operating system, and whether dark mode is switched on for the whole phone.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace)Presumably hired because fellow “foreign, unconvincing muscle-man” Dolph Lundgren wasn’t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man – a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming – doesn’t help matters. (AW)334 32. Cara Delevingne as EnchantressJune Moone (Suicide Squad)It’s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC)434 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman)The one area of Wonder Woman we don’t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film’s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others – namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW)534 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman)It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman’s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW)634 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl)The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good – it’s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW)734 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns)A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it\u0027s an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW)834 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman)About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman\u0027s recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW)934 26. Liam Neeson as Ra\u0027s al Ghul (Batman Begins)Ra\u0027s al Ghul, or The Demon\u0027s Head in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. “It was quite a good argument he comes up with,” the actor said. Terrifying. (EH)1034 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn\u0027t so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman \u0026amp Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he\u0027s absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW)1134 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman)Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It\u0027s a very minor victory, though. (AW)1234 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad)It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger’s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, if it weren’t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn’t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO)1334 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises)Although many will purely remember Cotillard’s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman’s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH)1434 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel)The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder’s film. He’s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn’t have helped. (AW)1534 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises)1634 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966)Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin’s dastardly villainy. But it’s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW)1734 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman)The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero’s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC)1834 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns)One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it\u0027s such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it\u0027s not remotely a problem. (AW)1934 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker)The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it’s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that’s not the best of experiences. (AW)2034 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises)Catwoman – the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman – was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer’s turn in the Nineties. (EH)2134 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966)The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West’s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC)2234 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966)It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh – a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He’s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn’t be bothered to shave it off, there’s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW)2334 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman \u0026amp Robin)Batman \u0026amp Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW)2434 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever)Released at the peak of Carrey’s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn’t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey – squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW)2534 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966)Gorshin’s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It’s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman’s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW)2634 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever)“I will not sanction your buffoonery,” Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones\u0027s famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn\u0027t visible on screen. He\u0027s fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW)2734 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins)Cillian Murphy didn’t get the screentime he needed – or deserved – to really develop what could have been one of DC’s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance Scarecrow didn’t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO)2834 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns)The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck\u0027s capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It\u0027s no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it\u0027s also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW)2934 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight)Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film\u0027s secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW)3034 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns)3134 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)134 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League)We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill’s computer generated upper lip that it’s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW)234 33.

Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II)A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve’s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he’s a blast. (AW)3234 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman)The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson’s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying – not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It’s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW)3334 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight)The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale’s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It’s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO)3434 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns)The mystery over Catwoman\u0027s moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening inidual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can\u0027t help but pail in comparison. (AW)Leto is also notably absent from the\u0026nbspupcoming Suicide Squad sequel, also. When making the original film, Leto reportedly sent\u0026nbspa dead pig to the first table read.Phoenix recently said he would be very interested in playing Joker again, following rave reviews of his performance in the film and its success at the box office.Joker is out now in\u0026nbspcinemas.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema,” he said.“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.“It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”Created with Sketch.Best films of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab341 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1641 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”The brilliance of the new film lies in the surefooted way it caters both for children too young to have seen its predecessors and for adults who’ve grown up (or grown older) watching the previous instalments. It takes some kind of genius for the Pixar animators to give such a searing emotional charge to a story in which one of the main characters is a single use plastic spork retrieved from the trash.Perhaps The Flood isn’t quite the urgent, profound film a crisis of this scale deserves, but in a culture where refugees are so rarely shown any empathy in mainstream media, maybe this is the film we need right now.Ari Aster\u0027s follow-up to Hereditary serves up much of the same: it’s a break-up movie wrapped up in pagan horror. It’s also bound to be one of this year’s most memorable films, proving that Aster is far from a one-hit wonder.The Lion King is undoubtedly a technological marvel that, much like Avatar, will come to be viewed as a milestone in special effects history, yet it’s just as interesting to see how all this innovation has been employed.3241 Varda by Agnès  For a film that’s almost entirely narrated by Agnès Varda\u0027s own voice, it doesn’t feel driven by ego, but by pure intellectual and emotional curiosity.Animals treats its subjects with patience and generosity. You’ll find no life lessons here. Its main characters are free to pursue their desires, to whatever end.3441 Blinded by the LightBlinded by the Light offers not only a reminder of Springsteen’s lyrical genius, but of how he’s always served as a beacon for the disenfranchised.Lined up against some of this year’s other more heartfelt offerings, including Booksmart, Good Boys offers further proof that putting a little humanity in our comedy always gets the best results. Hustlers is an electrifying response to the deluge of stories we’ve had over the years about very rich, very bad dudes. Finally, we can turn the tables on every film that’s used women, specifically strippers, as decorative accessories to drape over businessmen as they conduct their illicit backroom meetings. Or, failing that, to shake their out-of-focus tits in the background of a shot.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It’s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors.The real drama here is not whether or not apocalypse can be avoided but whether Brad Pitt’s character can reconcile himself with his father and overcome his own extreme emotional repression. In other words, in spite of all the jargon and the hardware, this is an intimate family melodrama at heart. Thanks to Pitt’s performance and Gray’s delicate direction, it turns into a very moving one.Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it’s one of the best films of the year.This is Renée Zellweger’s Judy. It doesn’t belong to Rupert Goold, its director. Nor does it belong to Tom Edge, its screenwriter. It’s a performance of such overwhelming force that it wrests authorship from every other hand that guided the film’s creation.4141 Ready or NotAs absurd and self-indulgent as Ready or Not can get, it doesn’t mess around with its social commentary. The class system is the game we never asked to play, don’t get a fair chance at, and have no hope of winning. It’s a timeless metaphor.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move.

Anything soccer-related is a tough sell in the United States, but you never know: What we lack in appreciation for soccer we tend to make up for in appreciation for drama,” Ms\u0026nbspSchwedel\u0026nbspconcluded.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s got it all”, the newspaper said.Rooney’s investigative skills also received coverage as far afield as\u0026nbspAustralia,\u0026nbspNorway\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspIndia.Even\u0026nbspGermany’s biggest newspaper,\u0026nbspBild, thought it was worth covering and described the event as a “thriller in England”.Everything you need to know about Coleen Rooney and Rebekah VardyIts story came with a stark headline: “Rooney wife convicts\u0026nbspVardy\u0026nbspwoman as a traitor”.The Sun\u0026nbsphas declined to comment on Rooney’s allegations and a source has been quoted saying the newspaper does not comment on its sources.However, it did run an exclusive story today which claimed that a “sobbing”\u0026nbspVardy\u0026nbspbegged Rooney to believe her in a “panicked phone call”.A representative for Rooney has insisted it is “irrefutable” that the leaked information “came from one account, and one account only”.Agencies contributed to this reportShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Her novels are written in Polish and translated into English by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and Jennifer Croft.She caused outrage among right-wing Polish patriots after commenting that Poland, which likes to depict itself as a plucky survivor of oppression through history, had itself committed “horrendous acts” of colonisation. For a time she was given bodyguards by her publisher as protection, after being branded a “targowiczanin” – an ancient Polish term\u0026nbspfor “traitor” – by her detractors.Handke, who has been producing a number of works in varying genres for more than 50 years,\u0026nbspwas honoured “for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspexplored the periphery and the specificity of human experience”.Explaining its decision, the Nobel Prize said that Tokarczuk “never views reality as something stable or everlasting. She constructs her novels in a tension between cultural opposites nature versus culture, reason versus madness, male versus female, home versus alienation.”Of Handke,\u0026nbspthe academy said: “The peculiar art of Peter Handke, awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature, is the extraordinary attention to landscapes and the material presence of the world, which has made cinema and painting two of his greatest sources of inspiration.”Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker.

Of the 79p\u0026nbsppaid by shoppers for a\u0026nbsp100g\u0026nbsppack of black Assam tea in the UK, 49p goes to supermarkets and tea brands, 27p\u0026nbspto other firms such as packaging providers, while tea pickers collectively receive 3p. If workers on tea estates in Assam received just 5p\u0026nbspmore of the retail price, they could be paid a living wage of 330 rupees (£3.80) per day.Aldi, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco confirmed to Oxfam that they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited in Assam.As for the fruit farms in Brazil, Lidl and\u0026nbspSainsbury’s confirmed they source produce from the farms, either directly or through importers, while Tesco and Morrisons said they\u0026nbsppreviously did so.When contacted by Oxfam, Asda owner Walmart\u0026nbspdeclined to say whether it has links to the tea estates or the fruit farms.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than a third said they are not able to take a toilet break or have a drink of water when they needed it.The Independent\u0026nbspasked Aldi,\u0026nbspLidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco for a comment on the findings.A spokesperson for\u0026nbspAldi\u0026nbspsaid: “We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected. We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”Sainsbury’s declined to comment, pointing instead to a statement issued by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) on behalf of its members.\u0026nbsp“Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue,” said\u0026nbspPeter Andrews, head of sustainability at the BRC.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership, committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions. But we know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.”According to Oxfam, Tesco is doing most to protect human rights in its supply chain, although all six supermarkets still have a long way to go.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

among EU nationals after appearing to suggest\u0026nbspthousands of people without settled status\u0026nbspcould be deported after Brexit.Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said European citizens living in the UK risked being sent home if they fail to apply for permanent residence\u0026nbspby the end of 2020.Asked whether people face deportation despite fulfilling all legal conditions for a residence permit, Mr Lewis said: “Theoretically, yes.\u0026nbspWe will apply the applicable rules.”Campaigners seized on his comments as a sign that EU citizens will “face the full force of the hostile environment”.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson

Instead of these threats, the government should enshrine people’s rights to stay in law so they are protected and not put at risk by failings in a bureaucratic process –\u0026nbspas the Home Affairs Committee has recommended.“It is clear that the government have not learned the lessons from the Windrush scandal, which showed how easily iniduals can fall through gaps in the system through no fault of their own, and how easily lives can be destroyed if the government gets this wrong.”Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson,\u0026nbspsaid it was clear that Boris Johnson had no intention of automatically guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens.She said:\u0026nbsp“No one seriously believes the Home Office will have granted settled status to all 3.6 million EU citizens by the Conservatives’ arbitrary December 2020 deadline. “Thousands will inevitably be left effectively undocumented –\u0026nbspand now the government is saying it will deport them.\u0026nbspThat is totally unacceptable.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.“The EU settlement scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need.“We have received 2 million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.“We’ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they’ll be given a further opportunity to apply.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But with the prospects of a deal looking slim, The Independent has been told the recall will now be staged “either way”.“We are in uncharted waters because only God knows what Boris is up to,” said the MP. “Whatever people had been discussing, they are not discussing it in the same context any more because of this move by No 10.”Plotters are wary of giving Downing Street too much notice of their plans, or of striking before a majority is assured, said the MP: “A lot of people are looking for ways to try to get the option of a second referendum onto the table, but we want to make sure we avoid the danger of it not being carried.”Even if passed, any referendum motion would come up against a series of obstacles, including the fact that it would require a money resolution to authorise the substantial spending involved, which can only be tabled by a minister.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Southern states voted to form the Confederacy\u0026nbspin Montgomery in 1861 and the city served as the unofficial republic\u0027s first capital.Last year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened a memorial and museum in Montgomery’s city centre to honour victims of lynching in the racially segregated era after the US Civil War.The city was the site of the pivotal bus boycott, a year-long civil rights protest sparked by black seamstress Rosa Parks, who was famously jailed after refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger as required by law in 1955.The US Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to end racial segregation on its buses, and Martin Luther King Jr, one of the boycott’s leaders, went on to emerge as one of the most prominent leaders of the American civil rights movement.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We call on the Untied States to fulfil her promises to stop this aggression.Turkey views the\u0026nbspSDF\u0026nbspas terrorists and potential allies of Kurdish separatists in Turkey. The\u0026nbspSDF\u0026nbspsays Turkey is trying to ethnically cleanse areas of Kurds and change its demographics.She continued: If we didn\u0027t fight against Daesh, this terrorist organisation, then the whole international community would be in danger. There are still some sleeper cells of Daesh in Syria and they are ready to wake up again. The SDF fight war against Daesh is still going on.François Alfonsi, a French MEP from the GreensEuropean Free Alliance told reporters: This is an act of great seriousness and Europe must respond\u0026nbsp to it, so the those who are responsible become the military and political losers.Julie Ward, a Labour MEP, added: We cannot abandon the Kurdish people, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s so important that we are having this press conference here today.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She was reportedly later sacked following a row with Robinson.Many women recruited by far-right groups are tempted by the flattering, sometimes obsessive, remarks they will undoubtedly receive from men, and the opportunities for promotion.Women usually climb up the rungs [of groups] really quickly, explains Julia. They get a lot of attention from the male fan base and are almost fetishised... that can be an incentive.Former neo-Nazi Elisa Hategan says joining such groups can be a massive ego boost - as there are usually far more men than women and all the guys want to date you. Elisa was just  when she was recruited into the notorious white supremacist group, the Heritage Front in Canada - and was soon thrust into the limelight as its softer, female face. During her time in the organisation - which disbanded around  - Elisa was taught how to fire a gun, ordered to terrorise anti-racist activists, and even told how to dress and act.[I was told] to dress more provocatively, she recalls.To wear my hair down and keep it long. To flirt with potential recruits in order to get donations.She adds: I’d say there was probably a -to- ratio [of men to women].Canadian far-right activist Lauren, the daughter of a secretary and a web designer, rose to fame around four years ago working for the countrys far-right political website The Rebel Media.Her first video - a verbal attack on feminism  - was an overnight hit.Since then, the -year-old has become a far-right icon internationally, including in Britain, known for blasting Islam and immigration, holding a sign reading “there is no rape culture in the West at a Slutwalk protest, and dubbing Black Lives Matter an ethnic terrorist organisation.Last year, she was even banned from the UK, after handing out leaflets saying Allah is gay and Allah is trans in Luton, Bedfordshire - yet denies being racist or far right.On Instagram, pictures of Lauren smiling in low-cut tops, stroking animals and visiting churches, mountains and cities across the world are interspersed with more sinister snaps.In one, she performs the OK hand sign - which was last month added to a list of hate symbols alongside the swastika. In another, she drinks from a mug reading: Feminism is cancer.But despite Laurens extremist views, some women long to be her.Commenting on an Instagram snap of Lauren in a fitted black dress, one girl told her, You are my role model, someday o wish to be like you, a strong, beautul, smarrrttt. Human being .Another tweeted: You inspired me to get into politics.Lauren, who recently retired from the public political sphere, strokes a dogAnd the same goes for hipster-looking Brittany Sellner  - another far-right activist who peddles right-wing conspiracy theories on YouTube and has also been barred from entering Britain.Brittany - one of Laurens pals, who also denies being an extremist - previously co-hosted an alt-right interview vlog, dedicated to the traditional values that once made Western Civilization great, including... traditional gender roles and love of one’s own culture, race and country.She also runs her own YouTube channel, where she peppers controversial videos with titles like You can no longer criticise illegal immigration with millennial-style vlogs, including one on dating.In a recent anti-feminism clip, named The War On Men, Brittany tells her , subscribers there is a hostile narrative surrounding men that has escalated over the past few years.Brittany, dubbed a white power Barbie, has previously spread the sick lie that Hillary Clinton was part of a paedophile ring and that white people are being systematically eradicated by migrants.She has also been accused of supporting anti-Muslim and anti-migrant views.Yet her , Instagram followers love her. Posting under a snap of the American influencer kissing her husband Martin Sellner, , one wrote: The West needs more people like you two. Martin is an Austrian former neo-Nazi, perhaps best known for leading a stunt where he and his supporters tried to sink rescue ships picking up refugees crossing the Mediterranean.He is also a leader of Generation Identity- Europes largest youth-focused, far-right group which anti-racism campaigners say calls for the segregation of people along racial lines.Two years ago, Julia went undercover with GIs UK branch. And she tells us she was quickly eyed up to become its public face - a decision she believes was largely based on the fact shes female.They were actively trying to recruit young women, she claims.The group initially considered asking Tommy Robinson to be their figurehead, according to Julia, originally from Austria and author of The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far-Right Extremism.But they were concerned that he wastoo old.For Sellner and other key GI players, how their members appear to others is vital.Today, Ben Jones, leader of the UK branch - which spews out propaganda with protests and events - claims it is now known as the Identitarian Movement and is independent of GI groups where.The -year-old tells Sun Online women make up around  per cent of his groups current activists - but admits: Most of that has come about in the past six months.However, he denies specically targeting females: We dont target any demographic except students.Yet one woman in the group - a -year-old called Alice - admits that she and other female members often share ideas about how we can attract more like-minded women to join.Wed love to see our numbers continue to expand, she says, adding that being active on social media is certainly something that the group supports and encourages among our members.Another member Sarah, , tells us social media is a great  to talk with others who believe in the same things you do and also talk to others who dont.Today, former neo-Nazi Elisa believes there are more far right female role models than ever before.Because of the internet, alt-right women such as Lauren, Brittany and others have gained a prominent voice, says the -year-old, from Toronto, who left the Heritage Front aged  and is now director of the charity The Changemaker Project, helping those at risk of radicalisation.The message is that women can be successful in peddling hate.Elisa, seen at another Heritage Front rally, was told to wear her hair down and keep it longAnd as other online profiles crop up of pretty, young far-right women posing like catwalk models and Instagram stars, its likely that they will only continue to lure in girls.There is a much greater awareness that the medium is the message, Elisa says.Andyou want the message to be palatable, the messenger has to be equally disarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating. Even at the age of .Just don’t ask me to name safari’s “big five”, ’cos I’ve watched that episode three times now and my best guess is still lion, rhino, elephant, The Gruffalo and Thomas Skinner, the hulking great Charley Boorman lookalike from Romford, whose nose twitches uncontrollably whenever he’s just said something wrong.“Look, we ain’t a bunch of idiots, are we ” .Thomas, of course, was one of the stand-out performers on a brilliant first episode, along with Ryan-Mark Parsons , Carina Lepore, whose tour of the vineyard sculpture park was a bit wordy for my likingand Lottie Lion, who “worked in the best wine bar in the UK”, and is as fragrant and enticing as a broken bottle of Buckfast.It bodes well for the series, but almost certainly won’t stop the usual axe-grinders complaining “The Apprentice is past its sell-by-date”, even though there are other network fixtures and fittings that fit that description so much better.Andyou want a full and exhaustive list of all those BBC shows which deserve to be sent to the knacker’s yard long before Lord Sugar’s masterpiece, here goes. All of them.BBC, Wednesday, pm, The Apprentice. It does what it says on the tin, yeah.JUST a quick note about the incredibly intense two-minute, -second silence Eamonn Holmes maintained while he stared at the Greek Feast Phil Vickery was making on Friday’s This Morning.Who said the following last week: “There’s bile coming out of her and all this green crap ”A Cat discussing Morag’s stomach upset on Treasure Island with Bear Grylls B Emily Maitlis introducing Greta Thunberg on Newsnight Well I didn’t say it was hard, did I Channel  over-stepping the anti-Boris anti-Brexit line on Friday’s Gogglebox.The BBC appointing the host of Michael Jackson: The Live Seance, June Sarpong, as its new head of “Creative Diversity”.Sky Atlantic expecting us all to pretend Helen Mirren isn’t  years too old to be playing Catherine The Great.Sean Bean’s bus that never bloody moves on World On Fire.And The One Show’s Matt Baker asking: “Comedy, where did that all start, Romesh ”When, Matt. Not where. When does that all start Paul Merson: “This lad’s come in and not let them down once. Although he let them down at Old Trafford.”RICHARD Madeley has left The Circle and, given the impact he had on the Channel  reality show, it would have been understandableall the interest had gone with him. The fact it hasn’t is largely down to the discovery of a brand new television star.He’s Tim, the show’s -year-old theology professor, who, unlike all the millennials in that building hiding their insecurities behind a wall of tattoos and fake identities, is so comfortable in his own skin he works out in the gym wearing a three- piece, while reading a book.It’s an approach that can trip him up, quite literally, on the running machine. No one, least of all the other contestants, should mistake the most sweet-natured man on telly for a fool, though.He has sussed out almost everyone  on The Circle, including catfish Katie Jay, and knows exactly how they will react to his messages before he’s even sent them.I wouldn’t normally advocate a post-reality show career for any of these fame-chasers. But it’s a performance of such charm and wit that Tim deserves the ultimate Channel  accolade. Dictionary Corner.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

She also wants new taxes on junk foods, or plain packagingthey are not made healthier by . Other recommendations include:Her thirst for taxing things is only exceeded by her thirst for bans.We can only hope that her successor focuses on serious public health issues, such as tackling the growing measles epidemic, rather than regulating the size of pizzas.Dame Sally has also told ministers to ban eating and drinking, apart from water, on buses and trains to discourage snacking. She said it leads to “mindless consumption” and triggers others to scoff more.Critics accused her of championing the “silliest extremes of the nanny state”.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour. You have stayed loyal to democracy, voting in the European elections we were never meant to have.Opinion polls suggest that Euroscepticism is only growing, with more now wanting a No-Deal Brexit than not.You have, in short, shown the poise and maturity we once expected from our political masters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email EU citizens who do not apply for settled status to remain in the UK after Brexit could face being deported, a government minister has confirmed. Those who havenapost applied by the deadline without a good reason, could find themselves facing immigration enforcement rules, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis told German newspaper Die Welt .But statistics published yesterday suggested that just  in  EU citizens in the UK have applied for the scheme. The deadline for European citizens to apply for settled status is  June , or  December the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Speaking to Die Welt Mr Lewis said that EU citizens who have not registered by that date without a good reason will be subject to normal immigration rules - meaning they could be detained and ultimately deported. But Mr Lewis stressed that people had time to apply and the government didnapost want to see any EU citizen who wanted to remain end up in the postion.    He added that the rights of EU citizens would not be immediately affected by a no-deal exit. EU citizens resident in the UK, and their family members, are eligible for settled status   before December  they have been living in the UK continuously for five years. People resident for less time will be granted pre-settled status until they hit the five year residency requirement. When applying for the scheme, EU citizens will be required to declare convictions that appear in their criminal record in the UK or overseas - in addition to proving their ID and residency. Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary warned that the governmentaposs approach could lead to another Windrush. She said: “Threats by ministers that EU nationals could be deported are a complete breach of all the assurances that the government has made.  This will be deeply troubling to people who have come here in good faith and who contribute so much to our society. “Many of us have warned that the government’s approach could lead to another scandal like Windrush.  This Tory government seems determined to prove our worst fears correct - once again showing you can’t trust this government.” Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine also hit out at Mr Lewisapos comments.   Ms Jardine: “I am absolutely appalled.I have just been at a school where a Hungarian-born pupil told me she was scared about Brexit, and now I learn that the Conservative Government is threatening to deport people like her. “No one seriously believes the Home Office will have granted Settled Status to all . million EU citizens by the Conservatives’ arbitrary December  deadline. Thousands will inevitably be left effectively undocumented – and now the Government is saying it will deport them. Mr Lewis later took to Twitter to say his word had somewhat been taken out of context, but didnapost rule out deportations.He tweeted: My words are somewhat taken out of context.EU Citizens have till at least Dec   there’s plenty of help available to apply.We’ve now had  million applications  we’ve always said we’ll allow time for those with reasonable grounds for missing the deadline. A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends, family and neighbours and we want them to stay.“The EU Settlement Scheme is a free and easy way for EU citizens to get the UK immigration status they need. “We have received two million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December  to apply. “We’ve always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they’ll be given a further opportunity to apply.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 15 bedbound 2 years","story":"NewsBoy, , bedbound for  years after ingrown hair causes huge gaping hole in backWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Chae Ruffold, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, is now dependent on a cocktail of painkillersShareCommentsByJames SomperKelly-Ann Mills:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe schoolboy is unable to sit and stand \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

She was found as a foal, collapsed and just hours from death. Heartbreakingly, she was infested with worms, covered in lice and had diarrhoea. But since she was taken in by the RSPCA at Potters Bar in Hertfordshire Hope has made an amazing recovery. However, the five-year-old thoroughbred cross breed bay has been cared for by the charity ever since and all she wants is a home of her own.    Hope is described as: A very loving girl, she does however have a huge amount still to learn and will need someone very caring and experienced to teach her. Hope has learnt to wear a bridle and be lead in hand during her stay with us. Hope can be a little nervous when being groomed but has gained confidence. Her ideal forever home will be an owner who has dealt with young horses before. Another horse who is also desperate for a new home in four-year-old Lily. The New Forest cross breed arrived at the same centre as Hope starving and fighting for her le.  She has now made a full recovery and loves being around people. The centre describe her as: Full of character, very cheeky and incredibly intelligent. She picks up new things very quickly, including how to open gates. She is a bit of a show off and loves to strut her stuff in the field, showung off her very flashy trot. She also likes to think she is a race horse when she races our tractor up and down the field. The two horses are part of a growing number who need rescuing each month. The RSPCA rescued more than , horses from neglect and suffering last year and many of them still need new homes. And the crisis, which has been caused by the high costs of vets bills, the rising costs of hay and feed and falling demand forsome kinds of horses, is showing no sign of slowing down.  The RSPCA has three specialist equine centres - Lockwood in Surrey, Gonsal Farm in Shropshire and Felledge in County Durham, and equine rehoming facilities at Millbrook in Surrey, Southridge in Hertfordshire and Leybourne in Kent. This month is the charityaposs Adoptober and while  horses and ponies were found new homes last year, hundreds more still need to be taken on. Dr Mark Kennedy, equine welfare specialist at the RSPCA said: Many people know how rewarding rescuing a dog or cat can be, and what a fantastic range of animals come into our care looking for new homes, and we really hope horse people will see that it’s the same for horses - we have some excellent horses and ponies just waiting for a chance in a new home.

Full of indiscreet tales about his friends – made up of the most famous names on the planet – the book called Me spares no egos, most especially his own as Sir Elton details his many ­misadventures and mishaps in a brutally honest and tongue-in-cheek fashion. From his unhappy childhood in Pinner, Harrow, to becoming one of he biggest stars on the planet, then nearly losing it all, and finally after  years of fame finding family contentment with David Furnish and their two boys, it’s all there in music’s most revealing read. Here’s just a few of the revelations from the extraordinary le of Elton... Children People think it was a boy called Lev at a Ukrainian orphanage that made Elton realise he wanted to be a father. But he’s revealed his paternal instincts first appeared in South Africa in  on a visit to a Soweto drop-in centre for orphaned children living with HIV. He says: “A small boy wouldn’t sit with the other kids. He just seemed to take a shine to me. He was called Noosa. He was adorable. I realised I felt something that wasn’t pity or fondness. There was a flicker of something more  there.” He discussed adoption with partner David Furnish. In the end they found he was living happily with his grandmother and a sister.    Later that year meeting -month-old Ukrainian Lev convinced Elton he really wanted to be a dad. It proved impossible to adopt little Lev but anonymously Elton worked with a charity to get him and his brother out of an orphanage and fund their lives with their grandmother. Elton adds: “When the Russians invaded Ukraine, we worked with the same charity to evacuate them to Kiev. We’ll always keep an eye on them.” When their oldest son was born at .am on Christmas Day  that visit to Ukraine was still close their hearts. Elton says: “We called him Zachary Jackson Levon. Everybody assumes the last name came from a song Bernie and I wrote, but they’re wrong: he’s named after Lev. He had to be. “Lev was like an angel, a messenger, who taught me something about myself. Lev was the reason we were there, on a maternity ward, holding our son, knowing our lives had completely changed forever.” Princess Diana  The pair were close friends until they fell out when she withdrew support for a book raising funds for AIDs. They reunited after the mxzurder of Gianni Versace, and there is one very famous photograph of the princess consoling the red-eyed grief-stricken singer during the service. But Elton says: “She wasn’t doing anything of the sort. She was leaning past me, reaching for a mint that David offered her. The warm words of comfort coming from her lips at that exact moment were actually: ‘God, I’d love a Polo.’... ...being hrs from death Elton has revealed he was close to dying after contracting a major infection following surgery for prostrate cancer. Touring South America in  the pain became so unbearable he was forced to fly back to the UK. Taken for a scan at King Edward VII’s Hospital, London, he was told he was suffering a rare condition that left fluid leaking from his lymph nodes. And it was so serious the hospital feared it didn’t have the equipment to cope. Elton says: “I lay awake all night, wonderingI was going to die. In the hospital, alone at the dead of night, I prayed, ‘Please don’t let me die, please let me see my kids again’.” He was in intensive care for two days but after doctors drained the lymphatic fluid and gave him with antibiotics he spent seven weeks at home recuperating and learning how to walk again. Rod Stewart    The two great contemporaries have pet names for each other – Elton is nicknamed Sharon and Rod is Phyllis. Elton writes that when people joked about his hair loss Rod sent him a helmet-shaped hairdryer women used to sit under in salons. In relation Elton sent his rival back a Zimmer frame covered in fairy lights. He recounts a story of when Rod was playing Earl’s Court and the promoters advertised the gig by flying a blimp with his face over the venue. Elton says: “I called my management, who hired someone to shoot it down: Apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus.” The phone soon went. Rod was on the other end and he really did want to talk about it. “Where’s my f***ing balloon gone  It was you, wasn’t it  You cow! You bitch!’” John Lennon First Lennon was his idol, then another great friend. Elton was ­devastated at his murder in New York in . In the previous decade the pair had enjoyed drug-fuelled times. Elton relates one highlight when he and the Beatle were holed up in a hotel suite in New York working their way through a pile of cocaine and there was a knock at the door.

The -year-old has beaten her mental health demons after she was relentlessly bullied because of her height when she was at school. So Tessy is using all of her personal experiences to empower young people as head of the only charity set up in Princess Dianaaposs memory.And sheaposs getting more than a little help from Dianaaposs two beloved sons, Prince William and Prince Harry .The CEO of the Diana Award charity has spoken of how being aposplaguedapos by bullies led her to empower young people to make positive change with the help of the princes.    Tessy has opened up to the Mirror about how being six foot at the age of  led her to overcome her demons and help inspire children across the UK struggling with mental health issues. And she firmly believes that young people have the power to change the world. This is something which Tessy has embodied throughout her le. She would plead with her friends and family to find any way of being shorter when she was bullied about her height.Speaking to the Mirroraposs mental health podcast, No Really, Iaposm Fine , she has told of how volunteering at a young age helped her overcome her mental health demons.   Tessy said: It was incredibly dficult. Being a teenager was the most challenging phase of my le. It was, for me it was that sense of, what I would what I look back now and refer to as being bullied because I was too tall. I had this group of girls who kind-of always picked on me because of my height and they always said things like, aposoh youaposre too tall you wonapost be a dancerapos, aposyour legs are too longapos and I wasnapost always in sync with them. So, I chose to leave the dance group because it just made my le hell. It was at this moment that Tessyaposs parents intervened and her mother asked her to teach some children dance lessons.    This formed the foundation of what is at the core of the Diana Award today. Tessy said: I was running for four groups for dferent age groups of young people learn to dance. For a long time being tall plagued me but you know, this is where the power of a role model was so important because I remember saying to my parents, and Iaposm too tall. My parents then called a meeting and they wanted to help me find value in who I am and not about what was on the outside. They had this idea of aposwe need to help refocus herapos. They needed to help me see her values inside and not on the outside.    And what they did, which absolutely changed the trajectory of my le, was got me involved in volunteering. They got me to begin to help kids who wanted to learn how to dance. Tessy has spent almost  years empowering children to volunteer and continue positive action through the help of the Diana Award and the help of Prince Harry. Tessy said: Only a couple of months ago Prince Harry attended our mentoring summit. Heaposs very much involved in our mentoring programme around making sure young people have access to a mentor.

I could just hear this woman screaming, and then I realised it was me screaming. I felt like my heart broke. I couldnapost believe what I was hearing. I was just absolutely shocked and devastated. I couldnapost believe she had died right at the very end when there had been nothing wrong. The -year-old, who lives in Overton, Hampshire, had a completely standard pregnancy and she and husband Sam couldnapost wait to meet their beautul baby girl. Their older daughter was very excited to be a big sister, and when Roxanne went into labour on Thursday, November  last year the countdown to become a family of four was on.    Speaking to mark Baby Loss Awareness Week, Roxanne told : I was thrilled when I found out I was pregnant. I had a completely textbook pregnancy, the same as with my first daughter. It was totally uneventful. When she went for her  week appointment her bump was measuring slightly smaller than the nurse would have liked so she was sent for tests, which were all healthy and normal. Roxanne said: She was absolutely fine. She was perfect. Her heartbeat was strong and they thought she was growing fine. Roxanne went into labour at home and starting counting down the hours until she got to meet her little girl. However she didnapost progress out of the early stages for more than  hours, and after two days she was fed up so the hospital told her to come in for a routine check up appointment.  The midwe did all the checks and everything seemed fine, until she tried to find the babyaposs heartbeat. Roxanne said: At this point I was thinking maybe itaposs just the equipment. I was starting to worry a bit but I didnapost think anything so terrible had happened. The midwe told her not to worry and went to get another machine, but that didnapost pick up a heartbeat either. It was then that I knew. I knew something bad had happened. They had always been able to find her heartbeat. She was sent straight down for an ultrasound which confirmed Roxanneaposs worst fears. I was having a complete breakdown. Sam just looked completely shocked. He just sat there silently, holding my hand.  I donapost really remember the bits that happened after that. Itaposs like I was looking at it through a fog. They were then taken up to the hospitalaposs bereavement suite, which gave them complete privacy and meant they were away from other pregnant women and newborn babies. Just after .pm, Roxanne gave birth to baby Kaitlyn. Iaposd had been through labour before so I knew what labour felt like, but with Kaitlyn my brain just couldnapost get involved at all. My brain was in a totally dferent place to what my body was doing. The pain was unbelievable. It was far worst than my first labour. It was just dreadful.  In the end Roxanne was given an epidural, which she was grateful for as it meant Kaitlyn could had a peaceful delivery. She said: She had the delivery that I always wanted for her. It was quite beautul. They askedI wanted to see her and I didnapost even hesitate. I couldnapost wait to meet her. I just wanted to have her and hold her in my arms. She was perfect. She looked like any other newborn baby, she just didnapost open her eyes or make a sound. I donapost think I let go of her that night. I cuddled her for hours. During the next few hours they gave Kaitlyn a bath, brushed her hair, took photos and made prints of her hands and footprints.  The hospital lent them a pram so they could go outside and organised for a professional photographer to go out with them to capture the special moment. I really wanted to take her for a walk. I just wanted her to see outside. Over the next few days they went back to the hospital to spend more time with Kaitlyn, introducing her to her big sister. It was really hard to explain it to her. She had no idea what aposdiedapos meant, it was probably the first time she had heard the word. It took a long time, we drip fed it to her over a number of days, probably weeks. She would ask questions and we would keep it very simple and keep repeating the same words.  We donapost talk about sleeping or being poorly as we donapost want her to be scared of those things. We donapost talk about dying in hospital as we donapost want her to be scared of going to hospital. We have to be honest, even though it hurts. The hospital gave them a book called aposPlayground in the Skyapos which they read to her to help her understand, and she still says thataposs where her little sister is now. On the Wednesday Roxanne ed to the hospital on her own to say goodbye to Kaitlyn. I just spent a couple of hours with her. I had written her a letter and bought her a pendant with the letter K on it. I made sure she was wrapped up in her cot with all her things and I left her with the midwe.  I had spent nine months growing her and speaking to her everyday, I felt like I needed to be the last person to give her a kiss and say goodbye and hold her. It was beautul but it really hurt. Every day that we walked out of that hospital without her just felt wrong. You walk past parents carrying their babies and I just thought aposthat should be usapos. It really hurt. Roxanne described the weeks that followed as horrendous. I could barely get out of bed. I cried all the time, just all the time in a way I have never cried before in my le. I couldnapost spent time with our oldest daughter. People kept saying at least youaposve got her to get up for, but it made me panic as I couldnapost spend time with her because every time I saw her I just saw a missing space where Kaitlyn should be.  They just looked so similar. I thought I was a terrible mum. Just a few weeks after losing Kaitlyn the family had to deal with Christmas. It was just brutal. I just felt like I was walking around in a glass box. I could see and hear people but I just wasnapost on this planet. I felt like a ghost. Roxanne and Sam decided to try a Sands support group, and ended up meeting a number of people who truly understood the pain they were feeling. The couple also both used the charityaposs helpline and say it gave them invaluable support when things got really, really bad.  Roxanne said: Iaposve spent hours just crying and talking to them about all the things in my head and theyaposre always there. The couple have also done a number of incredible things in Kaitlynaposs name to help other parents going through the same painful time. They set up a support group at their local hospital called Flutterbyes, offering support to anyone who needs it. One of the things that Roxanne found really helpful during the weeks after saying goodbye to Kaitlyn was a weighted memory bear, custom made to be the exact same weight as she was.

This year, parents avoided the short notice and asked in advance of the holiday - only to be met with the same response.  As an alternative to the Halloween celebrations, the parent council has organised an ‘Autumn Dance’ next month. The parent council said children would be able to dress as they wished and claimed it will not put any additional strain on family budgets and be inclusive of all students.But one angry parent told the Edinburgh Evening News that there were only two parents in attendance at the parent council meeting. They said: St Davidaposs Primary is situated right next to Pirniehall Primary School. Last year it was so lovely to see the other kids from Pirniehall having fun and ours werenapost allowed to because we were told the decision had been made by the parent council to not let the kids dress up because apossome families donapost celebrate Halloween.apos “I felt so sad for the kids. No religion or politics should interfere with children. “It feels like back to the dark century where children have no voice and parents can decide everything they do for them.    The school is described on its website as multicultural, friendly and inclusive and does teach religious education other than Catholicism. The furious parent added: Throughout the year the children are taught about other religions they go to mosques, they learn about celebrating Ramadan and more. I am shocked, we are living in Edinburgh one of the most tolerant cities in the UK, but we have been told our children canapost celebrate Halloween at school because apositaposs not our cultureapos. How is it that this decision has come down to two parents  It is understood that in an email the chair of the parent council said: It was felt that any event organised for Halloweaposen would not be inclusive of all children at the school. The costs involved for parents would put strain on family budgets.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA railway signalman could have played a key role in the Great Train Robbery, a former British Transport Police detective claims. Thomas Wyn-De-Bank was on duty in the signal box close to the spot where the mail train was raided in the early hours of August , . Now retired detective Graham Satchwell believes it is likely he helped the plot to hijack the London-bound train near Bridego Bridge, south of Leighton Buzzard, Beds, on its way from Glasgow with over £million. In his new book Great Train Robbery Confidential, Mr Satchwell reveals Wyn-De-Bank had a criminal past that could have been used by the gang to coerce him into helping them. Poring over files that have been gathering dust for decades, Mr Satchwell identied inconsistencies in two statements given by Wyn-De-Bank. He also found the signalman failed to follow signal failure procedures after the gang tampered with the light to show a red signal, forcing the driver to stop.    And his book reveals that even the British Rail worker’s son, Charlie, thought his dad “sailed close to the wind”. Charlie told the author his father had concealed from his bosses that, prior to his employment, he had served time in Bedford prison for bigamy. A few years after the robbery, one of the signalman’s colleagues told Charlie he suspected Wyn-De-Bank’s involvement in the heist, which was led by armed robber Bruce Reynolds. Mr Satchwell says Wyn-De-Bank failed to make the appropriate calls after the hijacked train was ided by the gang further down the line, or to raise the alarm as robbers including Ronnie Biggs, Charlie Wilson and Tommy Wisbey were making off with mailbags full of cash. These decisions could have given the gang vital time to get away with the loot. Asked about it afterwards, he first said he knew the train had been uncoupled, but then said he did not know.    In his book, Mr Satchwell writes: “Why was he so negligent  Why didn’t he do his job  It seems to me there are only two possible reasons. “Firstly, he might have willingly taken part in the robbery. If that is the case, then he was obviously hopelessly ill-prepared for the British Rail enquiry. “Once the enquiry was overcome his only remaining hurdle would be to give evidence at the trial where his deceit might be uncovered. “He was certainly aided in hiding the truth, wittingly or otherwise, by the British Railways drive to conceal any negligence on their part.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uber passenger who dozed london","story":"NewsUber passenger who dozed off in London wakes up in the Midlands with £, billChris Reed, a DJ also known as Plastician, had been trying to get from Fulham to Croydon in south London - but ended up on a  mile round trip insteadShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe Uber customer says he was taken on a -mile round trip to the Midlands \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Having forked out a sizable sum - for a design which was supposed to resemble a graceful peacock, Rena Davis claims the cake looked more like a lop-sided turkey with leprosy with its head coming off. The -year-old said she was heartbroken when, as the baker who made and delivered the cake drove away, one of the peacocksapos heads fell off. And not only that - the supposed fondant icing was in fact mere buttercream. Rena had booked the baker to create her ideal celebration cake, featuring two birds, a heart shaped sponge and chocolate cupcakes. After showing the baker a picture of a similar cake, featuring one blue peacock, the -year-old bride-to-be handed over the cash a month before her big day.  As the weeks ticked by, Rena was reassured that everything was going aposto planapos, but the night before her wedding, she received a completely dferent cake that was falling apart. Despite chasing the baker for a refund, Rena claim she was initially refused until after sharing her ordeal on social media, after which she received an envelope in her letterbox including  yesterday. Rena, from Grfin, in Georgia, US, said: I felt heartbroken. I saw [the cake] and walked out of the room. It was a lop-sided mess - nothing like I thought it would be like. [Before yesterday], weaposd heard nothing from her since. She had not called or anything. The only reason she gave a refund now was because of the viral post. She said she couldnapost give me my money back at first because she had  hours in it and she had to pay her mom for helping.  Shaming the cake on social media, Renaaposs sister-in-law Annette Hill wrote: The one apospeacockapos looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the white bird, which isnapost white at all, doesnapost even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, itaposs just a brown BLOB! Thereaposs NOTHING supporting the aposbirdsapos and the cake was already sinking so bad from their weight when it was delivered and it continued to sink worse overnight until the next morning, the day of the wedding, the birds were almost sitting on the bottom layer. So, on the morning of her wedding, the bride was going from store to store trying to find a cake that would be suitable to use for her wedding. After the baker dropped off the wedding cake, which was supposed to feature two green and purple peacocks, one of the birdsapos heads reportedly fell off onto Renaaposs floor. Rena asked for a refund but claims she was immediately refused, so the baker ed aposwith a box of Rice Krispiesapos to try and rebuild the animal.  The cake maker even claimed the fondant icing aposkept getting bubbles in itapos. Rena said: [The baker] had made a cake for my best friend one time. Since then, she had supposedly finished baking school in town. First off we sent her a picture via text and she said she could make the cake. I called her and we agreed she would make the cake in a heart shape, and instead of one peacock she would make two. She came the night before the wedding. She set it up on the table and all the time, Iaposm looking at this cake, thinking aposreally, are you serious apos I just walked out of the room. I had nothing  to say to her. Five minutes after sheaposd left, one of the peacocksapos heads had fallen off. I text her and asked for my money back, but she said sheaposd think what she could do.  The next few minutes she shows up at my house with a box of Rice Krispies. The peacocks were supposed to be fondant too, but I donapost know what she had on them. When she came back so tried to fix the white birdaposs head. She went outside to tell my husband that she had worked  hours on that cake, that sheaposd taken time off her job. It looked like itaposd been thrown together the night before. All I asked her was to please give me my money back. I text her when she left to say the cake was not how it was supposed to be. It wasnapost fondant, it was buttercream, and it wasnapost the colours I wanted. She said aposwell, I couldnapost get the fondant to do right - it kept getting bubbles in itapos. I thought, well at least call me  Never once did I get a call. Everything was always going according to plan and she maintained itaposd be there the night before the wedding. Rena was so upset by the cake, she texted to ask the cake maker to collect it, but she refused. The cake remained in her fridge for three days until after the wedding, when she threw it in the bin.

Speaking to news.au, general manager Andrew Badcock confessed that some food brands donapost use real jam in their jam doughnuts at all.Instead they fill the tasty treats with coloured and flavoured apple paste or sauce.    He explained: Some food brands use apple paste or sauce as the core ingredient in their raspberry jam recipe. With its natural sweetness and no pips, apple sauce is widely used for its smooth and ‘jammy’ texture. He added: Many customers show a proclivity towards smoother and more consistent textures in their food choices as it’s a more familiar and comforting experience. Pips, seeds and smaller grains tend to get caught in teeth and a lot of people don’t appreciate that sensation.    So there you have it folks, the world as we know it, is in fact a lie. Ok, maybe thataposs a little bit dramatic, but weaposre still pretty taken aback by this food bomb that has been dropped on us.Just as we were very surprised when we discovered that fish and chip shops donapost serve proper vinegar. According to  YouTuber   Tom Scott,  many chippies instead use something known as a non-brewed condiment in place of vinegar.A non-brewed condiment is a malt vinegar substitute made from water, acetic acid and ious flavourings - yummy! Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent, but it takes less time to make and can be purchased in a concentrated form, so it lasts longer.

Texturally, it is amazing. It goes really dry and crunchy and you put it in the stock and tomatoes it rehydrates but it still has this lovely texture. The flavour is massive, he added.

Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9464d32ed745.15718946-846x564.jpg ","title":"dad always said hed be teaching until his final day and he was tributes paid to much loved broughty ferry driving instructor","story":"A driving instructor who helped four generations of families in Broughty Ferry get behind the wheel has died aged .Bill Anderson, of Strome Terrace, who set up Broughty Ferry School of Motoring in , died on Monday having been admitted to hospital two weeks earlier.Bill had been taken in for bowel surgery but developed bronchitis and pneumonia which he was too weak to fight off.He leaves behind his we Norma, , two daughters Lorraine Kneebone, , and Lezley Cassidy, , and four grandchildren Nick, , Ross, , Jamie, , and Tamzyn, .Lorraine said: “Dad was a friendly gentleman, he had a great sense of humour and got on with everyone.“He loved his business.

The work he does defensively probably goes unnoticed.“If you ask the boys in our team about what he does going back the pitch, that’s why they trust him so much and why I trust him so much.“We have challenged him to be better up the pitch like everyone  and on Saturday he was.“I think he needed that wee boost because of his play over the course of the season, particularly going back the game in games when we’ve needed him.“In the Alloa game, Jack Hamilton made the penalty save in that game butMcDaid hadn’t ran  yards to clear the ball at the back post we draw that game and there’s further frustration at the football club.“That’s what he does going that way and we have seen what he can do going the other way on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9eee32af2d08.68303189-e1570712070257.jpg ","title":"teletots 2019 final chance to grab top prizes","story":"Time is fast running out for families to take part in our TeleTots photo contest for the cutest Tayside toddlers.A Tele photographer has been on hand to capture the smiling faces of hundreds of boys and girls free of charge in this year’s event at the Overgate shopping centre. vw, px\"  However, the competition draws to a close this weekend.

We all came to the conclusion that the best thing for Scott is a full working week.“Scott was touch and go to be joining them. Both Steve and I feel it is probably betterScott gets the full week of training here because he has missed enough football already this season.”As well as the match against Russia there would also be the issue of the four-hour flight to Moscow having only recently recovered from a hamstring tear.McKenna missed the Euro  qualying home defeats to Russia and group leaders Belgium last month having suffered the injury a week earlier.Those defeats effectively killed any slim hopes of qualication via Group I. Second-placed Russia are nine points ahead of Scotland, who languish in fth spot.The Dark Blues’ focus now turns towards attempting to build momentum and positivity from the remaining qualiers ahead of the UEFA Nations League play-offs looming in March.It is understood McKenna has received assurances from national boss Clarke that he will be in the squad for the next round of games.Scotland’s patched-up defence will tonight face Russian football’s top goal-scorer Aleksandr Sobolev, who has netted  goals in  games for Krylia Sovetov.The -year-old is set for a debut cap and replaces injured Fedor Smolov of Lokomotiv Moscow.

It has to be remembered that the manager has only had two weeks to work with the squad.“He had a week in the summer with two games and a week last timewith two games.“Relative to club football where a manager gets a full five or six weeks to embed his philosophy and get across what he wants to do, with the national team the manager gets the bare minimum amount of time.“At one point we did a double session when preparing for a game, that’s probably quite unheard of at international level.“But we need to make use of the time we’ve got without upsetting the intensity load on the players.“The manager has been getting his points across and with each the players are understanding what he wants and what is demanded.“Everybody is working well and delighted to be involved so I think the more time the manager gets the better it will be.”This is the fourth Scotland squad Devlin has been in, but he has still to make his international bow.The former Hamilton Accies player looked set to feature under previous boss Alex McLeish against Albania and Israel in the Nations League last November.However, an ankle injury sustained in training meant he missed out on a debut and ended up spending three months on the sidelines.Devlin ed to the Scotland squad in June, but didn’t make it off the bench against Cyprus or Belgium.At the start of this season he suffered a hamstring injury after playing in the - Pittodrie win over RoPS Rovaniemi of Finland in the Europa League first qualying round first leg on July .Devlin didn’tto the fray for the Dons until August .Following his solid display in a - home victory against Ross County he was called into the national squad for last month’s double header with Russia and Belgium after injuries to David Bates and Grant Hanley.Since then Devlin has started all of Aberdeen’s game, apart from Saturday’s - draw with Hibs where he was on the bench.He added: “It has been great to be involved in the Scotland squad.“But I’ve also got a job to do with Aberdeen. I hadn’t been playing and then got the opportunity against Ross County.“We won the game - which was good and then I have to try to keep myself in the team.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray Surgery are delighted to announce a competition for Lochgilphead High School Pupils to design a new name and logo for our services which has been launched in the High School this week.Our name and logo will be changing, but the care we deliver and how we deliver it will not be changing under our current plans.In  the GPs in Lochgilphead took over the surgeries in Inveraray and Furnace.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

One per cent of this is from collecting, treating and pumping drinking water to homes.A huge amount of energy goes into making tap water safe to drink and Scottish Water is one of the largest single users of electricity in Scotland.The remaining five per cent is from heating water in the home, with around one fth of household heating bills spent on heating water.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

After some detailed discussion it was agreed that these affected areas would continue to be mown regularly to maintain the appearance of the park, said Mr Turnbull.But the community council agreed that bioersity could be increased in an area of Haylodge that would not detract from the amenity of open spaces.Mr Turnbull explained: ldquoA suggestion was made that a flat piece of parkland at the extreme western end of the park could be converted into a community orchard where fruit trees that thrive in our climate could be planted, this could include ieties of apple, pears and plums and such like.ldquoIt is reassuring to see that managers in SBC recognise the validity of the communityrsquos concerns and have agreed not to make any changes, as proposed, in the way these areas are currently managed.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

between Tranent and Longniddry, but it is clear the local authority wants the community to have a new name ndash a stance which has upset some.Information packs about the naming consultation process have been sent to schools and the councilrsquos head of development, Douglas Proudfoot, told the Courier at the launch of the naming consultation earlier this month that pupils were ldquofree to

be retained.Yet the Courier has learnt that in letters sent out to headteachers, Mr Innes has made it clear that the council wants a ldquofresh, new name for this new town.This has called into question just how much ldquofreedom pupils really have in the naming process.And the packs sent out to schools say that ldquothe mine was called Blindwells, but we [the council] donrsquot think that fits with all the great new facilities that are going to be in the new town.Harry Cairney, honorary president of Prestonpans Labour Club and president of Scotmid, worked at the mine from  until its closure in .He was saddened that the Blindwells name was not deemed worthy of the town in future.ldquoBlindwells was such a large employer itrsquos unfortunate that they donrsquot want to stick with the name, he said.ldquoIrsquod love to know why. Everyone calls it Blindwells and they use the name with affection.ldquoTheyrsquoll probably end up calling it some long, drawn-out name that no one has any connection to, and everyone will keep calling it Blindwells anyway!Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council has written to East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch stating that it wants the name Blindwells to appear on the final shortlist of names.Brian Weddell, Prestonpans Community Council chair, had similar views.

No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"nobel-prize-winners-give-shout-out-big-bang-theory","story":"The announcement that a trio of scientists had won the physics Nobel started off with an unlikely reference: the opening lines of the popular US television show in which its two main characters - Sheldon and Amy - won the Nobel Prize.\"The whole universe was in the hot, dense state, then nearly  billion years ago expansion started,\" academy member Ulf Danielsson said at the start of the presentation, using the opening words of the Big Bang theme song.One Canadian and two Swiss scientists won the physics prize for their work in understanding how the universe has evolved from the Big Bang and the blockbuster discovery of a planet outside our solar system.Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the reference seemed fitting since the series was a \"fantastic achievement\" in bringing the \"world of science to laptops and living rooms around the world\".The Big Bang Theory, which debuted in  and ended its run earlier this year, overcame early doubts to become a cult classic.The show was led by a crew of nerdy misfits, all scientists on the west coast of the United States.During the finale, the shows friends took one last trip together to support married couple Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, and Amy, played by Mayim Bialik, after they won the Nobel Prize in physics.The couple waited anxiously by the phone while friends prank-called them before receiving the actual decision.Mr Hansson said he hoped the fans of the show liked this years Nobel Prizes.\"I hope that Sheldon and Amy are not too disappointed today.\""},{"url":null,"title":"hand-sends-memo-wields-much-power","story":"Anonymous Downing Street adviserldquoAdvisers advise and Ministers decide.Margaret ThatcherHE likes a quote, does Dominic Cummings. The Prime Ministerrsquos chief adviser might or might not have been the author of an  word note to a Spectator journalist setting out the dire consequences for anyone who dared to scupper the UKrsquos exit from the EU on October , but several Tory MPs, including former Minister Amber Rudd, thought they saw his fingerprints all over it. Eight hundred words, eh  Someone was quite the demented woodpecker.Complaints were made in the Commons about intemperate language from Number , and fevered brows were duly soothed by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Mr Gove knows Mr Cummings well. When the Scot became Education Secretary he brought him into Government as his adviser. Their ties go back even further, some  years, to when they were both starting out in their careers.Mr Gove is in a select club of those who can claim familiarity with Mr Cummings. Others look to his blog for clues, which is where they will find quote after quote, from TS Eliot to From Russia With Love , to back up his philosophy of government, the universe and everything. If you have an extremely high boredom threshold, and a liking for the kind of macho guano contained in the business section at airport bookshops, I can thoroughly recommend it.: Civil court delays decisionThe Number  aide is not the first adviser to provoke interest. From Marcia Falkender and Alastair Campbell to Nick Timothy and Fiona Hillthere is a special circle in political anorakdom reserved for those unelected iniduals who serve elected politicians.The latest data on special advisers in the UK Government puts their number at . Their salaries, which can range from pound, to pound,, cost the taxpayer pound million. But they are everywhere where politicians gather, from Bute House to the White House, and rarely will you know them by name. Lobby journalists know them, they know each other, and the civil servants know them, but generally speaking the special adviser, or Spad, is the man or woman standing out of sight of the cameras. Like journalists, when they become the story it is time to go. Think Jo Moore, the Labour adviser who will forever be known for saying   was a ldquogood day to bury bad news.Every so often, as in the Moore case, or when a question is asked about the number of advisers and their cost to the public purse, Spads will come under the spotlight, only to fade away again when something more interesting turns up. Mr Cummings has changed that. From sacking a member of staff and having them marched off the premises, as happened with an aide to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, to ramping up the political temperature, Mr Cummings is rewriting the rules as he goes. Such is Boris Johnsonrsquos reliance on him that he is less a mere aide and more a de facto deputy Prime Minister.Special advisers are nothing new. From the first time someone claimed power over others, courts have had their courtiers. Whether in government or out, their tasks are many and ied. They are supposed to be their bossrsquos eyes and ears, there to pick up on things in advance. They think ahead in other ways, planning the direction of policy, the subjects for legislation or other action. Crucially, they have some control over access to the politician and cling to it for dear le. If anyone can have the ear of the minister, why do they need you : Iain Macwhirter on the blame gameSpecial advisers stayed for the most part behind the curtain until Harold Wilsonrsquos resignation honours of . The ldquolavender list of recipients, some of them highly questionable, was said to have been drawn up on coloured notepaper by Wilsonrsquos chief aide, Marcia Falkender. She denied doing so.Lady Falkender, who died earlier this year, was valued by Wilson for her insights into the minds of so-called ordinary voters she was a tireless planner and she was not afraid of making enemies in the party or in the civil service, especially the latter. The agenda, Wilsonrsquos agenda, had to get through. Remind you of anyone Labour politicians seem to have a thing for the adviser as enforcer. Though neither inidual will relish the companion, this yearrsquos Dominic Cummings was yesteryearrsquos Alastair Campbell. Tony Blairrsquos spokesman wielded extraordinary power, right up to and including putting a case together for war that turned out to be entirely wrong. Campbellrsquos chief asset, as far as Blair was concerned, was his willingness to be an attack dog on the bossrsquos behalf.One can understand why political leaders like to surround themselves with special advisers. As many a memoir sets out, it is tough and lonely at the top. A bad day at the office for most folk is just that, a bad day. For a leader it can be a catastrophe. The stream of questions is relentless, the need to make a decision always pressing. Who would not want to turn to a friendly face, someone you knew was in your corner, at such times  Before the special adviser came along there were such people. There still are such people. They are called civil servants. They can give impartial advice because their tenure is not tied to any one politician or administration.: Brexit deal on brinkAnother argument in favour of special advisers is that they bring new voices and viewpoints into government. Exceptyou had ever met one you would know they did the opposite. The special adviser is a symptom of the wholly unhealthy professionalisation of politics. They look like the politicians they serve, they think like them, and they want the same job eventually.But where is the ultimate harm, you might think, particularly given the modern Spad has to abide by a code of conduct. The power and influence exercised by Mr Cummings, which seems to be above that of a Cabinet Minister, suggests the need for a new code. Better still, there should be a review of paid aides in general and a presumption against employing them.As for Mr Cummings, he knows, as a student of politics, that the ultimate job of an adviser is to act as a shield to their employer. Shields can always be replaced."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-brexit-plan-not-shown-snp-govt","story":"The Brexit Secretary will chair the first Joint Ministerial Council on EU Negotiations to be held in Edinburgh with UK and Welsh ministers.The gathering comes as relations between the UK and devolved governments hit a new low after Boris Johnson submitted his Brexit deal plans to the EU without consultation.Mr Russell yesterday told MSPs there had been ldquono correspondence between the UK and Scottish governments in advance of the proposals.He said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has not been treated as a trusted partner.

Edinburgh and Glasgow have both expressing an interest in introducing the levy.Scottish Labour MSP Neil Bibby, who tabled an amendment to scrap the tax, said it was ldquonothing more than a political fix to pass a budget.His party also sought to exempt lower-paid workers, single parents and the drivers of ultra-low emission cars.

this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality .."},{"url":null,"title":"kelso council keen to see borders railway s return to town","story":"More about the railway latest here: https:www.thesouthernreporter news people confidence-high-that-borders-railway-extension-now-a-certainty--"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poster-council.jpg","title":"people urged to stand for community council elections in the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePeople in the Highlands are being encouragedto stand for election to their local community councils.Nominations are being invited from peopleseeking election to all community councils across Highland this autumn.

Dave explained that during his search for information he hit a “dead-end” and so he decided to visit Ballymena in the hope of finding out more about his family tree.The couple stayed at the Tullyglass House Hotel and Dave’s first port of call on Wednesday of last week was the Ballymenaoffice.He said: “I really wanted to come to Ballymena to try and find out more about my ancestors. Im here for three days so I plan to try and find some McClures in the area and see where that takes us.“I was in Belfast checking the records there but I didnt find much so I am hoping we might get a bit closer to finding out something here in Ballymena.”Before leaving tohome Dave explained that he had not uncovered much more about his McClure ancestors, however, in the past few days he “met such wonderful people in my search”. Dave continued: “The librarians in Ballymena sent me to Clough, where I met Norm the postmistress. She sent me to Glarryford where I visited the Killymurris Presbyterian Church cemetery before heading to Ballymoney where Daniel Gillan at the Tower Pub sent me to the town hall museum where Paul put me in touch with genealogist Kathleen by phone. “After a twenty minute conversation I decided to continue conversing with her by email when Ito the States. “I didnt uncover any new facts about my McClure ancestors but I believe I have walked where they trod and looked upon the land they once viewed. If they were anything like the people of this area I am very proud of them indeed.”Dave, a keen writer, explained that his father was a dairy farmer and he has three brothers and a sister.He said: “My brothers and sister are keen to hear all about the trip and I will be telling them all about how great and friendly the people of Ballymena are.”As well as Ballymena the couple visited Dublin, Donegal, Belfast and the Giants Causeway before travelling on to Scotland and then flying home.If anyone has information that may be of help to Dave you can contact him via email daveintheshack@gmail  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2326850.jpg--.jpg?1570704312000\n","title":"mood as miserable as weather as wrightbus saga drags on","story":" noon: THE mood of ex-Wrightbus workers matched the miserable weather which prevailed over Ballymena this morning.Around  to  ex workers and supporters are mounting a vigil at the factory gates and so far its been wet, cold and - to be honest - disheartening.Hopes that something could be salvaged from the Wrightbus collapse seemed to be dashed just after .am when Unite representative George Brash informed the men and women that landowner Jeff Wright had issued a statement essentially saying no deal.To be honest, the mood at that stage was not one of anger or frustration as most people would imagine - it is best summed up with the word confusion.Did he seriously say no deal , asked one man. Heads round him nodded. It seemed surreal.A few minutes later there was an update from the union official who, having spoken to the administrator, said there was still potential for a deal despite in his words, Jeffchanging the goalposts. As far as he could tell them the deal was still hanging by a thread.The response this time was clear and uneqivocal. Not surprisingly there was a great deal of exasperation and the TV cameras will be well to blot out the round of expletives which greeted the news.In a statement Jeff Wright said the sticking point was farmland which he does not consider to be part of the factory site.He said failure to complete a deal is deeply regrettable, especially after the exhaustive efforts all of us involved have gone to in providing every possible support.The Ballymena business was placed into administration and put up for sale in September.The Wrightbus premises are owned separately from the manufacturing business and held in a company called Whirlwind Property Two, which is not part of the Wrights group and is therefore not under the control of the administrator.The property company is controlled by Jeff Wright, the former owner of Wrightbus.English industrialist Jo Bamford wants to buy the Wrightbus business and the factory through his Ryse Hydrogen company.Mr Wright said that he hopes the firms administrator, Deloitte, have not been side-tracked by the Bamford engagement and can now put their energies into delivering a deal by working with the remaining bidders to secure the future of Wrightbus and the jobs in Ballymena. DUP MP Ian Paisley told the BBCs Good Morning Ulster programme that: Today is decision day.If the answer is that we cannot get the deal consummated, in terms of the land sale deal, then Im afraid the worst of all situations prevails and were left with liquidation of assets of the company, he said.Its either the continuation of building the best buses produced in the world or its the end of bus building in Ballymena.The North Antrim MP said Mr Bamford told him on Tuesday that jobs would be created within two weeks,a deal is made.The Wright family have made a mammoth contribution to Northern Ireland over three generations and this maintains that rich history, said Mr Paisley.Everyone needs to put their shoulder to the line and get this deal over the line.In his statement Mr Wright said Mr Paisleys role as North Antrim MP had been unhelpful to say the least and advised that he left the business of deal making to the professionals at Deloitte.UNITEStatement released from Unite the Union, Northern IrelandWrightbus workers await their fate in the rain as horse-trading over sale continues. Unite the union has received no response to request to meet with former Wrightbus owner Jeff Wright. Conflicting reports leave workers standing at factory gates bewildered about their futureUnite Regional Officer for Wrightbus, George Brash, challenged both sides in the ongoing negotiations surrounding the sale of the stricken bus builder to move quickly to reach an agreement that would safeguard the livelihoods of the workers.“This morning hundreds of Wrightbus workers and their families are standing in the rain outside the factory gates. They are standing in the hope they will hear that a deal has been done that will guarantee their jobs.“These are workers who are already having dficult conversations with their children about what Christmas will bring.“As these negotiations are being dragged out by horse-trading, the feeling of indignation among these workers, whose sole objective is to get back to work, is rising.“We understand that an outline deal had been arrived at yesterday but that this morning further changes were made by Jeff Wright which threw the entire negotiations into uncertainty.“For our part Unite has sought to engage directly with Jeff Wright but as yet our request for a meeting has gone unanswered. We are calling on all sides, in particular Jeff Wright, to do the right thing and adopt a sensible approach that will open the door to a future for these workers”, Mr Brash concluded.

We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us.

This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with

implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously

Films in the UK are awarded ratings by the British Board of Film Classication based on content raging from U which means suitable for all to  which means suitable only for adults.Joker is rated  and contains scenes of strong bloody violence including murder and language while It was also given a  rating due to strong gory violence, horror and language. Mr McAdam, who runs Movie House Cinemas across Northern Ireland, said that cinemas were being forced to turn young people away due to age classications.\"Its not just ourselves, its every cinema in the UK,\" he explained.\"Its becoming a major problem, parents are bringing their children to the cinema to see a film and then being challenged over their age. Its not pleasant challenging parents or young people.\"Some parents may feel comfortable allowing their children to watch certain things in their own home but we cant do that, we are bound by the rules.\"Mr McAdam said that any cinema allowing people to enter films underage could face penalties.\"We have responsibilities, cinemas are licensed by councils and any cinema found to be breaching the rules could lose their license,\" he explained.  data-dfpadtargetingJames McAvoy as Bill Denbrough in IT Chapter Two\"Its the same as the pub, you have to be eighteen to drink and its the exact same for an  film. \"Parents may allow their child to have a shandy or a can of beer in the house before they turn , but they cant go drinking in a pub and its the same here.\"The cinema owner said he wanted to create some awareness around the issue.\"The last thing I want to see is disappointed families or children,\" Mr McAdam said.\"These films are given these ratings for a reason, it could be due to violence or sexual content or language that parents dont realise their children will be seeing. \"Anyone who wants to see these films will need to bring the relevant identication with them or they wont be allowed in.\" The Joker has attracted controversy after it was claimed that its depiction of the main character could be seen as reminiscent of those who commit mass shootings in the United States.Other critics have expressed concern that the sympathetic portrayal of the Joker, despite his actions as a psychopathic killer could inspire real world violence. However other critics have defended the film and main actor Jaoquin Phoenix has been tipped for an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the lead character in the film which has broken box office records.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"nadine tipped enter celebrity jungle","story":"Derry singer, Nadine Coyle, is to feature in one of televisions most-watched reality series, it is being reported.The former Girls Aloud member is set enter the Australian jungle to take part in “Im a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.”The -year-oldrecently split from partner, Jason Bell, father of her five-year-old daughter, Anaiya.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshSeries producers are reportedly hoping the Derry girl will “tell the bars” about her former bandmates.Being tipped to join her Down Under are former Glasgow Rangers and Scottish international footballer, Ally McCoist, Breakfast TV presenter Lorraine Kelly and celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay.The series – to be screened to millions on all of ITVs networks from the end of next month – will once again be presented by Declan Donnelly and Ant McPartlin."},{"url":null,"title":"wales rally gb day two british driver leads way north wales stage begins","story":"The Wales Rally GB begins near Chester on Thursday afternoon.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guestsat the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us.

There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

I am now glad to put the record straight after all these years.The sides have met twice in the league this season, drawing - to - at Pairc Eoghan Rua and Kilcoo won thegame in Warrenpoint - to -.The mood music in Kilcoo this season has been good.Their - to - win over Clonduff in the league last Wednesday night clinched the ACFL Division  crown, last lted by Mickey Morans side in  and they are even more intent on adding the Frank OHare Cup on Sunday.Losing out to Burren in last years decider was a big blow to Kilcoo, but they have put that reversal behind them with the exact same squad of players.What you see with Kilcoo is what you get.They have a unique work ethic and everything revolves around the team as a unit. No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by .

SONI managing director Jo Aston said that the strategy was a \"direct response to the climate crisis and the UK Governments commitment to zero net carbon emissions by \" “To do this we must innovate for the next generation while ensuring today’s electricity users have a reliable, secure and cost-effective supply,” she said.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says.

PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.
