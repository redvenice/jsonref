It puts 500 jobs at risk.The Duchess of Cambridge’s favourite high street brand is now working with Ernst \u0026amp Young to help decide the \u0027best way through\u0027 the upcoming \u0027difficult and unstable times.\u0027Its undoing was blamed by commentators on high prices and a failure to compete well enough with rivals offering same or next day delivery services. The move comes after LK Bennett reported losses of £5.9 million in 20162017, compared with a £100,000 profit in the previous 12 months. LK Bennett\u0027s founder, Linda Bennett emailed staff today about the intention to file for administration. She thanked staff for their \u0027hard work and dedication\u0027 and added that she didn\u0027t regret returning to the brand in 2017 to try and \u0027reinvigorate\u0027 the label.LK Bennett is the latest in a line of big  names to become causalities in the bloodbath on the high street. The UK\u0027s largest toy shop Toys R Us went into administration in February 2018, leading to an estimated 2,000 redundancies and Marks and Spencer announced plans last  May to close 100 stores by 2022.  The British brand opened in 1990 and is now well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities and royals including Kate Middleton who is pictured wearing dresses from the brand during a tour of Australia in 2014Fashion brand Orla Kiely, which was also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, also went out of business with debts of more than £7.25m (€8.1m) last year. High Street clothing giant Gap also announced today that it will close 230 stores worldwide as its US parent company launches a massive restructuring programme.The closures amount to nearly a fifth of its total shops although the company has not said where stores will shut or how many jobs will be affected.           Shoppers have said the brand put prices up after Kate Middleton started wearing their clothes          LK Bennett is the latest big name to become a casualty in the bloodbath on the high street          The Sludge wedge increased by £20 after it became popular with Kate Middleton          LK Bennett\u0027s Natalie clutch bag also increased in price by £20 in 2012Both of these items saw their price increase by £20 after the royal was snapped in public with them.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail how labels can struggle to keep up with demand  after  public figures wear their clothes.She said: \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand\u0027 can \u0027involve huge costs for the label.\u0027                                                    However customers have said the store \u0027put their prices up\u0027 after Kate started being seen wearing their clothes and got engaged to Prince William.Others have also criticised the brand\u0027s prices, saying \u0027that not many people have £300 spare to buy one dress\u0027.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.Ms Shiels added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once.\u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.\u0027Fashion commentator Karine Laudort also told MailOnline: \u0027The Duchess of Cambridge may be a fan but the everyday woman in Britain may think twice before spending an extra £100 on a outfit, \u0027Especially when most online retailers now offer free 24-hour or same day delivery.\u0027 Today the brand was running an offer for 25 per cent off the entire new season range online and in store.Customers could also enjoy free UK delivery on all orders. Items  in the new range that were eligible for the discount included colourful court shoes priced at £195, a gold envelope clutch bag costing £175 and a variety of midi dresses costing around £300.  LK Bennett is well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and royals including Kate Middleton.Kate took a two year hiatus from the brand and wasn\u0027t spotted wearing it on any public occasions after August 2016. But she reaffirmed her love for it, just a few months ago – wearing a green and cream silk polka dot dress for a visit to the Evelina London Children\u0027s hospital, in December 2018.           Kate, pictured at Kings Cross St Pancras station in London, also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen in March 2012  Holly Willoughby, left in one of the brand\u0027s dresses at the Chelsea Flower Show in May and Katherine Jenkins, right in the Izzy dress and Priyanka Courts at her album signing in London in December, are also among the famous fans of the fashion label          Linda Bennett, pictured at Buckingham Palace, received an OBE for services to the fashion industry in the New Year Honours list in 2016Kate also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee UK Tour in 2012. This elegant look included the £395 Jude jacket and £225 Davina dress which she paired with a pillbox hat by James Lock. High Street clothing giant Gap to close 230 stores worldwide...The curse of Kate!

Linda Bennett, pictured, came back to the company in 2017 after leaving in 2008 when she sold her majority stake  for between £80m and 100mBennett founded the brand 29 years ago in 1990 with a store in Wimbledon, London. The brand grew quickly into an international chain and Bennett decided to sell the business to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity in 2008 for around £80-100million.Despite having sold off the brand she retained a stake on the company board, before re-joining in 2017 as a consultant to the management team.In September 2017 Bennett increased her investment in the company and bought out the remaining equity from private equity owner Phoenix Equity Partners and at the time the brand was operating more than 260 shops and concessions in more than 30 countries.After the acquisition by Bennett the company stated that it would continue to expand and subsequently launched stores in China, Russia and the US.  The curse of Kate!

The high street store is set to file for administration\u0027Retailers must walk a fine line between supply and demand, with production based on a number of factors including historical sales figures, market trends and buyer behaviour. \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand, which is what happens to a garment when the Duchess is spotted wearing it, often means that another immediate production run is required to satisfy demand and maximise the sales opportunity. \u0027Unfortunately, this can involve huge costs for the label, which then is unable to forecast when the sales surge is likely to suddenly drop again. \u0027The science behind production is therefore thrown into disarray and costs can easily spiral.\u0027 The Duchess, 37, has been spotted wearing L.K. Bennett numerous times - from a printed blue and white dress to her go-to black booties.Claire added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once. \u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.           The Duchess of Cambridge sporting an LK Bennett dress for a dinner at Kensington Palace, London, during former US President Barack Obama\u0027s state visit to Britain in 2016          Kate, 37, wore a white and blue floral L.K.Bennett dress during a visit to Luton with national charity Youthscape in August 2016\u0027Despite the financial woes currently experienced by some of her favourite labels however, it is the market – not Kate - that is to blame for the mass closure of many high street stores. \u0027As well as L.K.Bennett Hobbs, Orla Kiely, Alice Temperley and Issa have all experienced significant financial difficulties.\u0027Although it\u0027s a difficult time for retail, Claire claims some lower-priced brands including Zara and Primark have got it right.She said: \u0027Zara is in the enviable position to have been able to bring its manufacturing process in-house rather than outsourcing abroad, meaning costs are reduced and the brand is able to react quickly to a sudden increase in demand. \u0027At the other end of the scale, Primark is continuing to thrive due, it is said to its mass market appeal and its focus on engagement with its customers through social media.\u0027It is the stores which are best able to adapt and have a supply chain flexible enough to cope with fluctuating demand and market trends which will survive.

Soyuz tickets have skyrocketed over the years - NASA currently pays $82million per seat.Boeing aims to conduct the first test flight of its Starliner capsule in April, with astronauts on board possibly in August.An estimated 5,000 NASA and contractor employees, tourists and journalists gathered in the wee hours at Kennedy Space Center with the SpaceX launch team, as the Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from the same spot where Apollo moon rockets and space shuttles once soared.Bridenstine said he\u0027s confident that astronauts will soar on a Dragon or Starliner - or both - by year\u0027s end.

If there is a vote on the 12th and it takes two months to carry out the procedure, it would be justified.\u0027Mrs May has said that if her deal is rejected by Parliament, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, and if that is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit for a limited period.Today the leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a joint warning to the Prime Minister over colleagues they believe are poised to delay or block Article 50 altogether.The pair write in the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027The active pursuit of a delay to Brexit - with no purpose beyond frustration - is a betrayal of the referendum result.\u0027They say this would be an \u0027irretrievable breach of trust\u0027 to those who voted Brexit but also warned against the ruptures that would be caused by a no-deal. How Cox\u0027s \u0027codpiece\u0027 might save the day and allow PM\u0027s...PM\u0027s war on \u0027death cult\u0027 Tories: Vote down Brexit deal again...Share this articleThe news comes as Mr Barnier said Brussels was ready to give further \u0027guarantees, assurances and clarifications\u0027 that the Irish backstop should only be temporary.The backstop has been a sticking point for Brexiteers who see it as undermining the very sovereignty the UK stands to gain through leaving the EU. Mr Barnier insisted that the controversial measure, intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, will not be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement.While acknowledging Brexiteer concerns that the backstop is a trap that would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, Mr Barnier insisted it is only \u0027insurance\u0027 intended for the \u0027worst-case scenario\u0027.Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt, Mr Barnier said: \u0027We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.\u0027This is not the case.

The men were paid £48 million overall – or 13 times the amount paid to women. On average, women earned £232,687 compared with £1.14 million for men.Experts said the pay gap could be explained by the fact that most of the women on bank boards are non-executive directors. That means they are not responsible for day-to-day operations.Non-executive roles tend to be part time and typically involve advising on board matters rather than executing strategies.Banks have boosted the number of women non-executives to make their boardrooms more erse.

Joss Stone plays the world\u0027s most unlikely gigWhen British singer Joss Stone, barefoot as usual, walked on stage and greeted the crowd, she began one of the strangest concerts ever, writes Ian Birrell.For a start, it was 11am, an unlikely time for a show. Then there was the venue, a small hall in Derik, in the north-eastern corner of war-torn Syria.Bizarrely, Friday\u0027s audience of 70 was made up of about two dozen uniformed foreign fighters with a Kurdish militia, along with five middle-aged women, some excited teenagers and a few curious families with children.           British singer Joss Stone, barefoot as usual, walked on stage and greeted the crowd, she began one of the strangest concerts everTo cap it all, Stone was accompanied by photographer Paul Conroy, sneaking back into the country for the first time since he was wounded in the 2012 Syrian rocket strike that killed war reporter Marie Colvin – as seen in the hit film A Private War.Stone, 31, who is on her Total World Tour and aiming to play in every country on the planet, said: \u0027It was very different – we have played 174 countries and that was unique. But I\u0027m really happy to be here.\u0027This is a very small section of Syria where people come to be safe but the rest of it is not safe.

Surely, I thought, it must be a coincidence? And yet the timing felt troubling.Could it be possible that our phones are somehow eavesdropping on our conversations – and that key phrases are being logged and used to send us targeted adverts? The implications, if true, are chilling.           Ad for glasses... After talking about eyesightWe are obsessed with our phones. They accompany us to our most personal spaces – our homes, our bedrooms and bathrooms – are privy to our most intimate of conversations and are used for all aspects of our business, personal and financial lives.But what I discovered over several days of investigation reveals what can only be described as a frightening new chapter in our relationship with these devices.To me, there is no doubt: the microphones on our phones are indeed listening to our everyday lives.We do not even have to be using our phones to make a call for them to eavesdrop. Unless the microphone is disabled, they appear to be able to pick up words and phrases and translate them into related adverts which then appear in apps such as Instagram and Facebook.If I hadn’t observed this insidious behaviour for myself, I wouldn’t have believed it was possible.Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, completely denies using microphones to eavesdrop on conversations, or to tailor adverts. They insist they only show adverts based on user’s interests and information they voluntarily upload. How then can they explain what I uncovered in this investigation?          Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, completely denies using microphones to eavesdrop on conversations, or to tailor advertsI carried my iPhone with me at all times over the course of a week. It was always switched on and close enough to me for it to be able to ‘hear’ any conversations. One day, I visited my GP for an NHS check-up, and she booked me for a blood test. By the time I was back with the nurse to take my blood, I had received an offer on Facebook from private firm Thriva offering me a ‘blood test today’.From there, I met a friend for lunch. I’d decided to purposely discuss obscure subjects so that my previous internet search history wouldn’t interfere with any new ads.          If you have an iPhone, you will also need to turn off the Siri applicationTo do so, go into your Settings, scroll down to ‘Siri and Search’ and switch off the tab that says ‘Allow Siri when locked’.If you want to keep your social-media apps, you can visit each one in Settings and switch off the ‘Microphone’ tab.Alternatively, if you have an Android phone, navigate to Settings and disable or turn off the microphone, and also disable ‘Okay Google’, which allows the phone to react to voice commands.                                                    The following day, my Instagram was full of dozens of Italian adverts, including one for an exhibition, another for a singer’s new album and various Italian holiday offers.But that wasn’t the full extent of my phone’s espionage. It was also, I discovered, spying on my pictures.A friend sent me a picture on WhatsApp of a £1,190 Chloe Nile leather cross-body bag that she had seen in Selfridges. I had never Googled or looked up the bag myself. It was too expensive for me, so I replied: ‘I wonder if we could find a replica.’Days later, a similar bag popped up in an advert on my phone, priced at a far more realistic £39.99. Surely not another coincidence?WhatsApp would say so. They insist your messages are so encrypted that even they can’t tell you what you’ve been sending.A little research threw up a similar case of an American woman called Jen Lewis, who in 2017 posted a picture of herself on Twitter wearing a pink shirt and blue jeans.She was subsequently targeted on Facebook by a lingerie company, which sent her an ad of a model wearing an almost identical outfit.She wrote in a post to her page: ‘Uh, Facebook just served me a bra ad where a woman is wearing the outfit that I’m currently wearing.’It went viral, with 21,400 ‘likes’ from people around the world. Facebook insisted it was coincidence, but thousands of people were unconvinced, suggesting that the woman’s phone or laptop camera was targeted with image-recognition software.Of course, the questionable habits of social-media giants in harvesting our personal data is nothing new.Most people will already know that, when they use a search engine or visit certain websites, they can expect to be targeted by related adverts in their internet browser.But the idea that our conversations, and photographs are being collected is a different prospect entirely.          This time, I got ads on both my Facebook and Instagram accounts from airlines AND photography companiesI got in touch with Dr Vitor Jesus, senior lecturer in cyber-security and privacy at Birmingham University. ‘I’m not surprised by the sequence of events you experienced,’ he told me.‘Every time you download an app and give it permission to access personal information, whether it be photographs, contacts or microphone, you open yourself to being targeted. The companies tell us they do this, but the information is buried in long agreements and policies that most of us don’t bother to read. So I say, buyer beware!          Ads in Italian... After listening to Italian radio‘There is no such thing as a free app. And at the moment, because users are technically giving permission, it is not illegal.’This ‘permission’ is tacitly given because the microphones on most people’s phones are always left on. The phones are pre-programmed to listen for ‘trigger’ phrases which activate personal assistant apps such as Siri or Alexa. This means that many other apps could be using the same technology without the phone owner’s knowledge.Dr Jesus said: ‘It is entirely possible to have multiple apps listening in the background all the time, with each being triggered by keywords.‘Your details are then passed on to the relevant companies who will bombard you with adverts.’The precise way this works is still something of a mystery – even to experts – because it depends on which app is listening in. But it is thought that app developers create a list of keywords relating to its advertisers or their products.The microphone sends conversations through transcription software which instantly turns it from speech to text.If key words or phrases are present, the app triggers adverts to be sent to users.Paolo Sartori, managing director of cyber-security firm TransWorldCom, believes companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have all developed algorithms that allow this process to work effectively.           Ad for a copycat bag... After getting a photo of the real thing‘We conducted our own mini-test in the office a few months back, and it was certainly an eye-opener,’ he said. ‘We used phrases around razors and lady shaving. That evening, one of our staff was bombarded with ads on Facebook for shaving products. She was the only one with Facebook on her phone everyone else had removed it.’Mr Sartori warned that this is one way free apps could make money – by selling data about their users to advertisers. He said: ‘It would explain how these social-media platforms are able to come up with adverts after we have spoken.’But if our private lives are being used for advertising, what else is being monitored? Interestingly, none of the experts believe the social media companies are acting with malicious intent.At the moment, we have no way of knowing for sure. And it is worrying to realise just how easily we may have opened ourselves up to being exploited for profit.David Emm, principal security researcher at international cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab, offered reassurance.He said that there is not someone listening to our every word and that it is not possible for a device to determine who said what – just that the word or phrase was used by someone within earshot of the phone.But he warned: ‘People should think more about what they download on their phones and remember that nothing is free. There are just different ways of paying.’Of course, our phones are not the only devices with microphones or built-in cameras. Our other ‘smart’ household devices – designed to make modern life more efficient – may have a darker side, too.From TVs and Alexa assistants to baby monitors, fridges and smart meters, reports have shown that such gadgets have the ability to record people without their permission.I decided to ask Siri, the personal assistant app on my phone, outright whether he (or she) was listening to my conversations.‘Hey Siri,’ I say.‘I’m here,’ it replies.‘Have you been listening to my conversations?’ I ask.‘I’m not sure I understand,’ Siri replies, defensively.‘Have you been spying on me?’ Siri knows what to say – almost as if it had been pre-programmed: ‘Nope. Are you sure you haven’t been spying on me?’It has all the hallmarks of a modern spy thriller – only this one feels rather too real for comfort. "},{"url":null,"title":"Beloved green used families council chiefs want turn car park","story":"    Hands off our green: Campaigners are fighting to stop the popular park in Loughton, Essex from being built onHeartbroken elderly couple are forced to watch as their...US millionaire boldly goes for new £130m classic car museum...For cod\u0027s sake, not another chippy!

I was confident that my Cleethorpes constituency would vote to leave and they duly delivered by 70 per cent to 30.When I arrived in Westminster nine years ago I joined the European Research Group (ERG) and have consistently voted first to achieve a referendum and subsequently to deliver the most robust version of Brexit possible.My vision for Brexit was spelled out almost exactly by the Prime Minister in her Lancaster House speech where she outlined the following objectives: taking back control of our own laws, control of our borders, and the ability to sign new trade deals around the world.Unfortunately we are now a long way from that vision. The Withdrawal Agreement put to Parliament on 15th January was, as we know, not just defeated but slaughtered by a majority of 230, and yet, bizarre though it may seem, it remains the only deal on the table.The main concern for most MPs centres round the Irish backstop which could lead to Northern Ireland staying in the EU Customs Union, large parts of the single market and governed by EU VAT rules. The backstop could be used by the EU to achieve further concessions from the UK surrounding such areas as access to fishing waters or in relation to Gibraltar.Corbyn attacks First World War commemorations as a \u0027piece of...Woe Jeremy Corbyn: 100 MPs could join Tom Watson\u0027s army as...Share this articleWe should not be afraid to leave without a deal, something confirmed by senior businessmen and women when I attended a dinner arranged by the Hull \u0026amp Humber Chamber of Commerce last Thursday evening.They recognised there were potential problems but could also see opportunities, even without a deal. What a pity so many members of the Government have been silent when it comes to articulating an optimistic vision for a post-Brexit Britain.So where are we now? We are faced with what I trust will be a carefully-crafted, legally binding addition to the Prime Minister’s deal. Labour have already betrayed millions of their voters. We Conservatives must not do the same. Those of us who are passionate Brexiteers must now decide how we ensure we leave, and leave we must on March 29, for if we don’t the Government’s credibility will be in tatters.The Remainers in Parliament have undermined our negotiating position at every opportunity.    Mr Vickers said: \u0027Sadly, I cannot see how we can achieve Brexit other than by supporting a revised version of the PM’s deal\u0027Of course ‘no deal’ should remain on the table, but the PM has been forced to put that to a parliamentary vote if she fails to get a deal through and it’s almost certain parliament will vote to further weaken our negotiating position. So much for honouring the referendum result.Sadly, I cannot see how we can achieve Brexit other than by supporting a revised version of the PM’s deal as described above.If we can reach a compromise on the backstop we have to accept the reality that this is the best we can get otherwise we could end up in a deal that prevents us from implementing trade deals, having to keep free movement or, perish the thought, remaining an EU member.If the Prime Minister can achieve this, then I believe she will find that the majority of the Commons will support her deal.

The approach mirrors that adopted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children, George, five, Charlotte, three, and Louis, ten months.They later appointed Maria Borrallo, a graduate of the prestigious Norland College, when George was a few months old, although it is understood that Meghan may bring in a nanny when her child is younger than that.Last night Norland College declined to say if they had been approached by the couple.It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three children.          It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three childrenWhile Meghan will take formal maternity leave and is unlikely to attend public engagements, she is determined to remain active behind the scenes working for her various causes. But a source said: ‘This is her first baby and there will be a certain degree of playing it by ear.’In January, Meghan became patron of the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the animal welfare charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get jobs.She will this week join a panel including singer Annie Lennox and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to mark International Women’s Day, where they will discus issues such as ‘access to education and limitations in employment’.Meanwhile, builders have been working feverishly to complete the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Home Park, Windsor. Harry and Meghan hope to move to the Grade II listed property from Kensington Palace within the next three weeks.The move may mean that Meghan chooses not to give birth at the Lindo Wing, the exclusive maternity ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Central London where the Duchess of Cambridge had her three children, but instead use a hospital ‘closer to home’.One option would be Frimley Park Hospital in Berkshire, which is about 15 miles from Windsor and where the Countess of Wessex had her children. It comes amid reports Meghan and Harry are considering raising their child \u0027gender neutral\u0027 – understood to mean they will not enforce any male or female stereotypes.        Gender neutral:  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be looking at bring up their child without gender stereotypes According to a source, who has known the Duchess for many years and was at her wedding: \u0027Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby.\u0027She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won\u0027t be imposing any stereotypes.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the couple could choose to forgo traditional blues and pinks to match the baby\u0027s gender. They could also avoid conventional gender-biased toys such as dolls for girls and train sets for boys.Last night a senior Kensington Palace aide refused to rule out the possibility of the baby being raised gender neutral.       Gone with traditional: Meghan pictured meeting youngsters on a recent trip to Morocco will do away with blue and pink colour schemes and would not wish them to be surrounded with conventional toys            Keeping quiet: Kensington Palace have refused to comment on plans to bring up the baby gender fluid The couple are understood to have chosen neutral grey and white hues for the nursery, rather than the blue or pink.Meghan has transformed her husband in many ways: Harry has given up alcohol in solidarity with his pregnant wife, quit smoking and recently revealed he starts the day by meditating. But the Duke is still very much a traditionalist at heart. He has continued his passion for hunting and shooting despite Meghan\u0027s love for animals.And as a young boy, he was always running around Highgrove in military fatigues, climbing trees and playing toy soldiers with Prince William.Meghan has also revealed she played with dolls as a child.A spokesman for Kensington Palace last night said: \u0027The Duke and Duchess are extremely excited to welcome their first child in the spring.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Men twice likely spray tan night women likely buy outfit","story":"    It\u0027s a beauty treatment you might expect many women to book up before a big night outIt\u0027s a beauty treatment you might expect many women to book up before a big night out.But image-conscious men are almost twice as likely as women to get a spray tan before an evening out, according to a new study.The survey found that 21 per cent of men usually get an instant tan ahead of a big night, while only 12 per cent of women would do the same. Men are also more likely to get their hair styled before a night out, with 42 per cent visiting the hairdresser, while only 28 per cent of women do.Women, however, are more likely to buy a new outfit for a night out, with 37 per cent trawling the shops, compared to 22 per cent of men.Worryingly, the study found that 70 per cent of men and 60 per cent of women feel social media pressure to spend more than they can afford on clothes and smart cars.Headteacher of a leading comprehensive school bans fake tan...\u0027I just had a look at your Instagram... what size are you?\u0027...Share this articleThe study, by banking app U Account, revealed that those aged 25 to 34 spend the most on luxuries – an average of £400 a month – with 18 to 24s spending £280 a month and 35 to 45s £190. "},{"url":null,"title":"Graphic novelist ordered pay 41m family fiancee scalped brutal slaying","story":"Blake Leibel was told he must give Iana Kasian\u0027s family $41.6 million.

If there is a vote on the 12th and it takes two months to carry out the procedure, it would be justified.\u0027Mrs May has said that if her deal is rejected by Parliament, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, and if that is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit for a limited period.Prisons minister Rory Stewart warned today that a failure to back Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal would leave the UK in a \u0027zombie world\u0027.He told Sky\u0027s Ridge on Sunday: \u0027All those other options are worse than the PM\u0027s deal and I hope people are focusing on this.\u0027Because if you think that through, extension to Article 50, which is going to be a vote which would effectively give lets say a couple of month\u0027s extension, would resolve nothing.\u0027It would put us in a world in which we were still in a zombie world, not knowing where we were going.\u0027And it would increase the chance of other options.

Would he be interested, they asked, in moving to Manhattan to run an as yet unbuilt arts centre, to which $75m (£57m) in public money had been committed but for which, at that stage, there were no offices, no staff, no website, no bank account and no mission, beyond that of creating something that was “unlike anything else in New York”? A blank space, in other words, and “terrifying”, says Poots, which is why his instinct was to jump and say yes. “There’s that quote: if you’re not in over your head, how will you ever find out how tall you are?”Five years later, we are in the offices of what, this April, is going to open as the Shed, the largest new art space to have opened in New York since the Lincoln Center in 1962. Since being hired, Poots and his board have raised half-a-billion dollars in private funding and doubled the scale of the Shed so that, when it opens this spring with a programme of original commissions including works by Steve McQueen and Björk, it will be in a multistorey glass complex where the largest performance space can accommodate up to 1,200 people. There will be rehearsal and lab spaces for emerging artists, a pop-up bookshop and a 20,000 sq ft outdoor plaza for huge events. Behind all of this will be Poots who, at 52, has the kinetic energy of someone staring down an extremely short deadline and asks the central question of any public art space: “Who is it for?”A quick way to answer this is to revisit one of the small, pivotal disagreements Poots had with the original concept for the Shed when he signed on in 2014. At that point, it existed largely as the brainchild of Daniel Doctoroff, at the time deputy mayor of New York under Michael Bloomberg, who came up with the idea of a spectacularly funded arts space to be built alongside Hudson Yards, a luxury housing development on the west side of Manhattan that was attracting criticism as yet another of the city’s gifts to the rich. The Culture Shed, as it was then called, would be built on public land as a way of broadening the scope of the overall development.All of which sounded great to Poots, with the exception of the name. “I didn’t like the sound of it,” he says. “Culture Shed – it sounded a bit preachy.” He called a friend, one of the creative directors at Framestore, the company responsible for the CGI sequences in the Alfonso Cuarón film, Gravity. “And he said, ‘Why would you call it Culture Shed? It’s like a soap opera putting on a laugh track to tell your dumb audience when to laugh.’” Then he called Marina Abramovic, who in her inimitable style said: “Why call it that? When they made Apple, they didn’t call it the Apple Computer.”Finally, Poots went back to the board and suggested dropping “culture” from the title and just calling it the Shed. “I liked the idea of the Shed because it’s where you make things,” he said. Plus, “it would’ve been shortened anyway, like the Met, so you may as well save on rebranding costs in three years’ time.”The point about all this is that Poots wanted to signal, from the name down, that this was not a conventional museum or a gatekeeper to high culture. It would not house a permanent collection, nor would it stage revivals of existing works. It was a radical new space for work across all disciplines, “a commissioning centre for all arts”, which, in New York at least, had never been done before, with an emphasis on emerging talent. The inaugural show will be a five-night concert series called Soundtrack of America, a celebration of African American music directed by McQueen, but featuring largely unknown musicians. “We’re launching a half-a-billion dollar arts facility with unknown, early-career African American talent.”If anyone can democratise access to the arts it is Poots, whose work as an impresario goes back to his early 20s, when he played trumpet in a band and, with the canny eye he would later bring to multimillion dollar shows, told the band leader after a single rehearsal: “This band could be better and I should start by firing myself.” It was his short-lived career as a trumpet player that laid the foundations for everything that came after, teaching Poots to be suspicious of the conventional hierarchies between high and low art, and before that, while he was still a schoolboy in Edinburgh, suggesting to him he could actually be good at something.“I was really painfully average at everything else,” he says, whose Irish father was a dentist and French mother a teacher. “None of it interested me. But I had this thing – I was able to play the trumpet really well – and if I hadn’t had that, I’d probably be on the scrapheap somewhere.”He trained classically, but started doing jazz and pop from an early age. “Subconsciously, I had the feeling, ‘Why is it when I go out and play pop, it’s second-class music, even though sometimes when I play it, I’m playing better than I ever have? But when I go out and do a classical thing, that’s like the pillar of everything, whether I’ve played well or not?’ That has definitely informed everything I’ve done.”For a while, Poots thought he might become a professional musician. Then, one night in his early 20s, he had a sobering experience after performing in a production of Verdi’s Requiem in Edinburgh. “I was doing the offstage trumpet part, where you do nothing for most of the production, then play for about three minutes and go home. It’s highly stressful and I had a dream that night, in which I was doing Verdi’s Requiem but I was 50 – the age I am now. And the thing that woke me up in a cold sweat was that it wasn’t quite as good as when I was 20.”For the next 10 years, Poots worked his way through the major institutions of British culture, starting at the Barbican as a curator and moving on to oversee projects with David Brook at Channel 4 and Nick Serota at the Tate, including a series called Tate Live, his first real foray into visual art, in which he worked with McQueen, Wolfgang Tillmans and Arvo Pärt. He was very good at creating events that generated publicity but which occasionally backfired. In 2001, Poots came up with the first Fatboy Slim concert on Brighton beach – “I remember pitching that idea to Norman” – to which tens of thousands turned up, causing chaos and dominating headlines.He was also very good at dismantling traditional barriers between the arts. In 2005, when Poots was appointed as artistic director of the inaugural Manchester international festival, he wanted to celebrate the city’s roots as the first modern industrial centre by investing in wholly new projects. One of the breakout successes in Manchester was Monkey: Journey to the West, a pop opera collaboration between Damon Albarn’s band Gorillaz and the director Chen Shi-Zheng, a stage production with an anarchic circus-like feel to it and an electric energy. “He’s constantly challenging you by putting different kinds of creative forces together the kind of thing nobody would think of doing, but he does,” says Chen, whose new show, Dragon Spring Phoenix Rise, is in the opening lineup for the Shed. When Poots first approached Chen with the idea of creating an opera in Manchester, they cycled through scores of potential music collaborators until Poots suggested Gorillaz. “He showed me their video and their songs, and I immediately fell for it. I thought this would work.”Chen’s new show is styled as a “futuristic kung fu musical” and written with Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, creators of the Kung Fu Panda movie franchise, and would have been impossible to stage anywhere else, he says. The liberating thing about the Shed is that it marries Poots’s vision to a flexible performance space, in which the walls can retract and the audience can be moved around. “Directors are always trying to destroy the proscenium theatre, to expand, come out, extend and come closer to the audience,” says Poots. “A new space gives new opportunities for your art form. Now we have that.”Among other startling collaborations in the Shed’s opening schedule will be the dramatic work Norma Jeane Baker of Troy, written by the poet Anne Carson and starring Ben Whishaw and Renée Fleming (Carson wrote it specifically with Whishaw in mind and after reading the script he jumped at it). The painter Gerhard Richter will collaborate with the composer Steve Reich for an immersive live performance.One of the most exciting events will be the Shed’s opening show, Soundtrack of America, devised and directed by McQueen and with a creative team including Quincy Jones. As Poots says: “I don’t think anyone can disagree that African American music is the most influential art form of the past 100 years. I don’t think even film goes as deep and as far as this.” Each night, a handful of artists will trace the roots of their own music back through the genealogy of African American music and, after performing that journey, “will end with their song”.McQueen and Poots have known each other for almost 20 years in fact, it was McQueen who introduced Poots to his wife, Kathryn Spellman, a visiting sociology professor at Columbia University. “What I like about Alex,” says McQueen, “is that he says ‘let’s do it’. In the UK, it’s often about making do, or being told we can’t do that. But he says ‘let’s do it’ and that mentality is very similar to mine.”The word “relevance” can be deadly to any artistic production, but Poots is keen for younger audiences, in particular, to have a sense of the impact of how obscure or abstract works can resonate in the real world. He cites Henry David Thoreau’s essay, Civil Disobedience, written in 1849, “which goes on decades later to inspire Mandela, and Martin Luther King. What very few people know was that Thoreau was inspired by a 13th-century poet from Persia, called Saadi of Shiraz. So you can say to a bunch of kids: ‘Who says that art doesn’t have the power to influence changing society? Here’s a really good example.’”The education and involvement of young people is one of Poots’s primary ambitions for the Shed. He talks with frustration about his experience of education departments at many cultural centres in the UK, which, he says, have tended to be “the poor relation”. “It was the thing you put at the end of the corridor to satisfy the Arts Council. And I thought, ‘Can’t we do better?’ I wanted the Shed to have the widest civic responsibility, to go beyond being a space that commissions work for the public.”To this end, he sat down with Tamara McCaw, the Shed’s chief civic programme officer, and came up with one of the opening programme’s most radical commissions, involving three years of work in local schools and building on foundations laid down by Poots during the three years he was director of the Park Avenue Armory. It is called Maze and features a dance company led by Reggie Gray and made up of dancers, spotted and trained via the Shed’s FlexNYC programme, from low‑income neighbourhoods across the city.What is extraordinary about this show is the way Poots and McCaw have devised it as a sort of self-perpetuating commission. “Tamara said, ‘Why don’t we make a programme that is three-dimensional, so that the kids become teachers? Because they can do it already and they teach other kids in the community for free. So why don’t we formalise it: pay them for it, train them, almost become their company management, and make that part of the commission?’ That’s a project and kids in three years will be able to learn flex and join the company.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a60095c4e0e4fa970a98c8cb4e47b5159e4f25/0_177_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=166b706916ae9465d6ec8f2adbc3b58d","title":"big picture surreal portrait iranian desert gohar dashti","story":"Gohar Dashti’s take on the aftermath of the Iran‑Iraq war captures her nation’s ongoing sense of traumaThe photographer Gohar Dashti was born in 1980 in Ahvaz, a city in south-west Iran, near the border with Iraq. For the first 10 years of her life, her home was a battlefield in the brutal war between the neighbouring states. She spent many childhood nights in an air-raid shelter and she looked on as the place that was all she knew was reduced to rubble. Dashti’s work has always focused on the legacy of conflict, a fallout that continues around Ahvaz both physically – the rivers are poisoned, the wheat fields barren – and psychologically.From her earliest work a decade ago, Dashti has approached this post-conflict history not as a documentary photographer, but as a conceptual artist. She grew sick, she has said, of foreign photojournalism – women in chadors brandishing machine guns. Instead, she wanted to use her pictures to locate the more intractable insecurity that she recognised all around her. She started staging pictures that juxtaposed the expectations of normal life events – celebrations of weddings or birthdays – with the ever-present detritus of war.In the series of pictures she called Stateless, made in 2014 and 2015, she developed this idea with surreal portraits in the Iranian desert. The pictures were intended as metaphors of her country’s ongoing trauma for the million Iranian lives lost in the conflict, but also those millions more who have been displaced in the region’s subsequent wars – Iran has accepted more than 950,000 refugees in recent years, mostly from Afghanistan. This picture – a couple clinging to each other with all their worldly goods exposed under the hot sun – is emblematic of that latter reality: “Sky becomes the ceiling and mountains the walls of their new home,” Dashti says, “because nature is the only place that shelters these people, an everlasting refuge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d1e3b43eb348256631facf9addb33d22d22f1d1/733_464_4595_2757/master/4595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ec431a4b82d3fd4008b8c253ef3b8b","title":"henry moore helmet heads go on show together for first time wallace collection","story":"Wallace Collection shows sculptures alongside the armour that inspired themHenry Moore’s celebrated series of helmet head sculptures, which he made sporadically over three decades, will this week be exhibited together for the first and probably only time.The group of seven works will go on display at the Wallace Collection in London for a groundbreaking exhibition that explores the artist’s fascination with armour and reveals how much how it fed his imagination and inspired his work.As one of the 20th century’s greatest sculptors, Moore has been endlessly analysed, studied and theorised about by art historians. There is, however, still more to learn, the curators of the new show say.The artist made many visits to the Wallace Collection in the 1920s and 1930s. While most people go for the jaw-dropping art collection, Moore lingered over helmets and armour.“It is kind of remarkable,” said the show’s curator, Hannah Higham. “That in all the many, many volumes of Moore scholarship … no one has actually looked at a Wallace Collection helmet and gone ‘this face opening looks just like that sculpture’.“This exhibition is never likely to happen again. This is the only place you are going to see it.”The show is a collaboration between the Wallace and the Henry Moore Foundation, and has been talked about for a number of years.The Wallace Collection’s director, Xavier Bray, also said it was curious that the subject had not been explored before, and that he hoped the project would show the power of exhibitions. “You see one thing and it helps you understand that, you see another and it helps you understand this. To me that is why exhibitions have to happen.”The show includes some of the items that inspired Moore, from an ancient Corinthian helmet to a magnificent full set of armour made for a member of the court of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, who ruled at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. Moore saw it less armour, more as sculpture.The series of numbered helmet heads are the show stopper at the end of the exhibition. The first was made in 1950 and the seventh in 1975. They can arguably be interpreted as Moore’s expressions of anxiety or hope over world events.He became a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958 and produced Helmet Head No.3 shortly afterwards. He made the sixth and seventh in 1975, the year democracy was restored in Spain after Franco’s death and the Vietnam war came to an end.Higham said: “If you plot the production of the helmet heads against world events you get quite a clear correspondence between them and moments of conflict.”Bray views Moore’s helmet works as an artistic cry for peace in a turbulent world. “His interest in armour reflect his preoccupation with the universal themes of war and peace, which have renewed relevance for contemporary audiences,” Bray said.Visitors will doubtless make their own interpretations. “He liked the fact that there was ambiguity about meaning,” said Higham. “He didn’t want to make clear statements. It is up to you to read into them.”The exhibition represents a new chapter in the history of the Wallace, a remarkable collection left to the nation by the widow of Sir Richard Wallace in the 19th century with the condition no work could be loaned. That means people who want to see Frans Hals’ cheery The Laughing Cavalier or Velazquez’s severe The Lady with a Fan in real life have to go to the Wallace.The Moore show is the first charging exhibition it has held in its new expanded exhibition space.“It is about shape and form and experiment and about the way Moore was looking around him and the way he was looking at the Wallace Collection,” said Higham. “Hopefully people will shoot upstairs afterwards and they will look at armour in a whole different way.”Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads is at the Wallace Collection from 6 March to 23 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee759607215be9048550cb3750f4b31a275cef34/0_480_3840_4800/master/3840.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8adf0dea93e927266c1abd2621e071fc 720w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Kim Jong-un’s summit with Donald Trump in Vietnam, demonstrations at the border between Colombia and Venezuela, and Paris fashion week – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffcb2b7951831b4b9ab89d84d2e832da93e8a6d/0_226_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf9091a5abaa219bf619271e77063fb","title":"archbishop says dont be too quick to judge pell but parishioners struggle with faith","story":"As churches around Australia celebrate their first Sunday mass since Pell’s conviction, many parishioners say they are feeling angry and betrayedDespite saying he could not comment “too much” on the conviction of Cardinal George Pell for child sexual abuse, with the matter filed for appeal, the archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, nonetheless urged parishioners not to be “too quick to judge” the disgraced prelate.“If we are too quick to judge we can end up joining the demonisers or the apologists, those baying for blood or those in denial,” he said as he delivered Sunday mass at St Mary’s cathedral. “Our readings remind us that things are not always what they seem that we must look beneath the surface and allow truth and justice to unfold in God’s good time.”Pell, the one-time financial controller of the Vatican and confidant to Pope Francis,was found guilty of one count of sexual penetration of a child and four counts of an indecent act with a child. Many Catholics have been left reeling since the news broke on Tuesday and feeling torn as they attended mass around the country.“It would have been reasonable to stay at home,” Father Andrew Hayes told congregants as he presided over mass at St Mary’s parish in Ararat, a small town 200km west of Melbourne.“I am also ashamed and embarrassed.”Ararat is less than 100km from Ballarat, where Pell was born and later became a parish priest. The towns of Ararat and Ballarat have for decades been grappling with the impact of the notorious paedophile priests who once wreaked harm there. While the Vatican and prominent Australian Catholics have avoided making comment on Pell’s guilt, saying they are awaiting the appeal process, Hayes told parishioners: “The church shouldn’t look like an angry bull, to be stared down. The church should look like Jesus.”Hayes was upfront in confronting the imprisonment of Pell. “This week as we begin mass our Cardinal is in jail, having been found guilty of disgraceful offences against children,” Hayes said.“I am so sorry for what this church has done to you. I am sorry for the abuse by clergy, the lifetimes of torment and the loss of life.”His words may have been of some comfort to Catholics who are victims of abuse, who know people who are, and who are struggling to reconcile their faith with the historical and ongoing failures of the church and its hierarchy to children.Alison Page is one such parishioner who was hurting in the wake of the Pell scandal. She describes herself as a cultural Catholic. She attended mass in a Sydney diocese on Sunday, she said, “very reluctantly and still feeling somewhat nauseous”.“I only attended as I was rostered to take children’s liturgy,” she told  Australia. “I am also a lawyer and child protection investigator having done a lot of work in this area. I feel appalled personally and professionally by what I have learned this week about the Pell case.“Particularly as this will continue to ide opinions until the appeal is heard.”The parish priest addressed the issue in his sermon, she said, noting the church had made mistakes and now needed to focus on and pray for victims. But Page said she had long been sceptical of the church hierarchy and felt it had failed to deal with abuse so far in a way that addressed “the gut-wrenching disappointment, sadness and anger of many of the congregation”.She would continue to attend mass, she said, for family and community reasons.“I am a believer in the teachings of the Gospel and my relationship with God is deeply personal – I have never let the Church’s doctrines interfere with this relationship,” she said. “However, I am not a blind devotee to the church hierarchy and power structure – for this reason, have never been confirmed – I don’t think this makes me any less of a Christian.”Like Page, she told Sky News on Sunday that she had long lost faith in the Catholic church as an institution.“How am I supposed to trust that an institution that has so grotesquely failed to protect children, that has so grotesquely failed to do as Jesus commanded, you know, love the little children and bring them in and care for them, where is God in all of this?,” she said.“Where is God’s mercy, where is God’s love? And where is the church responding to this crisis, as God would ask us to – with mercy, with humility, begging forgiveness, and with real contrition and a resolution to change?“I am not alone in this, there are many Catholics I speak to who really struggle with that, with going to mass, and feeling just angry and betrayed while they’re there, about where their institution is.”In Canberra, associate professor Dominic O’Sullivan plans to attend Sunday evening mass at St Michael’s in Kaleen. He said he felt “deeply sad” for victims, and that needed to be the focus going forward.“People take that very seriously, and there’s also perhaps a view that people would like for the allegations to be untrue. That perhaps explains the sympathy but doesn’t mean he is innocent or that he has been the subject of a witch hunt. One has to distinguish between what one would want to be true and what is true.”O’Sullivan said despite those sinners he would keep his faith, which he described as based on his relationship with God, not people.“The church is a community of sinners and people do depart from church values,” he said. “Pell’s an example of that. It’s very sad and it’s very distressing, but it’s no reason for me to stop believing in God.”Marten Koomen attended mass at the church where Pell, then the archbishop of Melbourne, abused two 13-year-old choirboys – St Patrick’s cathedral in Melbourne. Koomen says he is not a devout or institutional Catholic but says he finds great comfort in remembering his deceased aunty and parents, as well as friends, during the services.He said the archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, did address child sexual abuse on Sunday in a sermon that was “full of contrition” and where attendance numbers did not to seem up or down.“Of course listening to him you don’t know whether he’s had media advice or if it comes from a genuine spiritual place, I am a bit sceptical,” he says. “I’m progressive and ultimately the law has to transcend the church. But he spoke about the shame of the church, and that was welcoming.”At St Joseph’s Catholic church in Brunswick West, Victoria, parishioners were reluctant to share their thoughts with  Australia as they entered the building for mass. “It makes no difference to me,” one man said of Pell’s conviction.Another parishioner, who did not wish to be named, said she had read “everything” about Pell’s conviction including the many pieces supporting him and claiming he was wrongfully convicted. She said commentators should leave the case to the legal system.“I’m shocked at the events,” she said. “I think as a church we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, and our work now is to care for the victims.”She said she was coping with the scandal and maintaining her faith by focusing on her relationship with God.“If you have a strong faith and follow the message of Jesus Christ, then you just keep on focusing on that despite the struggles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bdae5cd1ce3cf788429d38d53f2f6221be84e2/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd389641fb60b3573fe3c3960b55dc7","title":"sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras in pictures","story":"A selection of images from the 41st annual parade, the theme of which was ‘fearless’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dad223fce84226a77ae15e11371fb24e5ff90db/0_2206_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4597f3f8964e1ec91db37b4922f72355","title":"siri hustvedt i am writing for my life memories of the future interview","story":"She has spent her life carving out a career as a writer of intellect in a world still dominated by men. Here, Siri Hustvedt talks about magic tricks, why you can’t trust an author – and seeing herself as ‘ridiculous’Siri Hustvedt is laughing. “I feel so much urgency,” she says, her long legs folded beneath her on an armchair. We are on the ground floor of the Brooklyn brownstone she shares with her husband, Paul Auster. The room is decorated with paintings of typewriters. There is a vase of fresh flowers. Hustvedt, who has just published her seventh novel, Memories of the Future, is figuring out which of her many projects to tackle next. “I want to write another novel, but I also want to write this philosophical book, and I have many, many essays now that I should put together in another collection.” A day earlier she’d given a eulogy for an old friend, the American magician Ricky Jay. “I was talking to two people I know, both at least as old as I am, and I was asking what they were doing, and they were both saying, ‘Well, we’re not doing that much at the moment,’ and I just said, ‘You know, I’m working for my life.’” She drops her voice to a whisper: “I’m a little nuts, I am working like a maniac to get it in before I die.”Her days start early, at 5.30am with some meditation she is at her desk by 7am. “Morning brain is the best brain,” she says cheerfully. “I can feel my sharpness declining after six or seven hours.” Hustvedt spends the afternoons reading, mostly academic papers that form the basis of her many lectures on neurology and psychology. She and Auster have been married for 38 years, and still read aloud to each other. They are great lovers of fairytales, as is their 31-year-old daughter, Sophie, a singer of slinky, soulful pop songs. There are other writer couples, of course, but few that have stayed together so long. “I remember we bought this house many years ago,” Hustvedt says, wistfully. “We walked in the door and Paul looked at me, and he said, ‘Not bad for a couple of poets’.” Like a fantasy of the novelist’s life made flesh, one pictures the couple working away on their manuscripts, and then coming together for dinner, before settling in to watch a movie. “We have one of those DVD things,” Hustvedt says. “We are partial to movies from the 1930s. There’s an energy to those films, and also the roles for women are infinitely better.” As a history student at St Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, she saw Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in George Cukor’s Holiday, and remembers being blown away. “I was Katharine Hepburn for an hour and a half,” she said. “She was the outsider in that film.”As an actor, Hepburn was often accused of being austere and haughty, in some ineffable way not “feminine” enough. “I never realised until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex,” she once quipped. Hustvedt has often found herself pushing back against the same prejudice, a result she thinks of the way arts are seen as inherently feminine, soft, imaginary, and unserious. “A male novelist hardens and dignifies the form, while a female novelist is doubly penalised as a woman working in an unserious form,” she says. The distinction, she thinks, may explain why male writers have an equal number of men and women readers, while female writers are read primarily by women. Hustvedt’s 2014 novel, The Blazing World, longlisted for the Man Booker prize, was a kind of revenge fantasy in which she imagined a marginalised female sculptor, Harriet “Harry” Burden, playing an elaborate trick on the art world by persuading three male contemporaries to present her work under their names to show how gender, not talent, was the industry’s yardstick.At the memorial service for Ricky Jay, Hustvedt had addressed the challenges of her own life as an intellectual woman in a misogynistic society. “I gave a rather forceful speech, saying that, as a woman, and worse as an intellectual woman, and even worse as an intellectual woman writer married to a man writer of some note, I have negotiated social spaces with an earned cynicism from facing lordly condescension, instant dismissal, and long lectures on subjects that I have been studying for years.” The point of the speech was to emphasise a singular quality of her late friend. “He knew all about prejudgment, and people seeing what they expect to see, because that’s what magic is about,” says Hustvedt. “And I ended up saying that because he knew all about this, he was free of it.”Hustvedt was 13 when she got the writing bug. Her father, a professor of Norwegian, had taken his wife and four daughters with him to Reykjavík, where he was studying the Icelandic sagas. They would drive around squashed into a Volkswagen Beetle, while their father would gesture to random spots, and shout things like, “And this is where Snorri died,” before heading to the next landmark. “It was perpetually light because it was the summer, and I couldn’t sleep, for the first time in my life,” Hustvedt recalls. “My circadian rhythms were completely screwed, so I just stayed up and read.” She was graduating from children’s books to what she calls “little print”, and immersed herself in the classics. She read an abridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo and barely stirred through its 800-odd pages. But one book, in particular, stood out. “I was so moved by David Copperfield, the horrible stuff about Mr Murdstone, and Peggotty, and Aunt Betsey, and the blacking factory, the horrors of all of it. I remember walking to the window, looking out at the creepy, little city of Reykjavík and thinking, ‘If this is what books are, this is what I’m going to do.’” She began writing that year. The fact that Copperfield is memoir dressed up as fiction was evidently not lost on her.Memories of the Future is a Pandora’s box of ideas within ideas, but principal among them is the question of whether we should take a memoir at its word. We get a warning early in the novel: “If you are one of those readers who relishes memoirs filled with impossibly specific memories, I have this to say: those authors who claim perfect recall of their hash browns decades later are not to be trusted.” Readers of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s six volumes of memoir, My Life, with their endless descriptions of routine chores, may take note. “Many successful memoirs have dialogues that goes on for page after page after page, dialogue that nobody could possibly remember, unless you are a savant of some kind,” Hustvedt says. “And that’s extremely rare, so what are we talking about? You can’t possibly believe the memoir writers have that kind of memory.”While memoir is too conventional to interest Hustvedt, memories do make their way into her novel in which a protagonist by the initials of SH shares much, but not all, of the writer’s biography. Like SH, Hustvedt really did see the great poet John Ashbery reading in Greenwich Village at the Ear Inn a tin of Campbell’s soup really did roll under the seats of the auditorium during a lecture on Shelley and Rousseau by the since-discredited and now long-dead academic Paul de Man. On the other hand, Hustvedt did not live next to a witches’ coven. And although she was near-broke and hungry for a period, she was never reduced, as SH is, to lifting a cheese sandwich from a rubbish bin. “The poverty stuff is not exaggerated,” says Hustvedt. “I didn’t have enough money to get by, and I think about this with a kind of amazement now, but, like SH, I was too proud to ask.” She recalls being so pale with hunger that a professor eventually urged her to visit the university office and ask for an emergency loan. “It saved my life,” she says. “I got $200, and they didn’t ask me to pay it back.”Hustvedt’s novel evokes a New York that has vanished, a city that feels both smaller and shabbier, yet also richer, with an intellectual life that no longer feels plausible in the suburbanised city of today, in which public spaces have eroded and people gather in cafés not to debate ideas, but to plug in. But the city has become safer. A pivotal scene in Memories of the Future culminates in an attempted rape. Nothing quite so terrible happened to Hustvedt, although she bore her share of horrors. “I was never mugged, but I was molested on the subway, someone grabbed my genitals,” she replies matter-of-factly. “I actually did get my elbow into his side before he left the train, and he cried out, which was extremely gratifying.” She also recalls being handed a whistle at Columbia University library after reports of a flasher lurking among the shelves, a precaution she finds hysterical today.Sometimes Hustvedt wonders if her compulsion to write is neurological. She thinks a lot about the Danish philosopher and poet Søren Kierkegaard, who may have had temporal lobe epilepsy. “This man wrote 7,000 pages in a journal, and that’s not including his many books, and he died in his 40s,” she says. “Without my strangenesses, I might not have become a writer, so as with many afflictions sometimes there are reasons to celebrate.” By “strangenesses” Hustvedt is referring to a history of crippling migraines, one of which lasted a year, and that started during her honeymoon. “I had a seizure that threw me against the wall, my arm went up in the air, and then I had auras, uncanny clarity of vision and then the crash and the pain,” she says. “I still have them, but not nearly so often, and I control them with deep meditation.” In 2009, she published a well-received book, The Shaking Woman, about another neurological condition that she first experienced in 2007 when she found herself shaking uncontrollably as she gave a eulogy for her father. The shaking recurred on subsequent public engagements, and she now takes Propranolol, a beta blocker that seems to keep things in check. “I’m usually most interested in myself as somehow an object of study,” she says wryly. “Generally, it takes the form of seeing myself as ridiculous. And that is very helpful, on the road of life, to put things in a certain perspective.”Hustvedt lives so deeply in the world of ideas that it can be hard to keep pace with her thoughts, but there is no pretension in what she says, because none of it is said for effect. She has spent her life carving out a career as a writer of intellect in a field where that distinction is still largely claimed for men. Reversing that double standard is a kind of mission. “Over the years, I have found myself deeply amused by enthusiastic responses to high-flown allusions, intellectual references, and complex forms in books by man novelists as signs of their cleverness and genius and the denigration or ignoring of the same play in works by women,” she says. In an email sent after we parted, she reminds me of a line in Memories of the Future, in which one character advises another: “Remember this: the world loves powerful men and hates powerful women. I know. Believe me, I know. The world will punish you, but you must hold fast.”Behind the facade of a townhouse that sits just south of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, Hustvedt is holding fast.Memories of the Future by Siri Hustvedt is published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton at £18.99 on 19 March.

While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images. We looked at each one, and although we couldn’t include them all we were hugely heartened by your passion and knowledge.

In 2017, we were all elected on a brilliant, radical manifesto, and as members of the largest left-of-centre party in Europe. We also need to be honest about the fact that Brexit has posed a serious challenge to the unity and political integrity of the Labour movement. That is why the shift we have seen from the Labour leadership towards backing a final say is so vital if we are to continue to inspire millions of people and deliver the social and economic agenda that we have promised.Brexit was always a Tory project, and this is the Tories’ mess. But our approach to Brexit cannot just be a question of competence or parliamentary footwork. It must be rooted in an understanding of what Brexit is really about - boosting nationalism, scrapping regulations and blaming immigrants for a social crisis which is really the result of rightwing economic policy. Brexit won’t just destroy jobs and harm the communities we represent it is also a crucial point of reference for the rise of the far right globally.If Labour had failed to stand up to this agenda, we would have faced ruin, with a demoralised activist and voter base. Now that we are backing a final say, we have a chance to turn these problems on their head. It is failed politics, where people across our communities have been ignored, that has created this ided society. With a different politics, we can return to the mass enthusiasm and people-powered politics that drove the Corbyn surge of 2015.To rise to this challenge, Labour will have to do far more than vote the right way. We must campaign wholeheartedly and with radical politics at the front of our case, as many trade unions already are. We will need the Labour movement to mobilise and fight for the right of the British people to have the final say, just as union members get to vote on the deals negotiated by their leadership.Labour is not arguing for a re-run of the 2016 referendum, but a ratification vote on a specific deal. As John McDonnell has said, Labour is now clear that Remain would be on the ballot paper. The campaign against Brexit needs to start now, and on positive terms which only Labour can deliver. On doorsteps and in communities, we need to launch an insurgent campaign which combines internationalism with a vision for transforming our economy and democracy, and putting power and wealth in the hands of the many, not the few.The EU reflects the political reality of the member states that comprise it, and is far from perfect. We deplore the treatment of Greece by the European institutions, and the fact that tens of thousands of migrants have been left to drown in the Mediterranean Sea. It is precisely because of these criticisms that our movement has a moral duty to stay and fight in the EU, working alongside the European left and using our position as the largest group in the Party of European Socialists. Jeremy Corbyn, and the mass movement underneath him, could yet be a major player in influencing the EU’s policies and development for the decades ahead.Unless we find a way to deliver a just transition to a sustainable economy, not only for Britain but for the entire planet, we face catastrophe. The EU provides a unique international framework to do this. A zero-carbon economy across Europe can go alongside a charter of trade union rights, a tax avoidance crackdown and a massive programme of redistribution, so that we level up rather than racing to the bottom. These are the policies that are required to combat the rise of the far right. We need to build unions, not borders.We share the frustration, and we understand the doubts, of many of our parliamentary colleagues. Labour has heard the cry from Brexit and we must heal the ide. No one would have chosen the situation we are now in. What comes next involves pain, and will require bravery. But we now have an opportunity to defeat Tory Brexit, bring down the government, and rebuild and transform Britain. We must seize it.

Take a look at the recent New York Times piece that says a growing number of wealthy home-buyers are “choosing to live in corporate-branded communities”. Not just any branded communities, mind you, but luxury ones from the likes of Porsche, Armani and Bulgari.While the market is dominated by hotel groups such as Four Seasons, other brands are muscling in. In 2017, the Porsche Design Tower opened in Miami residents of the skyscraper can drive their car straight into their multimillion-dollar apartment. The city, which seems to be the spiritual home of the unimaginably and unimaginatively wealthy, also hosts the Fendi Château and the Armani Residences.If you are feeling impecunious and excluded, you will be cheered to learn that corporate communities are coming to the masses.

Any extension of the article 50 process should be for a reason. It should be to eliminate the blind Brexit Theresa May proposes. But first her deal must be defeated.The Brexiters will fall into line with her deal because they believe they can win the subsequent battle and impose a hard Brexit. The soft Brexit supporters and those who want a fresh referendum should unite to insist Britain knows the direction of its future relationship with Europe before we leave. We have learned a lot during this Brexit debacle. It has been a masterclass in political risk. We are now in a state of confusion, in which even those whose day job is to study the details find it hard to explain.The May deal is bad for one central reason. In the name of resolving the issue so we can move on, it does no such thing. The political declaration is deliberately vague. It is unclear if the framework for the future is hard Brexit, ie a Canada-style conventional free-trade agreement, or soft Brexit, ie a Norway-style arrangement that keeps us in the European trading system of the single market andor the customs union.The difference between the two is fundamental and at the heart of the whole Brexit debate. And they are – with some plus or minus – the only models on offer.The reason for the vagueness of the declaration is that when the PM tried to decide this issue, at Chequers, in favour of soft, it was clear enough for cabinet ministers to resign but insufficiently clear for Europe to accept. So she retreated.Today, the cabinet is split. One half want soft, the other hard. May’s strategy is to maintain ambiguity and essentially say to both sides: keep your powder dry and fight it out after we leave. When she says that an extension of the article 50 process doesn’t of itself resolve the central question, she is right. But neither does her deal. Instead, we are going to pay billions upfront, exit, lose our negotiating leverage and the fight will go on.We are told that this is the only deal on offer, when this is nonsense. Europe would be perfectly happy to amend the future declaration to point in the direction of hard or soft Brexit, should parliament decide it. Then, having decided the guiding principle, the detail would indeed be much easier.This was, after all, what we were promised continually by the PM until she realised she couldn’t do it without destroying what was left of the unity of the Conservative party. The obvious thing is to vote down her deal, vote down no deal, extend the time limit and reach an “in principle” conclusion on hard or soft if neither passes, go back to the people. Alternatively, accept her deal but with the Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum before we implement it. The parameters of hard or soft are well known and a decision on the options could be done even within the timeframe of a short extension. This course is being refused because the PM knows that she would be forced to take a position – the cabinet will split and the Brexiters will wreak further havoc should parliament vote for soft Brexit.It is extraordinary to see how the once strutting Brexiters are so frit of putting their actual hard Brexit proposal to the vote either of parliament or the people before we leave. They fear, rightly, that when the implications of Britain moving to a Canada-style trade relationship with Europe are explicit, the country will recoil. Ultimately, the Brexiters’ strategy will be to get Britain out, remove May, elect a Brexiter to deliver a hard Brexit or possibly fight an election against a weakened Labour party to secure such a mandate. Those who want a soft Brexit, including Labour MPs who may be thinking of backing the deal, would be ill advised, unwittingly, to co-operate with this strategy.For those of us who want to put the matter back to the people, the route to such a decision is through the process of forcing a conclusion to the hard v soft question. Once obliged to choose, MPs will realise either choice is unattractive and the people will understand neither is better than what we have inside Europe now. MPs should think long before agreeing to exit blind. If I were an MP, I would not want to own this putrid potage of poor political leadership and self-destructive consequence.Any extension requires Europe’s agreement. It should agree, but with a condition. The extension should be for a purpose: clarity as to the future framework. That way, the next stage of negotiation will not be a repeat of the last. This is in Europe’s interests. And for sure it is essential to ours.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

On Monday, having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood, teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil’s head.Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil’s ear hair, while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests.Andrew Neil’s head wheat had begun smouldering when he heard that Penny Mordaunt MP had agreed to be filmed for This Week, making the case for Hard Brexit while swimming around a giant floating model of the UK in Liverpool’s Royal Albert Dock.Neil’s morning bisc crown had crumbled during the blaze and so its remains were eaten as a This Week green room snack by Michael Portillo, who lapped up the wheaten fragments with warmed milk from his dish, like a pleased cat.Nonetheless, weather women smiled cheerily on Tuesday as they announced the hottest British February on record. Their happiness perhaps tells you that the so-called “climate change” situation isn’t as serious as the doomsayers and gloom-mongers out there would have us believe. After all, if it really was too hot for the daffodils to survive, wouldn’t they just stay in the ground and wait?Recently, the Times’s Quentin Letts and Julia Hartley-Brewer’s Julia Hartley-Brewer both tweeted, with delight, that they were able to ski across the Swiss border unhindered. This apparently showed that there was no need for a British border in Ireland, because of blah blah blah shit piss wank. It also proved that it can’t be that hot as otherwise there wouldn’t be any snow, which is all made out of coldness, like in Frozen.Some misery-gongers and doom-dongers have even suggested that the late Professor Stephen Hawking’s 2017 warning, that Earth had only 100 more years of habitability, now looks optimistic. But Hawking was a liar, because if the world really was in trouble like how he said it was, then why wouldn’t he of used his mind to invent an invention to mend it?It proved very convenient for the biased Hard Remainiac BBC that this supposed climate emergency emerged last week. It distracts from any positive coverage of their hated Brexit. Indeed, the crisis of democracy in our parliament has barely been talked about since Andrew Neil’s carbohydrate yarmulke combusted on Monday.Instead, all we seemed to hear about all week was the imminence of the climate threat to all life on Earth, the inevitability of major environmental disasters, killing billions, and the need to change immediately to a global zero carbon economy or face mass extinction by the middle of the century.What we should still have been talking about, of course, and at the expense of everything else, for years and years, today and every day, is our membership, or non-membership, of a European trading bloc and how this affects the power bases of the principal political parties in the United Kingdom in the short term. Not the death of all life on Earth.On Monday night, tiny Jeremy Corbyn shifted his two buttocks slightly on his north London fence, the kitten weight of his coddled-egg-nourished frame pivoting slightly towards the possibility of maybe having a second referendum, if Tom Watson and Keir Starmer and the Labour party membership absolutely insist, but not really, obviously.Indeed, the British people’s democratic right to ruin their own country for a generation at least, destroy the livelihoods of their most vulnerable communities and sabotage food and medicine security indefinitely must be respected without question, like an old-fashioned village policeman or a violent Ape-God.By Wednesday, the biased Hard Remainiac BBC had begun looping mobile phone footage of Andrew Neil’s burning cereal hair, including shocking film of Michael Portillo rescuing the charred remnants from a filthy bin with his bare hands in order to make himself his milky treat, even as Alan Johnson tried to hold him back.The scheduling of the controversial hair inferno clip seemed designed to shunt Brexit down the newspipe and to distract from the fact that the promise of finally leaving the hated EU seemed to be slipping from the betrayed British public’s grasp. But there is so much more to be said about Brexit.We need to know the exact terms upon which, in the near future, our scorched nation will be exporting the deformed vegetables retched up from its charred soils to other ruined lands and we need to know the exact levels of violence we are allowed to use to repel economic migrants attempting entry to the UK from soon-to-be-uninhabitable regions of France and Spain.Can a hungry Spaniard be shot or merely punched, as he makes landfall in Dover? What about a Frenchman, desperate for sparkling mineral water and the grapes that will now grow in newly temperate Scotland? Will it be acceptable, under the terms of our future trading arrangements, to force him back from the beach into the sea with a wooden club? Or to poke him with a poisoned spike?Happy about this February summer?

These strange and knobbly vegetables, at their peak in winter and spring, take a little effort to prepare but the results are well worth itWe kept the parsnips over winter in a sack of sand in the outhouse, my dad sending me down to get the long, pale roots on a Sunday morning, so they could be peeled and roasted around the beef. I protested, even though they made a silky mash and a fine soup. We knew nothing of the other pale and interesting winter vegetables – salsify or Jerusalem artichokes, celeriac or kohlrabi – and had no any idea you could eat beetroot without pickling it first.It is odd, sad even, that we have settled for carrots and parsnips when there are so many other root vegetables worth our time. I guess we went for the easy-peel varieties. Salsify, long and elegant, is back in the shops after years in the wilderness. It’s a messy vegetable to deal with, possessing a fine, mineral flavour, that – unlike most of its kind – carries something of an affinity for shellfish. I use it with scallops and cod cheeks. The roots are the devil to wash, and covered in fine, black soil that will get everywhere. They need washing and peeling, though not necessarily in that order. Salsify can be cut into stubby pieces the length of a wine cork, and fried. Butter is its friend, but steam the pieces first then toss them in it, like new potatoes. Better still, after steaming, roll each lump in beaten egg and fresh breadcrumbs, perhaps with a little grated parmesan and chopped parsley. Then fry till crisp.Celeriac is finally having something of a moment. Once you have sliced off its tangle of roots and peeled it, you are left with snow-white flesh that tastes mildly of celery. It can be ushered into a soup with bacon and parsley. You can heroically clear all the stragglers from your veg box in one go by grating it into a crunchy salad with beetroot and kohlrabi. It needs a damn good dressing though. I toss it with a paste of black garlic then marry it with soured cream and crisp, hot pancetta.A word of advice: it is much easier to peel salsify before you wash it.Serves 2Peel the cucumber, cut in half and then in small dice no bigger than a centimetre. Put the cucumber in a small mixing bowl with the white vermouth, the wine vinegar and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Pull the tarragon leaves from their stems and stir into the cucumber then set aside for an hour. Longer will not hurt.Fill a saucepan with cold water then squeeze the lemon into it, adding in the empty lemon shells for good measure. (The more acid the water, the less chance of your salsify discolouring.) Peel and wash the salsify, then cut each root into pieces the length of a wine cork and drop into the cold water.Bring the pan to the boil, then lower the heat, salt lightly, cook the salsify for about 15 minutes, until tender, then drain.Roughly chop the parsley, then stir half of it into the cucumber pickle.Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat then add the drained salsify and cook for a few minutes till lightly and evenly coloured on all sides. As soon as the salsify is golden, add the butter to the pan and let it melt, then, just as it starts to sizzle, pat the scallops dry with kitchen paper and lower them carefully into the pan.

He calls quantum physics his jam, and is a self-taught specialist in the chemical breakdown of food substances by micro-organisms.As the head of fermentation at Noma, Zilber, 33, coaxes new flavors out of jars whose contents are bubbling, rotting and pickling away to introduce at the cult-status Danish establishment (the restaurant was named best restaurant in the world four times, and was re-awarded two Michelin stars last week). Hints of a saffron kombucha he’s working with waft out of the hot chamber, infusing the fermentation lab with south Asian fragrances.Fermentation may currently be enjoying a phase of fascination that cycles through popular culture every few years, but the way Zilber sees it, the practice isn’t making a comeback – it never went away. “It’s always been there. It kept people alive. It served civilization,” he says, sitting in one of the Copenhagen restaurant’s three greenhouses. “I think fermentation is undergoing an understanding.”He’s probably sort of responsible for that, because what comes from Noma is devoured as the gospel. So when Noma’s chef, Rene Redzepi, and Zilber published the Noma Guide to Fermentation last fall, it quickly became a modern edible bacteria bible. Across 100 recipes and nearly 500 pages, the guide covers Noma’s best experiments with seven types of fermentation – lactic acid, kombucha, vinegar, koji, miso, shoyu and garum – all of which make appearances on every dish at the restaurant.“Rene felt a zeitgeist around fermentation and the literature supporting it was lacking, and if any restaurant on Earth was going to be able to speak to it, it was us,” Zilber says.In the guide, they demonstrate how to crank one ingredient out to its punkest form, sometimes with the help of just salt – a technique called lacto-fermentation. The techniques they harness in the lab can  months in the guide they  pages – 14 in the case of the very first recipe, lacto plums – even though it requires just ripe plums and non-iodized salt.A two-page photo grid shows the plums’ evolution as they ferment in a vacuum-sealed bag. By the seventh day they look intergalactic, like 20 suns exploding, but it’s actually just the fruit bursting through loosened skin made to have a “caper-like sharpness” and bathing in its own juice made lemon-sour thanks to fermentation.The plums take five to seven days. The shortest recipe in the guide is for koji – when mold on rice grains or barley converts starch to sugar, contributing “an intense sweetness” – which is ready in two days.A requirement for some recipes that may seem excessive to the humble home cook is a fermentation chamber to control humidity and temperature. In the guide, a photo shows Zilber in an apron, shoulder-length inidual braids gathered into a low ponytail, demonstrating how to build a DIY version with a speed rack, sheet pans and a space heater.“Fermentation is definitely a commitment. It is committing to something. It’s being responsible for life and watching it grow. It’s a slow and patient process,” his Toronto-Canadian roots becoming clear with his pronunciation of the a long “O” in “pro-cess.” “But it’s also being rewarded.”Some recipes require an unusual degree of dedication. The cep shoyu, AKA porcini mushrooms, have to be stirred and tasted every day for the first two weeks, and are only ready to eat about four months after that. The garums, or fish sauces, are ready in about 10 weeks. The hardest concept to grasp about fermentation is the waiting.Ten rooms – some sweet, some sour, some musky and pungent – represent the various transformations of ingredients, expressed by different scents, and provide an ever-evolving pantry for the restaurant. The hot room, kept at 60C (140F), smells like black garlic right now. The miso room smells like ageing miso and other umami-rich caramelized flavors.“Inoculated barley smells like apricots and honeysuckle at 48 hours. It really fills the room,” he says of this finicky form of koji, a closeup photo of which appears in the guide across two pages, resembling a bird’s-eye view of a densely packed wet cotton field.“If you taste the menu, and then you walk into the fermentation lab, into the miso room, and it’s like, ‘Oh, that’s the smell that’s been in my mouth all night’,” he says.Zilber and the four or five other chefs in the lab also just experiment with reactions of food to various applications of fermentation. They tried out wearing white lab coats, like scientists, but quickly scratched that (“It looked like a Colgate commercial where they develop some new teeth whitening,” he says, laughing).“I did some weirrrrd projects,” Zilber says about what helped earn his promotion from chef de partie to director of the lab in 18 months.On Saturdays, Noma’s chefs are invited to present ideas they could see on the menu there. “I would just go completely left field. I’d make dishes of food that required artist’s statements.”His projects developed a reputation for warranting 45-minute debates – like the one where four diners eat the same ingredients prepared and arranged differently and with blinders as an exercise in subjectivity in taste – in place of the usual five-minute critique. “Interns were getting into heated conversations with the head chef about what was food and what was art and that was exactly what I wanted to do.”The first time Redzepi saw one of his projects, Zilber says he looked shocked. “Usually Rene clearly tells you what he likes and doesn’t like. But all he could say was, ‘Well, David, thank you for disrupting projects this week’. I took that as having accomplished something. And all around just being a smartass probably covered the rest.”Smartass in his case means polymath, with some of that encyclopedic databank spilling on to his skin: a tattoo of a map of the solar system within the Milky Way on his right arm, the Schrödinger equation, a description of wave function in physics, on his left.Zilber hasn’t read a novel in 12 years he is “addicted” to non-fiction. He reads during staff meal – “instead of being on Tinder or Instagram”, he says – and just finished The Tangled Tree, a history of how bacteria and horizontal gene transfer upend conceptions of the way species evolve on Earth. He’s currently reading Tamed, a book about the domestication of the 10 most important species to mankind.He relates his fascination with evolution to fermentation: “There are fundamental truths about the way Earth works that absolutely manifest themselves in any facet of life, especially in the wild and chaotic biological ones that you see in fermentation,” he says.“I sneak a little bit of that into the book in the miso chapter, when I equate this Korean idea of son-mat (or hand-taste, meaning each fermenter’s product will taste a bit different each time) to chaos theory. There are parallels between the way fermentation happens and the way the universe happens and I think it’s beautiful,” he says before stopping himself. “Is that too much?”Perhaps, to be in charge of inventing flavors in a lab at one of the most celebrated restaurants in the world is to be consumed by the idea of what else is out there. For Zilber, fermentation is a never-ending exploration.“It’s like poking a hole in a piece of paper and holding it up to the night sky peering through it and being like, aha, the Milky Way. There’s something else out there that’s capable of producing flavors that people have never tasted or imagined before,” he says. “That’s the end game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af24afc674bb822e3e868e103280e83c01d0560/0_239_5523_3314/master/5523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0186b3a4b4fb6132a3495befe4d2b057","title":"yeni london underwhelming dishes and in yer face pricing","story":"Beyond the front of house team, there is little to delight at this modern Turkish newcomerYeni, 55 Beak Street, London W1F 9SH (020 3475 1903). Starters £9-£17. Mains £21-£32. Desserts £9. Wines from £29Following a major car crash, there’s usually an investigation to work out what caused it. Was it driver error? Or perhaps environmental factors? At some point, the people behind Yeni, a newly opened import from Istanbul to London’s Soho, may wish to conduct such an enquiry. Because right now it really is a pile-up the sort that leaves debris scattered across all three lanes, and slows the traffic on the other carriageway to the speed of spilt treacle as they decelerate to get a serious gander.I am going to exonerate the young team working front of house, who deliver both their script and the often calamitous dishes with a touching grace. Also, I have huge respect for the general manager, who retained a certain dignity when the fire alarm went off and continued to roar at us for a good few minutes. Oh, how she punched that number pad, her fingers moving like she was performing a Liszt piano concerto. For us, the siren came between the main course and the dessert. Even someone as godless as I am is allowed to mutter about the possibility of ine intervention. Maybe this alarm would make dinner stop. But we stayed. It’s called commitment. They’re probably wishing we hadn’t.So no, it’s not the staff working the room. Instead, one must look to Turkish star chef and newspaper columnist Civan Er, whose Istanbul restaurant Yeni Lokanta has won many awards, and his business partner Cem Bilge. But I also sense the dead hand of a consultant someone who implored them to bring their faux-rustic schtick to Britain and charge what the hell they like for it, “because those Londoners will swallow anything”. Yeni weds underwhelming, occasionally disastrous dishes with the kind of in-yer-face pricing that gives the entire restaurant business a wretched name.The problem isn’t that we are used, in the UK, to Turkish food being seriously good value, although it usually is. The many smoky grill houses with which the Turkish community has blessed us, heavy with the scent of rendering lamb fat, are a joy. Nor is it that we look to Turkish food for simplicity. During the many summers I spent in Turkey I fell in love with the kebabs and crisp-crusted lahmacun served up at Fethiye’s bus station cafés. Still, there’s always room for a more evolved take on such a culinary tradition. And yes, here’s the dining room for it, with its Aegean turquoise tiling, its hanging globe lamps and its white brick walls which are almost as distressed as we are by the end. The sad thing is, they never do give us anything evolved or erting.Brows start furrowing early when we are told the two of us should order three or four of the starters, mostly priced in the mid-teens, plus two main courses. We are also told “these dishes will arrive one by one”. We are at the mercy of the kitchen. It starts oddly. Turkey has a thrilling way with breads. There are puffed up, sesame seed-crusted flatbreads, and rich, springy oval loaves and more besides. All of that has stayed firmly in Turkey. In common with almost every restaurant surrounding us, they have bought in some serviceable sourdough. We tear at it disconsolately.Now comes an inoffensive taster of a doughy filled dumpling on a yogurt-based sauce dotted with herb oils. It’s a study in beige, and tastes beige too. These tiny dishes are an opportunity to smack us with flavour, to get us excited. Perhaps they don’t want to get our hopes up. For here come wide ribbons of olive oil-braised celeriac. It’s completely fridge cold, and dotted with brutally acidic bits of unadvertised, coagulating sheep’s cheese. It tastes like something left over from the night before, which may just have had its moment 12 hours ago.After a lengthy break in which we are presented with a dish we didn’t order, quickly taken away, we get a small disc of beef tartare for £16, with a potato croquette filled with liquid egg yolk. It might have worked if the beef hadn’t been minced to such a paste it could be embraced by someone without the benefit of their own teeth. Again, it is served overly chilled. A kind of relief comes in a cheery dish of scallops with a spiced carrot purée and a dollop of sprightly herb sauce and walnuts. On the one hand the scallops are well cooked, the sauces engaging. On the other, there are only two scallops and it’s £17.Ah yes, those damn prices. The nadir is the £21 charged for a huge slumping package of muddy-grey vine leaves filled with chickpeas, the sour, bile-ridden tang of labneh and more leaf mulch. I stare at the dish, then mutter to my companion: “We’d better get the vet in that cow’s not right.” We try to eat it, really we do, but it’s less food than a traumatic experience designed to be character forming. It departs the table looking like a rugby field at the end of a vigorous game on a wet winter’s day.Apparently, the star dish is the “roasted beef ribs, isot pepper, cumin, sourdough”. It reads well, as it should for £26. I’ll have to take their word for it on the roasting. What arrives are ravaged strands of the sort that come with long braising, seemingly mixed with quantities of sticky jus. The other flavourings are obscured. Beneath is a tombstone of now soggy bread. It’s a Turkish dish, but one apparently from that bit of Turkey just to the west of the Pennines. It’s the kind of thing a Lancashire pub would slap on the menu for a tenner and for which we’d all applaud. Nobody is clapping now.There are just two desserts: a mediocre salted-caramel panna cotta, and some tiny custard-filled doughnuts, which are fine. Both cost £9, which is not fine. The short wine list has nothing below £29. Bizarrely, despite Turkey having a robust wine sector, there’s just one Turkish bottle, as against three from Greece. I don’t want to stoke tiresome regional animosities but I do wonder what they’d make of that back in Istanbul. The rest of the list, mostly priced at £40 or more, is European. At the end, a fellow diner further along the communal table we are clinging to tells me he reads these reviews and senses, “this one will write itself”. It didn’t. I had to do that. But Yeni provided all the material.Yeni’s arrival fits with the growth in places offering food from around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Yotam Ottolenghi’s Rovi, in Fitzrovia, does it very well, and is bang on trend with both live fire cooking and fermentation. It’s an omnivorous menu but vegetables star. Try the sweetheart cabbage with salted anchovy, and the celeriac shawarma (ottolenghirovi).Carluccio’s is to trial a more ‘formal and premium’ evening service at its branch in Richmond, south London. According to CEO Mark Jones, they will introduce new tableware and up the vegan offering. This follows the closure of 35 sites, under a company voluntary agreement (carluccios).A few Louisiana-influenced restaurants are marking Mardi Gras. Newcomer Bayou Bar in Tooting is holding a crawfish boil on 5 March.

It noted that Duchâtelet’s property had been vandalised and complained of intrusion into his personal life. There was the now‑obligatory mention of “fake news”, referring to one of the stories about the owner’s alleged penny-pinching (namely the rationing of bottled water for players in training sessions), and the killer line was saved for last, having claimed that no foreign investor would possibly want to buy the club and endure the same indignities. “Therefore,” this 668-word piece of tragicomedy concluded, “the owner demands that the EFL acquires his football club.”Well, it’s an idea, I suppose. I particularly like the way he “demands”, rather than simply “requests” or “proposes”, and I hope it is not too impertinent to point out that it is not exactly common practice for a football club to be bought by the league in which it plays. Or, indeed, that he appears to be making an impressive challenge for the 2018-19 trophy as the most preposterous football-club owner in the business.Not that he can be considered the overwhelming favourite just yet when there is so much consistently strong competition elsewhere. Nobody, for starters, could persuade me that any club has had it worse than Coventry City under the hard‑faced ownership of the London-based hedge-fund Sisu and there are plenty of other contenders. At least the supporters of Blackpool are now in a position, finally, to fumigate the corridors of Bloomfield Road and talk of the wretched Owen Oyston in the past tense. Yet it is still very evident that football is awash with clubs where, if you remember the old Monty Python sketch, the people in charge are here on behalf of the Silly party or the Slightly Silly party.Bolton, under the chairmanship of Ken Anderson, have been added to the list this season, especially after the latest reports of staff and players not receiving their wages for February, and Notts County, increasingly, are another one, given the strange set of events that has seen their narcissistic owner, Alan Hardy, take the oldest club in the Football League to 92nd position, accidentally reveal a photograph of his manhood on Twitter, place the club up for sale and invoke the kind of financial chaos that risks them being sent to the knackers’ yard.Hardy made his money at an interiors company called Paragon and, knowing what we do now, that was a curious tweet it put out on 19 January to boast that “we’ve started 2019 on fire” (flame emoji) with £11.7m of new deals in just one week. Back in the real world, Paragon has just gone into administration, putting Notts at significant risk of the same because one appears to be reliant on the other. HMRC, meanwhile, has issued a winding-up petition against the club, to be heard on 10 April. Hardy, to recap, regards Peter Ridsdale, the chairman whose over-spending once prompted the News of the World headline “Post-war Iraq is being better run than Leeds”, as some kind of mentor. Perhaps you can see now why they get on so well.Mostly, I wonder when, or if, the long-suffering fans of Coventry will experience the mix of relief and joy that Blackpool’s supporters will encounter this week now the thousands of boycotters who have stayed away from Bloomfield Road these past few seasons, including distinguished former players such as Tony Green and Eamonn O’Keefe, as well as relatives of the great Stan Mortensen, can look forward to going back, at last.Oyston and his son, Karl, formerly the chairman, did not just bring the town’s football club to its knees, they seemed to take a sinister pleasure from their unpopularity, summed up by Karl driving around the old seaside resort with an OY51 OUT private registration plate. And now, after all the mutiny and boycotts and perhaps the most brilliantly orchestrated and devoted fan protest there has been in English football, Oyston’s time is up. Blackpool’s game against Southend next Saturday will be their first at Bloomfield Road since the fans got their way. Supporters are planning a party, starting with a celebration march from the promenade, and perhaps in some small way it can be a reminder for every other club that has inadequate or reviled owners, that things can change for the better, that it won’t always be one crisis after another, and that one of the reasons why this sport pulls us in, why it is so damn addictive, is that the bad times always make the good ones seem so much better.For now, I imagine that will be only small comfort for the supporters of Coventry when it is apparent now that the nadir of Sisu’s reign might not be, as previously assumed, the year-long exile of “home” games being staged in Northampton, six motorway junctions south.The latest from Coventry is that the league has set a Tuesday deadline to establish where the team will play next season, amid the long-running dispute over rent and other issues with the Ricoh Stadium’s owners, the Premiership rugby club Wasps, and Coventry city council, the freeholder. If nothing materialises, an EGM will be held on 25 April to consider expelling the club from the league. No more Coventry City? It would be nice to think that is an empty threat and the followers of this beleaguered old club can cling to the hope that they, like Blackpool, will come out the other side one day. Yet it is no use just assuming everything will be sorted out. Nobody knows, is the truth.The same applies to Notts but if they can bear to look through the gaps in their fingers across the River Trent they might also remember it is only two years since Fawaz al-Hasawi had turned Nottingham Forest into a shell of a club. Forest’s new owners, in the words of the chairman, Nicholas Randall QC, took over a club “in intensive care”. This season they have had their biggest average crowds since the club’s European Cup-winning days. Season‑ticket prices have been slashed and plans have just been announced to turn the City Ground into the biggest stadium in the east Midlands. The moral of the story: things can improve.As for Charlton, the club’s website contains the minutes of their fans’ forum and – well, everyone loves a trier – De Turck’s attempt to persuade everyone that a takeover by the Football League was the most sensible option. “He said they would pass the Fit and Proper Persons’ test, they understand the monthly losses as they have the financial figures of the club, and they have the football knowhow to run it,” it reports. “The fans’ forum unanimously rejected the proposal saying it was unfeasible.”The other option, perhaps, is that Duchâtelet, who has been trying to flog the club since 2017, drops his asking price, which is clearly scaring off potential buyers, accepts it is the end of an eraerror (delete as applicable) and let’s a proud old club breathe again. Now that would be a cunning plan.Perhaps in time Dario Gradi and those charming people at Crewe Alexandra would be decent enough to furnish us with more details about the reasons he once supplied, in legal documents, for moving Barry Bennell out of the club.“I have only ever sacked one person at Crewe and that was Barry Bennell,” Gradi’s evidence from a civil hearing in 2004, never reported until last week, states. “I ultimately sacked him for failing to accept specific instructions regarding a coaching session on the pitch before a game.”Interesting, that one. Bennell, to recap, was the man they knew at Crewe and, before then, Manchester City as “the starmaker”. He was the talent-spotter who discovered or brought through, among others, David White, Gary Speed, Paul Lake, Andy Hinchcliffe, Ian Brightwell, Steve Redmond, Paul Warhurst, Paul Gerrard, Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Mark Williams. And those are just the ones who went on to win international caps at the various age-levels, even before we get to David Brightwell, Roger Palmer, Gary Blissett and on and on. Just try to think of another man in the modern game who even comes close to such a prolific record – and how coveted that person would be.All of which makes it seem strange that Crewe would sack such a man because of a disagreement over a training session. Not that I would ever doubt Gradi’s evidence, of course, after reading all nine pages of what he had to say. But it certainly must have been serious bearing in mind Bennell was not even sacked after the time he dumped his players in the middle of nowhere to punish them for a poor performance.The story told to this newspaper is that the players were on their way back from a defeat against Manchester United’s youth team and made to get out of their minibus at Beeston Castle, ordered to run around it several times, then told to find their own way home and left to walk, or hitch, the 15 miles back to Crewe (in the days before mobile phones). According to the documents from 2004, a parent complained. Yet neither Gradi nor the chairman, John Bowler, deemed it a sackable offence.Instead, Bennell got the bullet for something that seems entirely more innocuous. What did he do in that training session, as the bibs‑and-cones man, that was so outrageous? What coaching instructions did he fail to carry out? Gradi, reflecting on the one sacking of his long career, does not elaborate. He does not even seem certain which game it involved, recalling that it was “against Liverpool, I think”, and there is nothing in all the other pages of evidence from various Crewe officials to explain it either. A genuine mystery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5efda62d973b110a3b8f04ddc876edc3832f8586/0_214_3589_2154/master/3589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13f426171949ef3f3a0e2ed6d885683","title":"fulham v chelsea premier league live","story":"A totally unmarked Calum Chambers ghosts in at the back post and draws Fulham level. Chambers peels off his man at the corner, leaving Chelsea to wonder what on earth happened to their marking there. Chambers was in acres and even had the luxury of taking his time to steer home, placing his strike past Kepa.26 min: Kepa keeps out Mitrovic! Ryan Sessegnon raided down the left before pausing his run to tee up the Fulham striker. Mitrovic makes a clean connection on his cross, whacking it goalwards but Kepa tips it over. Fulham corner ...25 min: Willian goes over under the challenge of Cairney but, again, the referee is having none of it. Seconds before, Willian linked nicely with Emerson, who had poured forward down the left flank. He scooped a fine ball into the latter to play across goal, but Fulham snuffed it out. And now the hosts break ...23 min: Chambers blocks off Hazard on the edge of the box after a neat give-and-go with the goalscorer, Higuaín. But Fulham get a little fortunate, with the referee unmoved. Chambers will need to be careful after being cautioned. Hazard’s tail is up, and he is having plenty of joy running at a vulnerable Fulham back line.21 min: And Calum Chambers is so frustrated at falling behind that he’s had a tug at Willian’s shirt. Graham Scott has no choice but to book the Fulham man. That strike means Fulham have conceded a league-high 64 goals this season.Higuaín bags his third Chelsea goal, applying a marvellous first-time finish to Azipilicueta’s low cross from the right. Fulham were caught out by the Chelsea overload, with Willian and Azpilicueta bombing down the flank. The ball in is simple but equally perfect for the Argentine to smash hard beyond Rico.18 min: Kepa makes an almighty error – but Chelsea are off the hook! The Chelsea goalkeeper fails to claim a poor ball into the box by Kevin McDonald – it is right down Kepa’s throat – and makes a real hash of things, with the ball squirming through his hands. The ball ends up bouncing, but Ryan Babel did not anticipate the Spaniard cocking things up and Chelsea survive. Just imagine ...15 min: A short delay as Kevin McDonald needs a change of shirt, with his first one ripped. Graham Scott, the referee, relays that to a baffled Higuaín.14 min: Chelsea calm things down with some simple passing around the back. But then Kanté is slipped in down the right. He immediately looks for Higuaín, who again is a little sluggish to react. The striker is not having it all his own way.12 min: Sessegnon skips away from Jorginho, but his cross is cleared by Andreas Christensen. Fulham are up and at ‘em, and the supporters sound their appreciation.11 min: Chelsea make in-roads down the left and Willian tries to sniff out an angle on the edge of the box to take aim, but Fulham make life difficult. The hosts then break up the other end but Mitrovic cannot nudge the ball into the path of Ryan Babel. That ball over the top has already caused Chelsea a couple of problems.8 min: Scott Parker’s roaring his team on on the touchline. He looks a seasoned pro at this. Maurizio Sarri should be relatively happy with Chelsea’s start too.7 min: And then Higuaín gets a golden chance inside the box after being picked out by Hazard but, ultimately, the Chelsea striker’s first touch lets him down. He’s slow to get a shot off and Havard Nordtveit gets across to steal the ball.6 min: Azpilicueta does brilliant to deny Tom Cairney, after meeting Babel’s low ball on the edge of the box. The Chelsea skipper throws himself at it to get the block in. The ball falls kindly for Bryan, who has a pop from distance. For a moment, it looks as though it could nestle in the top corner of Kepa’s goal, but the Spaniard comfortably claims it in the end. A promising Fulham.4 min: Higuaín drops a header just wide of Rico’s goal! After winning the free-kick, Willian swings the ball in from the right and, while the initial cross is cleared, Fulham struggle to get rid. Kanté ends up driving from distance and when Hazard floats a dangerous cross back in, the Chelsea striker glances wide.3 min: Willian buzzes down the right flank and Joe Bryan chops the Brazilian down. Fulham are on the back foot early on here.2 min: Tim Ream clears a ball in from the right by Azpilicueta. Fulham badly need to keep things tight early on they have the worst defensive record in the league.1 min: Tom Cairney is penalised for an early foul, allowing Chelsea to assume some early possession, and an early touch for Kepa. Jorginho finds Hazard with a neat ball through the midfield, but he cannot get the ball under control after picking out Higuaín.And Mitrovic get us under way at Craven Cottage.The teams are on the pitch! We are just the pre-match formalities away from kick-off. Sarri trudges out first, followed by Scott Parker and Stuart Gray, who returned as assistant manager this week.Anyway, back to the west London derby, where Fulham remember are on this wretched run of form having lost eight of their past nine matches. Chelsea, after a worrying dip and being edged out on penalties by Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, got back on song at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Andre Gray has won it for Watford at Vicarage Road:Maurizio Sarri insists it’s “case closed” when it comes to Kepa Arrizabalaga, but we let Jacob Steinberg have the final say:This is the start of an important few weeks for Chelsea, with Dynamo Kiev on the horizon in the Europa League on Thursday before a date at home to Wolves, who are hot on their heels in seventh. Then Chelsea travel to Cardiff and Everton before March is out. “In England it’s very difficult to be in the top four,” Sarri said on Friday. “Every match is really very difficult, mentally very expensive. So you risk to arrive to this moment of the season really very tired — more mentally than physically. The target of my club is to return to the Champions League.”As expected, Ryan Sessegnon is back in for his first Premier League start since December. Parker has been waxing lyrical about the 18-year-old this week, saying how he will remind the teenager, who grew up in Roehampton, that he is loved by his boyhood club. “He was pivotal to getting this club into this ision,” Parker said. “For someone at such a young age to do what he did last year, and even now for someone at such a young age to be in the top league which is the best in the world is amazing. Like anything, when you’re a young boy, you have moments when you have little dips. But certainly Ryan Sessegnon is someone that we all love, whether that’s the fans, the actual club, the academy, the coaching staff. Certainly we’ll be trying to get the best out of him because he has so much quality and you know for sure that he can help us in the remaining part of the season.”Scott Parker’s programme notes touch on what has been a challenging week for Fulham. “It has been a very hard week given our two recent defeats on the road and subsequent departure of Claudio Ranieri,” he says. “Today, I find myself in the position of caretaker manager. Having previously been club captain of Fulham, it gives me immense pride to take charge. Results on the pitch this season have not been what we expected or wanted. I will do my utmost to bring everyone together and more work had to provide a more positive outlook for as long as I am asked to do.”Team news news: Kepa Arrizabalaga is back in between the sticks for Chelsea, with Willy Caballero returning to the bench as Maurizio Sarri makes five changes from his side’s win over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge in midweek. Scott Parker makes just the one change from the Fulham team beaten by Southampton on Wednesday, with Ryan Sessegnon returning. André-Frank Zambo Anguissa is the player that drops out. Defensively, it’s the same back five that were all over the shop at St Mary’s. Sergio Rico, for one, could do with a big performance.So, Claudio Ranieri will not face his former club but Scott Parker will – as the caretaker Fulham manager. Ranieri was sacked after a miserable run of three wins in 17 games, leaving Fulham 10 points from safety and Parker, the Italian’s first-team coach, to pick up the pieces and smooth the club’s inevitable return to the Championship. Ranieri was ridiculed by travelling supporters in his final game at Southampton in midweek – there were unflattering banners, chants and jeers – and Parker knows his first task is to galvanise a club that has badly lost its way, underlined by a wild, and excessive, £100m-plus summer spending spree. “There’s no denying, and it doesn’t lie, that the owners of this football club have invested an awful lot of money,” Parker said. “At the end of the season, whether you’re winning leagues or getting relegated, it’s a time to reflect and work out where the mistakes have been made and where you can improve things.” Parker’s first starting lineup as manager will be intriguing, with the 38-year-old likely to recall Ryan Sessegnon, the teenager ushered to the fringes by Ranieri, who lasted just 106 days after replacing Slaviša Jokanović. On the theme of Chelsea reunions, the game may come too soon for André Schürrle, who has been bogged down by a virus. And then there’s the small matter of whether Kepa will replace Willy Caballero in goal for Maurizio Sarri’s side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3fef550a7fd6ceb09a225228b7857514fbb5a3/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=962621c5050b2ecf10282eb380b3daf3","title":"watford v leicester city premier league live","story":"A late goal from the substitute, Andre Gray, gave Watford all three points as Brendan Rodgers began life at Leicester with a defeatThat, then is us, but there’s no need to be upset instead, have a shmy over to our next game, in which Scott E. Parker’s Fulham face Kepa Arrizabalaga’s Chelsea.So there we go. Watford stay eighth, but look on course for “their best finish in the Premier League era,” for those unarsed about Graham Taylor’s monumental achievement in 1982-83. Leicester stay 11th.What a win that is for Watford, who were organised, doughty, and found that extra little bit at either end of the game. Leicester were poor - unnecessarily so - though there is plenty for their new manager to work with.90+5 min The initial cross is cleared, then Maddison gets another go and for a second it looks as though Schmeichel is there for it ... but Doucoure intercepts, then Foster kicks away another low cross! 90+4 min Holebas prods Ricardo’s cross behind and up comes Schmeichel...90+3 min Gray is booked for removing his shirt is unbridled ecstasy and right so, We can’t have such malign emotion sullying “this league”. Football’s the winner. Schmeichel picks out Docoure with a poor goalkick, and his header finds Deeney who, senses that Gray is in behind him, hooks a lovely pass from out to in, meeting the run of his mate ... who holds off Morgan to slip home the winner! 90+1 min Watford send on Cleverley for Hughes. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes. 90 min Maddison overhits his corner but beyond the back post, Evans keeps it alive and eventually he gets another go, feinting inside then nipping outside, diddling Janmaat ... and his cross is a goodun! But Morgan can only head down and wide! 89 min Leicester press as Watford sit back, and Maguire steps out with the ball, finding Chilwell, and though his cross is overhit, the pressure forces Hughes to head behind at the back post the corner forces another.88 min Lovely pass from Maddison, inside Will Hughes, that gives Chilwell the chance to craft a cross. But his low effort is directed straight at Foster, and Watford see the danger away.87 min Pereyra needs treatment so we enjoy a little recess. 85 min Gray swings a ball out from the back and immediately, Watford are under pressure. Iheanacho manages to control and move it into stride, and with Maddison galloping all he needs to do is hit the space between defence and keeper. He cannot.84 min Deeney robs Ricardo, who can’t help but chase back to kick him. He’s booked, but the free-kick comes to nowt. 83 min I’m not certain why Rodgers would remove Tielemans, who’s not been in the game enough, but who you might want if you’re hoping to find a winner. 81 min Vardy now sits as Watford play on, until the ball is shmiced out of play. Leicester then make two changes: Mendy for Tielemans and Iheanacho for Vardy,81 min Vardy has picked up some kind of injury - he’ll be off shortly, and is currently down on his haunches. 80 min It’s Leicester stroking it around now, and they need to try and get Tielemans on the ball, especially if Watford’s centre-backs don’t drop. 79 min So, can either side find a winner? They’re both going for it, Chilwell, breaking and curving a pass across the box to Vardy. It takes him wide, so Leicester build again...77 min That’s the first home goal Watford have conceded in 2019.Maguire wins a header and it bounces to Tielemans, who, under no pressure, moves forward then puts Vardy in a race with Mariappa thanks to a nicely-weighted through-pass. Only one winner there, and Vardy screeches onto the ball, then contorts his body to dispatch the equaliser with the outside of his right foot. Lovely pass, lovely finish, but very poor from Watford who administered very little pressure, playing to the obvious strengths of the two who made it happen.75 min Ndidi finds himself out on the right and with Vardy haring into the box, larrups a useless cross ... that hits the to of the bar! 74 min Gray to Tielemans to Ndidi, who swipes a ball out to Chilwell on the left, only to find he’s gone all Ed Crane. 72 min I admit it: I though this game would be a lot better than this. It is not. 70 min Fine run from Maddison, set away by Tielemans, and he has Grey and Vardy ahead of him ... but can’t quite find the angle to slip the former through. So eventually he settles for a simple pass, and Grey dribbles a shot into the nearest shin.69 min Change for Watford: Grey replaces Deulofeu, who’s had moments and helped set the pattern of the game with his movement and nip. 67 min “Brendan gets a lot of stick,” emails Football Thanksalot, a jazzer of a name if ever I’ve heard one, “but who is more deluded, him or the Leicester board who thought getting rid of Puel was a good idea?”If I was a Leicester fan I’d have wanted Puel out for his League Cup behaviour last season - he picked a weakened side v Manchester City, lost on penalties, and missed out on a semi v Bristol City. He did the same this season, missing out on a semi v Burton, and then tossed away the cup at Newport. The Leicester fan I know was pleased to see the back of him, and excited to see what happens next. 66 min Naturally it’s not the system but the players. Rodgers sends on Gray for Barnes, so Maddison moves to the left of the the space behind Vardy. All the difference, I’m sure. 65 min This is really disappointing from Leicester, but Watford are shutting them down very well.64 min Mike Stowell is delivering a soliloquy to Demarai Gray, who will soon be in amongst it. 62 min Maddison’s free-kick is cleared and Watford break, the ball quickly shuttled into the space between Deeney and Schmeichel. Neither are pulling out of this, and it’s the keeper who’s there first, wearing a slide from Deeney who’s booked. I’m not sure that was necessary, he could hardly pull out of it. This is “this league” after all.60 min Morgan is all over Deeney as they contest a high ball but the ref sees nowt untoward, and later in the passage, Capoue trips Maddison and is booked. That’s probably for an accumulation of niggles, but Doucoure is booked for whining about it nonetheless.

I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin. Sail to the Isle of Man with your car, bike or as a foot passenger - there are some great offers available this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dc0f82ad137418de32b07c84552f01bf1e9f6be/0_188_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d2e7bffeeb61d1b83d57888aa85230a","title":"ban on gagging clauses non disclosure agreements work","story":"New proposals to prevent employers using “gagging clauses” to conceal sexual harassment, intimidation and racism complaints are to be unveiled by the government this week.The plans, to be included in a consultation, could lead to new legislation that would prevent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) being used to prevent victims reporting serious complaints to the police.Ministers have decided to act following high-profile cases including that of Sir Philip Green, chairman of Arcadia Group, who is alleged to have used NDAs to prevent several former employees from speaking out about their experiences of bullying and sexual assault.Announcing the move, business minister Kelly Tolhurst said the proposals were part of wider plans to increase fairness in the workplace. “Many businesses use non-disclosure agreements and other confidentiality agreements for legitimate business reasons,” she said. “What is completely unacceptable is the misuse of these agreements to silence victims, and there is evidence that this is becoming more widespread. Our proposals will help to tackle this problem by making it clear in law that victims cannot be prevented from speaking to the police.“Our proposals to change the law around NDAs and confidentiality clauses are just one step of many that we are taking to kickstart cultural change in the workplace. This includes encouraging more women at the top of business and requiring employers to publish gender pay data.”Many organisations, including government departments, use NDAs legitimately to protect confidential information. However ministers say they are being abused by a “very small minority” of employers to intimidate whistleblowers and conceal harassment and discrimination, including sexual assault, physical threats and racism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047015fb6e4a0b22f6735c6862a4e2393d82301/0_252_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df5439fefcfe4b040637f229aaed7a54","title":"intravenous vitamin injection goes mainstream","story":"Madonna does it. Rihanna’s done it. Katy Perry, Rita Ora and Gwyneth Paltrow have been known to dabble and while there are no clinical studies to prove the benefits of intravenous vitamin therapy, the celebrity wellness trend appears to have gone fully mass market.In a gleaming west London clinic, with plump leather recliners and a TV tuned to Netflix, Yassine Bendiabdallah explains the benefits of his IV treatments. Customers, mostly wealthy and mostly women, visit him for courses of injections promising an array of anti-ageing, anti-stress, brain-boosting, energy-restoring properties. His most popular is the NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which costs £500 and can take up to three hours to administer. “It causes an uncomfortable tightening in your head and chest,” he explains, “but that’s normal”.“There is a significant relationship between the growth in vitamin supplements and injections,” said Tim Hart, a nutritionist at Third Space health club. “A lot of my clients spend hundreds on IV therapy because they believe it has an instant effect. But the reality is that a lot of the time it will be flushed out of the body – so they’re mostly paying for quite expensive urine.”She said vitamin drips were a waste of money: “If someone’s nutrient status is inadequate then a starting point should be improving the quality of diet rather than opting for alternative therapies that may be detrimental.”Fads that proliferate with influencers on Instagram tend to filter through to the mainstream, and it’s here where vitamin drip and supplement selfies have taken hold.“Most of the supplement market is bogus,” said Paul Clayton, a nutritional scientist and former adviser on the committee on the safety of medicines. “It’s not a good model when you have businesses selling products they don’t understand and cannot be proven to be effective in clinical trials. It has encouraged the development of a lot of products that have no other value than placebo – not to knock placebo, but I want more than hype and hope.”Clayton, however, works at the high end of the industry and stands by Lyma, pitched as “the world’s first super supplement” it is sold at £199 for a one-month supply. “It’s not the most rational combination of compounds, they could be more focused, but as a performance-related product, it has an effect on making you look and feel good.”But he seems perplexed that the product, which is popular with models and actors, might be considered essential. “If I was trying to make a public health initiative, this isn’t where I’d start,” he says. “I’m OK standing behind it because I know the science is good but it’s for people who have money to spend on looking and feeling good. I’m not who it’s designed for.”What would he recommend to anyone browsing an aisle of vitamins, keen to improve their physical wellbeing? “Stop smoking, take more exercise and eat lots of fruit and veg.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feaddc01f5180a1e05532ad44c4bf311b799e8d3/0_1644_4391_2632/master/4391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a444908003d227efb104d3ee09ee6c54","title":"james wong garden hardy orchid summer bulbs","story":"The right orchids work as well in temperate British gardens as in subtropical forests, so plant bulbs now and enjoy flowers for years to comeIt’s finally March and we’ve already had the first signs of spring. If the arrival of blackbird song and daffodils are wonderful enough on their own, they are also the gardener’s cue to plant summer bulbs for a season of colour ahead. However, beyond the garden-centre mainstays of giant hybrid dahlias and petal-packed begonias, there are amazing finds for adventurous growers, including my ultimate summer bulbs, hardy orchids.Full disclosure: I love hardy orchids because I am unashamedly obsessed with exotic-style gardening. But unlike many other exotic-looking plants, hardy orchids look as at home in rustic cottage-style gardens and temperate woodland glades as they do planted under a subtropical canopy of exotic ferns. Given their striking beauty, amazing garden versatility and ease of culture, it’s a shame they are still so underused. This is my attempt to change that, starting with three of my favourites.First up, the egret orchid of Japan, Habenaria radiata, whose stunning, white, frilly-edged petals resemble a bird in flight. If you give them dappled sunlight, with plenty of rich organic matter to mimic their damp woodland home, peanut-sized tubers planted now could give you blooms for years to come. I have planted mine in a large, shallow earthenware dish which can be placed on a patio table, so these intricate flowers on 30cm spikes can be appreciated up close. Despite their far-flung origin and unusual appearance, the plants are pretty hardy, down to about -5C. This means they should be fine in the ground throughout sheltered spots in southern Britain, and given a good thick layer of mulch in winter, which will double up in breaking down to enrich the soil. However, growing them in pots, like I do, means they can be transferred to a dark, cool, frost-free place once dormant in winter, should tumbling temperatures strike.If you are looking for blizzard-proof hardiness, slipper orchids (cypripediums) are where it’s at. Cypripedium ‘Emil’, a cross between American and European species, has excellent hybrid vigour. Plants are hardy down to at least -20C and are probably the strongest-growing of all members of the genus, with delicately scented, dazzling blooms of curly, rusty red petals and a swollen “slipper” in bright sulphur yellow.Being descended from two woodland species, these plants enjoy moist but not waterlogged conditions, in light shade. Much like egret orchids, these 30cm-high blooms will look great in pots raised up to eye level. Always pick glazed (not porous) containers with adequate drainage holes, so as not to run the risk of them drying out quickly in summer or filling with water in winter, giving plants even moisture conditions.Finally, Calanthe ‘Takane’ is another cross between wild species, which has produced a super-charged offspring. It’s taller than the other orchids here, with flower spikes of around 50cm high. ‘Takane’ combines soft orangey reds with lime green and pale yellow in the same flower, with generous sprays on leafless plants, followed by lush, corrugated leaves like a Chinese fan.And as well as all of these, there are plenty of other amazing hardy orchids, from Bletilla to Pleione, to discover."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44224c451072a433dcf7c6d9549f4cf578c68cd3/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303130233d725196accc0b4a17d383b2","title":"pyjamas the pub and harry potter my perfect cosy sunday","story":"For me, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in PJs. But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: weneedtotalkabout@… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3668cffb7b2e92acd9b9b0ff09685c51552d4902/345_294_7406_4444/master/7406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0dd6d2cd8756b7fef2b10ab13f37a1","title":"dave psychodrama interview black is confusing","story":"Before I meet Dave, rapper, musician, singer, songwriter, award-winner, straight-in-at-Number-Oner, irregular-regular 20-year-old from Streatham, I am allowed to hear his new album. This is a big deal. In fact, it’s such a big deal that Dave’s PR sits in with me when I listen – not to monitor my reaction, but because the album has been kept in such secrecy that he hasn’t heard it yet either. We sit, notebooks out, while a nice woman called Ruby from Dave’s management team plays the 11-track album from her laptop.Dave’s album is also a big deal because, over the past four years, he’s zoomed from an unknown 16-year-old rap sensation to a platinum-selling artist who, so far, has only released singles (11, not counting special appearances on other people’s), plus two EPs, Six Paths and Game Over. His fans have been clamouring for this LP, bombarding him on social media for over a year.Although Dave – full name David Orobosa Omoregie – is usually classed as a rapper, he also makes pop, grime and Afrobeat: hits such as No Words (featuring MoStack) showcase not only his gift for a tune, but his decent singing voice Wanna Know was only out for five weeks before Drake remixed it and added a verse Funky Friday, with Fredo, beat Calvin Harris and Sam Smith to go straight in at No 1 last year.But it’s his less poppy, more serious stuff that I like. His words are lyrical and technical, clever and moving, with a melancholic heart that comes not just from the minor chords he plays on the piano. Several of his songs seem almost suffused with pain. Question Time, which directly addresses Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and David Cameron, moves through NHS funding, Trump and Grenfell, and won him an Ivor Novello. My 19th Birthday is regretful and complicated: “They tell you that home’s where the heart is, but I got a hole where my heart is.”There is sunshine, though, as well as shade, sometimes within the same track: last year’s Hangman (my favourite) is beautiful, economic – “between stopping it and living it I’m sitting in the thick of it” – and has a little jazzy outro that actually makes you laugh when you hear it. (In the video for Hangman, Dave’s friends do just this: filming was the first time they’d heard the track, and when the outro is played they start giggling and dancing around.)Anyway: the album. Entitled Psychodrama, the cover features a blue-tinted painting of Dave with his head in (blue) flames – appropriate imagery for an artist who has so much firing in his brain. Fraser T Smith, veteran of Stormzy and Adele, is a producer other producers include long-standing collaborator 169 (who’s worked with Headie One, Big Zuu, Jme) and Nana Rogues (Tinie Tempah, Drake).After we hear it, Ruby, the PR and I, plus the head of the PR company, all hop in a cab to the Observer office for the interview and photoshoot. This morning, Dave has been at designer Ozwald Boateng’s studio, getting fitted for a suit, and we were told he would be late in fact, he’s already sitting quietly in reception with his friend Justin (Juss), who comes with him everywhere. Dave’s two managers then turn up too. By the time we go into the photo studio, we’re eight-strong. (“More than when we had Kendrick Lamar,” someone says later.) Among this mad throng, Dave himself is low-key, polite, in baseball cap and puffa. He is unfazed by the scruffiness of the photo studio. He has a serious face, a quiet voice. When he smiles, he shows tough metal teeth, but this somehow makes him look even younger. If you give him a compliment, he says “Thank you”, and puts a fist on his heart.Once everyone has stopped bustling about and left the photography studio, we perch on high seats and talk Psychodrama. Making it, says Dave, took a lot out of him. (He works hard on his songs: he has called them “gold or silver, something rare or precious”.) He started it on 23 January 2018 (the date opens the album), and finished it last month. So, one year. A year when his life was pretty busy – Hangman came out at the beginning, Funky Friday in October, plus he appeared on Avelino’s U Can Stand Up and tried some acting – and he felt changed by the end of it. He hopes the progression is clear: “From the start, when I was more reluctant to speak, to the end, which is embracing the idea that it’s OK to find out a bit about yourself.”You could call Psychodrama a concept album: the first track is called Psycho, the last Drama, and throughout there is the (acted) voice of a psychotherapist – or “psychodrama-thist”, as Dave says to me – talking to Dave as though he’s in a session, encouraging him to open up about his problems. The album has a three-act structure: act one he defines as “environment” act two “relationships” act three “social compass”.Act one, then. Dave in his environment, as represented by tracks Psycho (“I ain’t psycho, but my life is”), Streatham (self-explanatory) and Black. Black is the first single from the album, and it’s powerful both angry and celebratory, with some strong lines. “Black is stepping in for your mother because your father’s gone… You don’t know the truth about your race cos they erasing it… Representing countries that never even existed while your grandmother was living.” (Some Radio 1 listeners have complained about Black’s “negativity” DJs Annie Mac and Greg James took them to task.) Dave recorded it towards the end of the album process: he’d meant to make an upbeat tune, but instead he wrote a darker instrumental (he usually works on the music before the lyrics: it sets his mood). The words took him some time, as he did a lot of research, including talking with a Ghanaian friend who’d been tracing his family tree (the friend discovered that he was, in fact, Egyptian).“That track is my experience,” says Dave. “Me being south London, black, Nigerian, that’s what I’m mainly basing it on. It’s a good representation of what I associate with and everything that I think, but I don’t think that it’s universal for the whole black experience, because there’s too many different races and dynamics within the race of black. For a black person who’s Senegalese, growing up in France, or a New York Jamaican, that’s a completely different relationship with being black and how you might be accepted in that culture or that world. Everyone’s experience is different. Especially black women and black men.”Despite his research, even now, he isn’t sure. “Black is confusing. Where does the line start and stop with what is black and what isn’t black?” He feels as though society lumps all black people together, and he wonders how carefully people are looking. “People that are mixed-race, or, imagine being from Sri Lanka or Bangladesh, people might say you’re black but your features are so non-black, like you’ve got straight hair, you’ve got like a sharper nose, or such. No matter what people can see, whether black African, black Jamaican, black British, black American people… they just say it’s one thing.”Back to the album. Act two, the middle section, is catchy and poppy. Act three is interesting, with a couple of tracks that call back to Streatham, but with more insight: “You see a gangster, I see insecurity.” There’s an 11-minute track called Lesley that’s like a movie in song form: “A story about someone suffering a complete loss of character by being with someone that isn’t good for them,” says Dave. And then Voices, the penultimate track, which I assumed was about a relationship – “I fell in love with optimism” – is, it turns out, about Dave himself. “That whole track is metaphorical,” he says, “but it’s about a constant chase for happiness. So when I’m saying, ‘All my life, I hear voices when I sleep, and they say, “You’re everything I need”,’ the everything I need is myself. Inner happiness. What everyone’s looking for.”Drama, the final track, sits slightly separately from the others. It features a recording of a phone call from Chris, the younger of Dave’s two older brothers, who’s in prison serving a life sentence. “The concept of psychodrama actually came from the type of therapy Chris has been having in prison,” says Dave. “The whole idea for the album, everything’s based off him, and that song is a conversation between me and him.” In the track, Dave uses Chris’s words to create lyrics. Chris mentions living on the edge, like a house on a cliff, which Dave runs with and “forget the other brother that was even bigger, we were figures just trying to figure out if we could be a figure” – he says that’s Chris’s too.The lyrics that stuck with me, I say, are “I don’t have a vision of a marriage or a wedding ring, world domination in music or it ain’t anything. Obsessed.” And “I learned all the time the separation issues I described are probably the reason that I struggled feeling anything.”“Well,” he says, “those are the truth.”Though they are close now, when they were growing up, Dave and his brothers weren’t, particularly. Ben was eight years older than Dave, Chris five, so they were always at different stages in their lives: one at college, one at secondary school, one in primary. Their dad wasn’t around to bring them closer – “I didn’t get a chance to have any memories with him” – and their mum often worked day and evenings, as a nurse and cleaner, to support her family.Dave was academic and quite serious as a kid, and when I ask him about childish things – hobbies, posters on the wall – he simply can’t answer me. “I wouldn’t have thought to go and get a poster,” he says. “I just sort of existed. I was in this long trance of just waking up, going to school, coming back. I never really had a crazy outward personality, I only found that when I was 15, 16.”Actually, his mum decided not to let Dave out after school from the age of 11. That was when Chris was sent to prison (he was involved in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden), followed by Ben, for robbery, a few years later. Dave’s mum reacted by keeping her youngest son at home as much as she could. (Chris agreed he would phone Dave to check.) It was hard for the young Dave, and not just because he didn’t go out socially. He would visit his brothers in prison – they were moved all over the place – and absorb his mum’s trauma. “I don’t know how she felt,” he says, now. “Too many different things.” He grew up quickly, though he feels that would have happened anyway, just living in London.“It’s not the same as having a friend in prison,” he says. “Where it’s my brother, the impact that it has on my mum, on the rest of us, the impact it has on anything good… I never want to sound like I’m speaking about prison and I’m crying or moping. But it was definitely a massive knock-on effect for all of us. It’s been a tough journey for everyone involved.”Trapped indoors as he was, young Dave tried a bit of rapping, putting out a track when he was 13. (“Everyone hated it,” he laughs. “So I retired. From 13 to 15, that was my retirement.”) Then, when he was 14, his mum got him a digital keyboard, and he decided to learn how to play. He liked film soundtracks, the tunes from anime, and he fancied trying to make music. So he challenged his friend Kyle to learn piano with him. Each week, they would each choose a piece – Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah, or a song from an anime show – and then track down the sheet music online, learn it, practise it and compete with each other as to who played the best song. Dave was playing piano for four or five hours every night, encouraged by his music teacher at school. (He’s still close to Kyle, and Kyle plays on Psychodrama.)When he was 16, on the first day he went to sixth-form college in Richmond (to study philosophy, ethics, law and sound design), Dave released a freestyle on rap station Bl@ckbox. Within months he was on Jamal Edwards’s influential SBTV a year later, sampled by Drake. His life changed.Last summer, when Ben came out of prison after four years, Dave was able to give him money he’d had nothing when Ben went in. Now, he’s planning to buy a new house, for him and his mum. “I was always going to move with my mum,” he says. “It was always going to happen.” He wants her to give up work, but she won’t. Not until she’s 60 (she’s 55 now).There is a lot going on. Dave’s been trying his hand at acting, which he enjoyed, though he found it hard to adjust to at first. “I hated the lack of flexibility,” he says. “They pick you up 5am, and you got to be there, you got to do makeup, got to do costume. If you’re late, there’s people that you answer to. It’s like being at school again. And other things, like getting used to the fact that you’re actually a very small part of a big moving picture. Or, like, I spent my whole life looking into the lens of a camera. And then to be told you can’t look at the lens.”He’s been getting wound up about football. He supports Manchester United, because his brothers had already taken Chelsea and Arsenal, and got some stick online over United’s recent match against Paris Saint-Germain, as he’d made a track with AJ Tracey about Thiago Silva, a PSG player. “I’m actually connected to football way harder than people think. So I get really rattled, and I have to come off Twitter.”As you might guess from his track Question Time, Dave is interested in politics. He’s funny and engaged on Brexit (he voted Remain, because of the European Court of Human Rights). He has friends who voted Leave – “Kyle did! Wasteman!” – but he understands why. “Everyone pretends,” he says. “You might say, ‘This is what is best for the country,’ but it’s not ever about what’s best for the country. It’s what’s best for you inside of the country.” He sees this in domestic politics, too. “You might say, ‘I’m going to vote for Labour because they going to make the public sector a lot more funded and blah-blah-blah.’ Really, it’s going to make your life easier. But if you’re making tens of millions a year, you know that if someone from Labour gets voted in, you might be getting super taxed, so you support the other group.”When he was younger, and getting into the odd bit of trouble, Dave had a few therapy sessions himself. He understood why, but, as he gets older, he thinks that therapy “isn’t necessarily always in the form of someone sitting down with a notepad. It might be a friend who you call in the night.” He used to beat himself up about stuff, or want to speak about it online, but he’s a little easier on himself now. He’s cutting down on the internet chat, on explaining himself for video platforms. He’s clear in his lyrics, he thinks. I agree: Dave’s words are a thing of beauty. His art explains his life, sometimes in a way he can’t completely understand.“Sometimes I sit down and I think ‘Do I regret this? Do I regret that?’ And I feel like everything makes this snowball effect, you know? If you regret something, it’s good because it just means that it’s something that’s affected you enough for you to stop and think... There’s a reason that everything happens.”He quotes a lyric to me, from another rapper, about the Garden of Eden. He loves this lyric. “Because everything wouldn’t be everything,” says Dave, “if the Garden of Eden went right.”Psychodrama is released on Friday on Neighbourhood.

For that reason, his achievement didn’t really need the special attention of one of the BBC’s Total Immersion days as much as that of some of his contemporaries, but it nevertheless provided an opportunity to wonder again at the ingenuity and sheer beauty of his music.A lunchtime selection of chamber works, performed by students from the Guildhall School, was followed by early-evening choral pieces from the BBC Singers. Later, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its chief conductor, Sakari Oramo, switched the focus to Ligeti’s orchestral works, with a programme including the two great concertos, for violin and for piano, which dominated his output in the late 1980s and early 90s.Despite the stylistic shift that overtook his music in the 1980s and which is celebrated in the concertos, they are just as radical and subversive as anything that preceded them. The Violin Concerto explores new possibilities of pitch and tuning, while the piano work ties itself up in polyrhythmic knots and bewilderingly shifting harmonic layers. Both of the Barbican soloists were excellent, though Augustin Hadelich’s performance of the violin work lacked the elemental ferocity of Patricia Kopatchinskaja’s in the Southbank Centre’s Ligeti weekend last May in the Piano Concerto, Nicolas Hodges remained cool and unfussily precise, while the orchestra took off on its own adventures.Around those works, Oramo offered a potted history of Ligeti’s earlier development. Atmosphères was the piece whose clusters and curtains of sound had announced him as a distinctive new voice in European music in 1961, while Clock and Clouds of 1973 epitomised the glistening, bewitching world of his mature music. Best of all was San Francisco Polyphony from 1974, one of Ligeti’s greatest achievements and the last purely orchestral piece he wrote. It’s both a virtuoso challenge for any orchestra and a virtuoso demonstration of his aural imagination as it morphs from melodies to patterns and back again, steadily building in intensity, like a latter-day equivalent of Ravel’s La Valse. The BBCSO played it superbly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

The EU has suggested progress has been minimal.The European Research Group, a group of Tory Eurosceptics led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has agreed that a group of eight lawyers, seven of them MPs, will scrutinise and pass judgment on the final compromise offered by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox.The group will be chaired by the veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash and includes the DUP’s Nigel Dodds, whose opinion carries huge weight with Tory Brexiters.Others in the group include the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, former Department for Exiting the European Union ministers David Jones and Suella Braverman and the backbenchers Michael Tomlinson and Robert Courts, both former barristers, as well as Martin Howe QC, chair of the pro-leave group Lawyers for Britain.Tomlinson told the Sunday Times that the committee would apply three tests to whatever Cox produced from the negotiations in Brussels, which if met would deliver the support of the group’s key backers, including Rees-Mogg and former Brexit minister Steve Baker.Tomlinson said the change “has got to be legally binding, so effectively treaty-level change” and that the attorney general must secure changes that altered his legal advice that the backstop could “endure indefinitely”.The third requirement is “a clear exit route” such as an end date or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK to leave the backstop. It remains very unlikely that Brussels is willing to offer anything close to that demand.“There is a spectrum and a range of options that the attorney general has, but I’m not going to say protocol good, codicil bad, letter very bad, because that would be prejudging it,” Tomlinson said.May’s hopes of passing her deal were given a boost by Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee and who has previously successfully championed a Commons amendment that instructed May to return to Brussels to negotiate the complete removal of the backstop from the withdrawal agreement and find another way to solve the Irish border issue.Now Brady has indicated he could be prepared to drop his demand on the condition that the attorney general wins assurances that the backstop will be temporary.Brady told the Observer that his intention had always been to “ensure that the backstop could not assume a permanent status, trapping the UK in the EU customs union”.“As long as the attorney general is able to assure the house that he has a legally binding guarantee that the backstop can only be temporary, I would accept that and would urge others to accept it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80497d055542a7eecb621d55213979f7f53582d/0_55_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8df304d4642478dba1d2e654ff92527","title":"women politics democrats emerge america virginia","story":"The 2018 midterm elections saw a record number of women elected to Congress. Now, women are organising to make the ‘moment’ into a movementJust days after the most female freshman class in American history was sworn into the 116th Congress in January, the next wave of aspiring women candidates gathered in the basement of a university building in downtown Richmond, Virginia.Together over the next six months, these women will learn the fundamentals of running for office – how to build a campaign team, deliver a stump speech and raise money.The prospective candidates mostly lack political experience, but they have ambition – a trait that is celebrated at Emerge Virginia, part of the Emerge America national training program for Democratic women started in California in 2002. The non-profit aims to help women overcome the obstacles that have long kept the corridors of power overwhelmingly male.One of the new trainees in the Virginia program is Ivory Dean, a science policy fellow in Washington DC, who plans to start her career in local politics. But, with Washington in turmoil and a nation ided, she fully intends to one day run for president of the United States.“We need leaders now more than ever,” Dean said. “So I asked myself, why am I waiting for someone else to come along and be that leader?”The 2018 midterm elections saw the biggest jump in women elected to the House since the original “Year of the Woman” in 1992. The new Congressional class was the youngest and most erse in history, ushering in a wave of political firsts that include the first two Native American women and the first two Muslim women elected.“In politics there are these jolts to the system and something fundamental happens,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia, who writes extensively about women in politics. “It’s likely that 2018 was that year.”Now the task for groups like Emerge, Emily’s List, She Should Run and VoteRunLead, which have seen record recruitment since Donald Trump’s election, is to make sure 2018 wasn’t just a “a fad, fancy, or a year”, in the words of the trailblazing senator Barbara Mikulski– and that progress towards equal political representation for women not only continues but accelerates.There’s optimism that the gains made in 2018 are a sign of lasting change.“The trail is being blazed on a daily basis by other women candidates,” said Julie Copeland, the executive director of Emerge Virginia. “I just don’t see any signs of that changing.”Sitting around the horseshoe table near Dean was Jenny High, a business consultant from Glen Allen, north-west of Richmond.She is eyeing an opening on the local school board. Laura Sellers, a counterintelligence analyst from Stafford and the only woman in the Emerge Virginia 2019 cohort to hold elected office – had just committed to challenging the Republican incumbent in Virginia’s senate district 28. Over the next several months of training, Copeland will help connect the trainees with party leaders, elected officials and the sprawling network of Emerge alumnae – many of whom are now positioned to help other women climb the ladder.In early 2017, Copeland received a text messagefrom Jennifer Boysko, an old friend and alumna of a previous Emerge Virginia program who was, at the time, a member of the Virginia house of delegates. Boysko told Copeland she had overheard in the chamber cloakroom that the incumbent from Virginia’s 56th district would not seek re-election in that year’s state races.Copeland immediately thought of two women in the current training program: Melissa Dart and Abigail Spanberger. Neither had ever run for office before but she believed they were ready. She learned that Spanberger was already considering a run for Congress, so Copeland encouraged Dart and she decided to give it a go.“This is what men have done since … forever,” Copeland said. “Now we finally have women on the inside who are helping to build that pipeline.”In June 2017, Dart won her primary. Though she ultimately lost to the Republican in the staunchly conservative district,Dart and many of her staffers put their efforts into Spanberger’s congressional campaign.In November 2018, Spanberger, a former spy, ousted conservative Republican David Brat in a coup for Democrats. Boysko, who started the chain, won a special election to take the state Senate seat left by Jennifer Wexton, who flipped the took her place on Capitol Hill as a rookie member alongside Spanberger and the rest of the record-setting female class.As for Dart, she will be on the ballot again this year, running for a seat on the Henrico county school board.“We learned in candidate training that if you’re not at the table you’re on the menu,” she said, explaining her decision to run again. “We are so done with the sidelines. It’s like un-ringing a bell. You can’t.”After the original Year of the Woman saw a wave of glass-ceiling-smashing and barrier-breaking women were elected to Congress in 1992, progress toward gender parity essentially plateaued.Not this time, says Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List, the fundraising powerhouse that has helped to elect pro-choice women since 1985.“The history we made in 2018 wasn’t the end of our work, and it wasn’t the beginning – it was a culmination of decades of hard work by our organization and our movement, and a sign of much more to come in the years ahead,” she said. Debra Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, thinks the female-led activism and momentum generated by big gains for women in the Trump era are signs that 2018 was not an outlier – but neither was it “mission accomplished”.“The reality is that yes, this was a very good year for women,” Walsh said. “We had a record number of women running, but we need to see more, because we know that when women run they win at the same rate as men do.”In 2020, more women are running for president than ever before. But after the defeat of Hillary Clinton, the first ever female nominee of a major party, some Democrats are wary of a woman leading the party’s ticket.Spanberger, the newly elected Virginia congresswoman, is baffled by this analysis. Before 2018, the voters of Virginia’s 7th district had never elected a woman – or a Democrat – to the seat.“There was a lot of nail-biting about what sort of candidates can win in competitive districts,” Spanberger told the . “One of the lessons we learned in 2018 is that no matter what has historically been the case we cannot judge what voters want because we’ve now been proven wrong multiple times.”As the afternoon waned on the first day of Emerge Virginia’s candidate training, communication coach Courtney Knapp asked for a show of hands of those who had ever been told they were “too” emotional, “too” abrasive, or “too” ambitious. One by one, hands went up.“Welcome to the too club,” Knapp said. “Now take away the too and all of these are great attributes.”The exercise sparked an animated conversation about how to run authentically in the face of stereotypes, double standards and gender bias.Listening to her classmates,High, of Glen Allen, smiled and clasped her hands together.“The class of 2019 is going to have the most women come out as elected officials,” she said, her voice booming over the buzz. There was a pause and then a burst of applause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13aab6468b67a558bbef4858f6c65931ed700c59/14_122_2593_1556/master/2593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d67e4222cd14c6b989061404796a575","title":"spacex crew dragon docks at international space station","story":"Capsule is first US-made, designed-for-crew spacecraft to dock in eight yearsSpaceX‘s new crew capsule has arrived at the International Space Station, completing its second milestone in just over a day.No one was onboard the Dragon capsule that launched on Saturday on its first test flight, only an dummy.The three station astronauts had front-row seats as the vessel docked and became the first US-made, designed-for-crew spacecraft to arrive at the ISS in eight years.TV cameras on Dragon and the space station provided stunning views of one another throughout the rendezvous.If the six-day demonstration goes well, SpaceX could launch two astronauts this summer under Nasa’s commercial crew programme.Both astronauts, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, were at SpaceX Mission Control in southern California to observe the docking. They rushed there from Florida after watching the Dragon rocket go into orbit early on Saturday from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre.“Just super-excited to see it,” Behnken said. “Just one more milestone that gets us ready for our flight coming up here.”SpaceX has sent plenty of cargo Dragons to the space station, but Crew Dragon is a different beast.It docked autonomously instead of relying on the station’s robot arm for berthing, which is how Behnken said it should work when he and Hurley are onboard. They may push a few buttons and will have the ability to intervene if necessary, he said.As part of Sunday’s operation, the sISS astronauts sent commands fto Dragon to retreat and move forward again before the capsule made its final approach.SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, cheered as Crew Dragon docked nearly 260 miles above the Pacific, north of New Zealand. They burst into applause again, several minutes later, when the capsule’s latches were tightly secured.The ISS astronauts offered congratulations to SpaceX as they got ready to open the hatches and collect the supplies onboard Dragon.The capsule’s lone passenger , a mannequin wearing a white SpaceX spacesuit, was also welcomed onboard. The dummy – or Smarty as SpaceX likes to call it, given all the instrumentation – is named Ripley after the lead character in the Alien films.Dragon will remain at the space station until Friday, when it undocks and aims for a splashdown in the Atlantic, a few hundred miles off the Florida coast.Like Ripley, the capsule is rigged with sensors to measure noise, vibration and stresses, and to monitor the life-support, propulsion and other critical systems throughout the flight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94078443f409cdefe176b7e804fc64d0eaab52ef/0_17_5209_3125/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=651e2ac556c5518767ccb33d623bb78d","title":"raise legal smoking age to 21 say mps","story":"Smokers will be banned from buying cigarettes until they are 21 as part of measures to improve public health being considered by the government.An influential cross-party group of MPs has proposed raising the minimum smoking age and introducing a levy on big tobacco companies to fund measures to encourage people to quit and to prevent youngsters taking up the habit.The parliamentary group on smoking and health, backed by 17 health charities and medical organisations, also wants to tighten the rules on showing smoking on TV and in films.“Smoking remains the leading cause of premature death and health inequalities,” said Tory MP Bob Blackman, chair of the group. “Ratcheting up tobacco regulation further and faster is essential to achieve the government’s vision for prevention, to increase healthy life expectancy while reducing inequalities between the richest and poorest in society.”The group, which was instrumental in introducing plain packaging and banning smoking in public places, believes it is pushing at an open door.Hancock has said the government is prepared to introduce new legislation to curb smoking rates. “Smoking remains one of the biggest causes of years of life lost in Britain and other countries,” said David Halpern, who heads the government’s behavioural insight team or “nudge” unit. “The good news is that we have learned a great deal about how to help smokers quit. Pushing forward on this agenda is one of our single best bets to extend life expectancy in the UK, particularly among disadvantaged communities.”The group’s submission to the government’s green paper is backed by Action on Smoking and Health, and 16 other health and welfare organisations, including the British Medical Association, Cancer Research UK, the Royal College of Physicians and the British Heart Foundation. It also calls for the collection and publication of tobacco manufacturers’ sales and marketing data, to monitor the evolving behaviour of the industry, and inserts for cigarette packs with messages encouraging people to quit. There would also be increased funding for education campaigns on social and mass media.Baroness Finlay, a vice-chair of the group, said action was needed because “smoking rates among young people have now started to flatline and the inequalities gap is widening”.Raising the age limit at which people can buy cigarettes to 21 would put the UK on a par with only a few countries and cities in the world, including Honduras, Kuwait and New York City. But it is the introduction of a levy, now said to be under serious consideration by ministers, that could prove the most alarming to the tobacco industry.Under the new proposal, each tobacco manufacturer would effectively have to pay an annual fee based on the volume of smoked cigarettes it sold in the UK, potentially raising hundreds of millions of pounds. But the tobacco industry has fought hard to resist successive governments from introducing legislation that would reduce its profits.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: “Legislation to strictly regulate smoking used to be considered controversial and extreme by all mainstream political parties but governments now have confidence that tough tobacco regulation both delivers results, and, crucially, has widespread cross-party and public support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b41e76eac15b7852ae30ebcb87233b861cd570e9/251_183_2810_1856/master/2810.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=29cdc07fcf23d8212a931d321fa73377 1760w","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

We pick 10 with beautiful views from a new guide, Wild Ruins BCOn the slopes around the modern-day cairn on Dunkery Beacon are the remains of at least five bronze age cairns, from 2000-1600BC. They were burial sites topped with stone but, after a few thousand years, not all are in good shape. The largest and most visible is on the north side, a large mound, 22 metres across. It may have been the closest place to the gods, so a fitting place to enter the afterlife. Some visitors climb from Dunkery Bridge car park, just over half a mile away others prefer the three-mile route from the east, along Macmillan Way from Wootton Courtenay. It’s the highest point in Somerset, and the views are wonderful.Near Dorchester, this is one of the most iconic hillforts in England: at 47 acres – the size of more than 50 football pitches – it is also our largest, and may even be the biggest in Europe. It was originally the site of a causewayed enclosure, a ritualistic tribal meeting ground in the neolithic period (4000 to 2500BC). The site was put to use again in around 600BC as a small hillfort, which was later expanded to the vast site we see today. People lived and worked here, making textiles and working metal. Their roundhouses were built in rows, much like our modern streets. It is a beautiful site to visit, with stunning views across the Dorset countryside. Although the largest, it is not the only hillfort in Dorset: there is the tree-covered Weatherby Castle to the north-east, the tumbling remains of Flower’s Barrow on the coast and Woolsbarrow hidden away in Wareham ForestThe 17th-century diarist John Evelyn said the view from this hillfort atop Herefordshire Beacon was “one of the godliest vistas in England” and it is still regularly cited as one of Britain’s best views. It certainly is stunning, and it is not hard to see why iron-age Britons chose to build here, in the second century BC. The tiers of ramparts, built up throughout the latter iron age, stretch for more than half a mile and enclose an area of 13 hectares (32 acres). At the height of its occupation, there could have been as many as 120 hut circles on the site, housing a substantial population. The nearest parking is opposite the Malvern Hills Hotel. An easy walk to the south is a second hillfort owned by the National Trust, known as Midsummer Hill.Nearly a third of the neolithic stone axes found in Britain are made of Langdale hornstone, or greenstone, found near the summits of Pike of Stickle (pictured) and Harrison Stickle, two of the Langdale Pikes – a difficult place to get to. Broadcaster Neil Oliver says the site of the Langdale axe factory, in the Lake District, might have been as important as the axes themselves. Such was the industry on this site that rejected axes can still be found to this day on the scree slope east of the summit of Pike of Stickle. For those willing and able to brave this treacherous place, a manmade cave can be found around 50-100 metres down the scree slope. It is possible this was a Neolithic construction, built for the axe carvers to retreat into when the weather turned on the mountainside. It’s best reached from New Dungeon Ghyll car park.On top of Arbory Hill are the well-preserved concentric banks of a multi-rampart fort, with extensive views over Clydesdale. Today, the railway line and the M74 take advantage of this opening in the hills, but it would have also been an important route for the Romans, with the remains of their road visible as a scar in the landscape. It is even probable that they in turn built over an existing iron age trackway or trade route. The fort may have supported a small population, as remains of a timber-framed house and a rectangular stone foundation have been found in the inner circle. For a bird’s-eye view of the fort, continue up neighbouring Tewsgill Hill. It’s a 45-minute walk from a layby on Station Road, Abington.This hill fort (not to be confused with the vitrified fort of the same name in Forgandenny) is a stone’s throw from Edinburgh, on the north-eastern end of the Pentland Hills at Easter Howgate, looking down to the Glencorse reservoir. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the fort would have had a large wooden gateway guarding the entrance, of the kind later built for timber colonial forts in the American wild west. Later in the fort’s history, two more earth ramparts were built, and it is thought that the earth house was constructed after the Roman occupation. The Votadini, who constructed this fort, also commanded the one on the extinct volcano of Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh. Park at Castle Knowle car park, near Glencorse.A stone crown sits atop a remote Welsh hill in an area with very few signs of habitation. Far below, a steam train chugs through the valley, but here there is only the sound of the wind through the stones. A local guide poetically translates the name as “fortress of waves on the hill”, but it could also mean “hill of the throne with the flag”. Neither Victorian treasure hunters nor 1930s army target practice even dented the majesty of this isolated bronze age cairn. The stones would have once stood upright, but they have slipped outwards, giving it its current crown shape. Today it is little more than a mass of stones, but the 1920s Inventory of the Ancient Monuments of Wales describes the remains of a burial chamber eight feet by five, with a two-foot stone resembling the gables of the house.

The anecdotes, those advising Sanders hope, will allow him to connect with voters and help distinguish him in a erse Democratic field.“This is the origin story of a political revolutionary,” Shaun King, a writer and activist, said as he introduced Sanders at a kick-off event in Brooklyn on Saturday.Sanders is attempting to build a new kind of campaign, one that seeks to address the weaknesses of his 2016 run by expanding his appeal to nonwhite voters.In Brooklyn, Sanders said: “One of the proudest days of my life was attending the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.”Last time out, the Vermont independent struggled to win over African Americans and other minority voters. He has worked to build more connections with the black community. He joined a unionization effort led by nonwhite workers in Mississippi and backed activists pushing for criminal justice reform in Los Angeles. On Sunday, before speaking in Chicago, he will join his former opponent Hillary Clinton at the annual Martin and Coretta King unity breakfast in Selma, Alabama.“History defines him,” Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who is a co-chair of Sanders’ campaign, said in Brooklyn. “But it’s not just about what he did in the 60s and the 80s and the 90s, it is about what he is doing right now.”Elements that powered Sanders insurgent campaign in 2016 have given the 77-year-old Democratic socialist clear advantages in the crowded 2020 primary: small donors and big rallies. He has raised millions of dollars from a loyal base of supporters contributing as little as $3 his kick-off rally at Brooklyn College drew roughly 13,000 people.Yet this race will be very different from the anti-establishment, insurgent campaign he ran in 2016. The once-unknown Vermont senator has near-universal name recognition and polling shows him near the front, and in some states leading, the field of declared and potential challengers.Acknowledging recently that his 2016 campaign was “too white” and “too male”, Sanders has sought to build an operation that reflects the strong desire within the party to elevate women and minorities. His 2020 effort will be led by Faiz Shakir, the first Muslim campaign manager of a major US presidential candidate. Co-chairs include three people of color: Turner, California congressman Ro Khanna and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.He has also sought to address criticism of his campaign’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations in 2016 by instituting mandatory training and strict reporting guidelines.The race for the party’s nomination has already attracted more than a dozen candidates and several more big names are weighing bids, including former Vice-President Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg. The field is dominated by women and minorities, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, who have weaved their biographies into campaign narratives.In Brooklyn, Sanders injected his now-familiar policy speech with details of his childhood. For a candidate who has resisted speaking about himself, it represented a rhetorical shift.Citing his “experience as a child, living in a family that struggled economically” as something that “powerfully influenced my life and my values”, he roared: “I know where I came from.”His strong accent emphasizing the point, he said: “And that is something I will never forget.”He also sought to draw a sharp contrast between his modest upbringing and the billionaire president from Queens. He told the crowd: “I didn’t have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos and country clubs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2914527a16691c168ed237461aa11b2b371f478b/0_27_894_536/master/894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f58cb644d475f4eb4fa8504a134d5ba","title":"civil rights legend george lakey this is a bigger opportunity than the 60s","story":"It’s heavy out there. Neo-nazism is on the rise. The gap between rich and poor grows ever larger. Protections for women, people of colour, LGBTQ people and immigrants are under attack. Meanwhile, the planet is simultaneously freezing and burning. Yet George Lakey couldn’t be more optimistic.The civil rights legend bounces around his kitchen in suburban Philadelphia as the icy winds whistle outside. “It’s a huge opportunity. Huge,” he grins, waving his long arms inside his cosy cardigan. “I am grateful that, at age 81, I am around and vigorous enough to be able to participate in the political process because this is, in my judgment, the biggest opportunity for major change, in my country, in my lifetime. A bigger opportunity than the 60s and 70s.”Lakey should know. An activist from the age of 12, the sociologist and writer has been manning the barricades for close to 70 years. For an unfailingly polite Quaker, he has quite a rap sheet. He was first arrested in 1963 while protesting in the US’s segregated south, and was most recently arrested in 2018 at a rally demanding more green energy. There have been “a lot” of arrests in between. He helped sail a ship to Vietnam filled with supplies for peace activists during the Vietnam war, led peacekeeping workshops in South Africa with the African National Congress during apartheid, acted as an unarmed bodyguard for human rights defenders in Sri Lanka and has campaigned for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights.To help a new generation of activists, Lakey has just published How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning. It’s a step-by-step guide to the methods and campaigns that have led to progressive change, and an update to A Manual for Direct Action, a handbook for activists he published in 1965. Activist friends had told him they need a guide to help the teens in Florida demanding gun control, Black Lives Matter protesters, trans rights activists and the rainbow coalition of insurgencies that have sprung up in reaction to Donald Trump and the rise of the new right.He said he didn’t want to do it, then completed it in five months. Now he is off on a 20-state tour to promote it, as he did for his 2016 book, Viking Economics, which put forward the Nordic countries as a model for a better world.Not since the 1960s has there been a better chance for real progressive change, says Lakey, and there are some strong parallels. “The 60s and 70s were also highly polarised,” he says. “It saw a rebirth of the American Nazi party the Ku Klux Klan was riding high. National Rifle Association memberships statistics rose enormously. It was a very big time for the right and for the extreme left.“Polarisation, instead of making a society stuck, seems to heat up society and makes it more volatile. And so that means a lot of ugliness comes to the surface, a lot of violence, a lot of nastiness. And at the same time, the sheer volatility enables us to make major changes that otherwise cannot be made.”Lakey hopes that it will be possible to roll back a decades-long power grab by the economic elites that began under Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and other rightwing politicians.The crushing of the unions and the rise and rise of big money put progressives on the defensive, he says. That was a big mistake: instead of pushing for more, they hunkered down to protect what they had. And they lost. “It’s counter to folk wisdom, which says the best defence is offence. It’s counter to what any general would tell you. It’s counter to what Gandhi would say. He was constantly talking to his people about why they must stay on the offensive.”Part of the problem, Lakey believes, is that in the US in particular many of these issues, from women’s rights to labour and the environment, were being taken up by the Democratic party, which is “clueless strategically” and whose big-picture thinking has also come to be dominated by the economic elite.One notable cause that wasn’t picked up by mainstream politics until recently was LGBTQ rights. Even Barack Obama was against same-sex marriage before 2012. “The Democrats didn’t want to touch us with a 10ft pole,” Lakey says. Politicians betrayed their friends and their own convictions “because it was toxic politically to associate themselves with the gay cause”.But LGBTQ people, Lacey believes, benefited from their independence, which allowed them to campaign outside the system. That campaign, outlined in detail in his book, and the fight against nuclear power offer two examples of how progressives can win. Realisable goals, nonviolent protests, targeted campaigns, remaining true to your values – history has lessons to teach us, he says. His biggest fear is that we may not want to listen. “We have a profound dislike of learning from our own history,” he says.There is plenty to learn from Lakey’s personal history. Born in 1937 into a slate mining family in Bangor, Pennsylvania, he was briefly marked out as a potential child preacher. That was a big deal, “equivalent to being a piano prodigy or something”, he says. And his working-class community were excited about the celebrity his calling might bring to their church.At the age of 12 he was asked to give his first sermon. He prayed and prayed for a subject. “The message I got was to preach about it being God’s will that there be racial equality,” he says, smiling broadly. “In total innocence, I preached that, hoping that people would be delighted and proud of me, and say: ‘Oh, this boy has the makings of a preacher.’” The all-white congregation disagreed. His words were greeted with silent disapproval. It was the end of his preaching career.At university, he decided it was time to find a new church and joined the Quakers. But the pacifism proved problematic. “My family was very pro-military,” he says. “I didn’t want to be a pacifist. Especially after I realised my gayness. One thing was enough.” A year later, having read everything that he could find about pacifism, for and against, Lakey was a pacifist, too.“I just was so driven by not only a heart that said killing another person is just plain, fundamentally wrong, but also the pragmatic arguments that came about from the extraordinary successes that I found in history when people boldly tried nonviolence and it worked,” he says.And then there was Lakey’s sexuality. At university he had met, fallen in love with and married a Norwegian foreign student. “I already knew that I was strongly attracted to men, but I was strongly attracted to her. And so I married her telling her that, telling her about my attraction to men. I was in the closet. Nearly everyone was in those days.”By the early 1970s, the couple decided their situation was untenable. “We were being put on a pedestal and I wouldn’t have been there if they knew I was gay. We had adopted cross-racially, these cute black children. And we were living in this rough neighbourhood. So here were these wonderful, urban-pioneer idealist Quakers, you know, with the biracial family and the international family. And we were cute!”The Lakeys decided he had to come out. The reaction was everything they expected. The pedestal was removed and Lakey’s guest-speaker spots dried up.Things have changed “hugely” thanks to activists, he says. But this is no time for complacency. Society may seem more accepting, but “I don’t trust it”, he adds.Which is why he believes now is the time for action. “We’re dealing with thousands of years of oppression. How fast do societies really change their ways?” he says. “Germany looked amazingly progressive in the 20s, in the Weimar period, right? With a very strong gay liberation movement and a lot of intellectual work being done. Berlin was celebrated by Christopher Isherwood. And then, of course, the gay people were sent to concentration camps.And, again, Lakey is full of hope that change is possible. “That doesn’t mean that I’m not enormously sad about the ugliness that goes with it. I cry over the morning newspaper in the kitchen. It’s highly distressing to me that we have to be so hard on each other, that we project our pain upon others … And yet to overlook the opportunity is to just experience the pain. And that would be a tremendous defeat on our part.”George Lakey’s How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning is published by Melville House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760493bfd997ab31ffd1e5f53c1ddcf6aae04a8/0_140_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc321420bf7261dc15b9da0b0d2cef7a","title":"tell us how are you marking international womens day 2019","story":"We’ll be telling stories you contribute on 8 March – wherever you are in the world get in touch belowOn Friday 8 March millions of people will be taking part in events to mark International Women’s Day.

Her days typically begin at 5am, don’t end until 11pm, and are filled with shuttling her nine-year-old son to school, helping him with his homework, preparing meals and running an online clothing business.“It’s hard to find time even to sleep for a few minutes in a chair,” she says, sitting in a McDonald’s while her son plays a game on a phone, the detritus of a Happy Meal in front of him.Most tiring is the constant worry over whether she is doing enough to help him get ahead. He goes to music lessons, taekwondo classes and extra English tutoring. She spends the first week of every summer and winter break helping him prepare for the next term. Sometimes her son’s workload is so heavy that Xu does his assignments for him, using her left hand to make her writing more childlike.“There are too many children and the competition is too high. If you don’t do well in school you can’t get into a good university, and then maybe you can’t get a good job in the future,” she says. She is visibly anxious when discussing the prospect of a second child, something that until three years ago would have been forbidden under Chinese law. “If we were to have another child, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have the energy for them,” Xu says.Faced with a population that is shrinking and ageing, Chinese policymakers are attempting to engineer a baby boom after more than three decades of a Malthusian family planning regime better-known as the one-child policy. Central policy planners have loosened restrictions on family sizes, and now all married couples can have two children. There is talk of the limits being dropped altogether, and amid aggressive propaganda drives, local officials are experimenting with subsidies and incentives for parents.But these efforts appear to be too little too late. Birthrates have fallen and are likely to continue to drop as parents like Xu decide against having more children. More young women are pushing back against state propaganda and family pressure, while improving education standards and income levels have delayed marriage and childbirth. Moreover, decades of the one-child policy have made single-child households the norm, experts say.“China should have stopped the policy 28 years ago. Now it’s too late,” says Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and a longtime critic of the family planning policies.Demographers warn that China’s population will begin to shrink in the next decade, potentially derailing the world’s second-largest economy, with a far-reaching global impact. China’s birthrate last year was at its lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, with 15.23 million births, dramatically lower than the 21-23 million officials had expected.By 2050 as much as a third of the country’s population will be made up of people over the age of 60, putting severe strain on state services and the children who bear the brunt of caring for elderly relatives.Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in China’s rust belt, the north-eastern region better-known as Dongbei which has the lowest birthrates in the country, the result of strict enforcement of family planning limits and the region’s early development. For residents in Shenyang, the largest city in Dongbei, in central Liaoning province, it’s obvious why few families are willing to have more children – the economy.Rich in resources such as iron ore and coal, Dongbei was at the heart of the country’s heavy industry between the 1950s and 1970s. During the reform era, industries moved southward to the coastal regions, and the state-run companies that employed most Dongbei workers have struggled, causing a mass exodus to other parts of China.“Shanghai, Guangzhou, all these cities are moving forward, but Shenyang has stayed in place. All the high-rises don’t change anything,” says Zhang Yang, 36, who works in purchasing for a local state-owned company. “Few people are having babies because the economy is so bad.”During Dongbei’s heyday, Shenyang was the region’s economic hub, with blocks of factories lining its main street. Now those buildings have been replaced by high-rise apartments, banks and hotels while the factories have been relocated to a suburb outside the city. The new economic zone, the new home for these factories, is quiet.Workers in grey jumpsuits walk along the road just before noon. A sign on a taxi calls on Shenyang residents “to fight” for the rejuvenation of their city. Neighbourhoods in the old industrial sector are being torn down to make way for new buildings.The birthrate here is especially low, at 8.79 per 1,000 women, compared with the national average of 12.43 in 2017. The city is ageing quickly – a quarter of residents were above the age of 60 in 2017, and local population experts believe the city will soon overtake Shanghai to have China’s oldest populace.Dongbei’s struggling economy is the main reason Zhang and his wife have decided not to have another child. He has not had a wage increase in three years. When his son goes to kindergarten in a few years, he expects about half of his income will go toward his schooling and extra classes and activities.His hope is that his son will go to university in the south of China and pursue a career and life there. “It’s not that I’m worried about Liaoning’s future. I have no hope for it at all,” Zhang says.Birthrates in Dongbei, home to about 109 million people, have fallen steeply. The average number of children per woman was 0.9 in 2000 and 0.56 in 2015, according to Yi. That means the next generation will be a quarter of the size of the last one.Last summer, Liaoning released a Population Development Plan, vowing to raise the province’s birthrate by “working hard to create good public opinion about having two children”. Officials promised to explore subsidies for families with two children, encourage employers to offer more services for families, and support women returning to work after giving birth.While parents in Shenyang say they have noticed an increase in nursing facilities at shopping centres and other public spaces, they have yet to see any substantial support from the government. “For all these years, there haven’t been any policies to help. Government pledges like these are like thunder without raindrops. This is like lying to a little child,” Zhang says.Dongbei offers an example of what is to come for the rest of the country. As an early industrial hub, the province urbanised quickly, with incomes and education levels several years ahead of the national average – factors that act as natural constraints on the birthrate, according to experts. As other parts of the country go through similar stages of urbanisation and economic growth, they are going through comparable declines.“This is not just Dongbei but the whole country. You know what they say in economics: development is the best birth control,” says Song Limin of the Population Research Institute at Liaoning University.Researchers believe the national rate of births could fall further. Last year’s low rate surprised many. Liang Jianzhang, a professor of economics at Peking University, says he and his colleagues had expected births to peak in 2017 and begin falling after 2018.“That peak apparently arrived in 2016, with births dropping ever since … What we can expect now is that the number of newborns will continue to shrink rapidly in 2019 and beyond,” he wrote in an editorial in January.“It can be said with certainty that even though 2018 saw a low number of births, that number will not be surpassed for the next 100 years. China will never see more than 15 million newborns in the future,” he predicted.Local governments across China are struggling to reverse the declines with subsidies, propaganda initiatives and new regulations on wokplace leave. In Xiantao, Hubei province, hospitals have offered to cover the costs of childbirth as well as give a 500 yuan (£60) subsidy for the first child and another 700 for the second. In Changsha, in southern China, an advertising campaign last year listed “1,001 reasons to have a baby”. Between 2016 and 2017, almost all provinces extended maternity leave.Some worry that such measures will turn coercive, with the authorities deploying an extensive family planning apparatus to encourage births. Officials once restricted population size through heavy fines, forced abortions and sterilisations.“There is a danger that the government sees that what it has tried so far has failed, and it has to become more coercive. There’s a long history in population planning of extreme coercion. There is no question that the government could adopt coercive measures,” says Leta Hong Fincher, author of Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China.Critics say that less invasive but still punitive measures would probably emerge gradually at local level under the guise of other causes such as preventing sex-selective abortions. Several provinces have banned abortions after 14 weeks, and Jiangxi province in the south requires the signature of three medical professionals before the procedure can be performed. More provinces have put in place obstacles to getting orces, including a test or mandated cooling-off period.Government language has alarmed people. Last year an article in the state-run People’s Daily said: “The birth of a baby is not only a matter of the family itself but also a state affair.” In August, an economics professor from Nanjing University wrote an editorial proposing a “birth fund” that citizens contribute to, then cash in when they have children. Those who don’t have children would get the money when they retire.One internet user wrote: “When you don’t want children, you force people to get sterilised. When you want more, you urge us to give birth. What do you think I am?”For now efforts have focused on cajoling women into have more children for the good of the country. The All China Women’s Federation, a government-affiliated organisation, has been running a “beautiful families” campaign, praising women who serve as primary caretakers of their parents and children.“The party state sees the declining population as a real problem, and it’s women’s duty to respond to that,” says Jane Golley, an associate professor at Australian National University, who focuses on the Chinese economy and labour economics. “It’s a new era of control over women’s reproductive choices.”Yet more women are resisting government and societal pressure, and officials are waking up to their concerns. China’s education and human resources ministries have ordered employers to stop asking female applicants about their marital status and plans for children, a common practice.Ye Liu, a sociologist and lecturer in international development at King’s College London, has been interviewing Chinese women in their late 30s. When the two-child policy was introduced in 2016, most of her respondents were in what should have been the “second spring” of their careers, with the raising of their first child already behind them, with seniority and more bargaining power at work. Many were devastated rather than overjoyed by the new policy.Public resentment is one reason why policymakers did not stop the policy sooner. According to Yi Fuxian, the Wisconsin academic, China could have completely scrapped population controls in 1980 and growth would have moderated naturally. But family planners relied on overinflated school enrolment and overreported births by hospitals, iniduals and local governments. “Why did we follow such a wrong policy for so long? The Chinese government doesn’t want to admit it’s wrong. It says the policy was right but now is the time to change. If it just says the policy was wrong, the public will become angry,” he says.Living in a city with some of the lowest birthrates, Shenyang residents appear surprisingly focused on children. Groups of parents and grandparents tote small children around shopping centres filled with playgrounds and stores advertising toys and educational games. Parents describe the range of activities they can choose from: sensory classes for babies, baby swimming classes, taekwondo, Chinese calligraphy, English tutoring or drawing.The Dunnan True Love Centre in central Shenyang offers high-end convalescence for mothers recuperating after childbirth, a Chinese tradition known as “sitting the month”.This is part of a focus on “quality over quantity”, where families invest all their resources into one child, says Wang Libo, an expert on population at Shenyang Normal University. Of the 500 clients the centre received last year, only three have had a second child, as far as they know. But they expect business to be brisk this year: the year of the pig in the Chinese calendar is associated with luck and wealth and thus an auspicious year to be born.For many families, the pressure to help their child compete is the main reason for having just the one. Xu sends her son to extra tutoring and lessons but worries that he is under too much pressure. She has read articles about children, pushed too hard by their parents, who have killed themselves or run away from home. She tries to find a place in his schedule for some free time, and buys him all the comics and books that he wants. Still, when he performs a little worse on a test or assignment, she grows anxious again. “You can’t help but wonder: what if I pushed him to study for just 10 more minutes?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23c881f600deb2466a0602c2f15428cf98f79fe1/0_70_2977_1787/master/2977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1cb549f8a0e8b5d7ef52c8c950b12e0","title":"sudan bashir shuffling power may be first steps change","story":"Bashir has declared state of emergency and promoted ally to head off internal party revoltStreet protesters in Sudan pressing for a change of leader and regime achieved a remarkable turnaround last week – but not the sort they were hoping for.President Omar al-Bashir, who seized power in a coup 30 years ago and has clung on tenaciously since, unexpectedly stood down as head of the ruling National Congress party (NCP). But rather than open the door to reform, as protesters demanded, Bashir gave power to a close ally – who, like him, has been charged by the international criminal court (ICC) with war crimes in Darfur.Ahmad Harun, former governor of North Kordofan state, would serve as acting party leader, an NCP statement said. Harun was appointed deputy leader last week, after Bashir declared a state of emergency.The move by Bashir – who remains president – may have been tactical, analysts say, designed to defuse tensions within the ruling party between its Islamist wing and senior military figures representing the security establishment.Perhaps he had no choice. The state of emergency declaration, Bashir’s simultaneous dismissal of his government, and his replacement of all 18 state governors with loyalists, could have been necessitated by a threatened internal party putsch, the International Crisis Group (ICG) thinktank suggested.It is also possible Bashir’s decision to step back marks the beginning of the end for one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders. Like Algeria’s 81-year-old president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika – also the target of big weekend demonstrations – Bashir, 75, is a long-time fixture who seems to have outstayed his welcome.Bashir has battled international ostracism and western sanctions since being accused by the ICC of overseeing a genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s that killed an estimated 300,000 people. In a  interview in his Khartoum palace in 2011, he denied the charges.The decades-long war that ended with South Sudan’s independence in 2011 also weakened Bashir’s leadership and deprived Khartoum of vital oil revenues. NCP mismanagement and corruption have helped bring Sudan’s economy to its knees.New generations of Sudanese, including doctors, engineers and younger party members frustrated by multiple governance failures, have plainly run out of patience, as have impoverished urban workers. Hence the persistent anti-Bashir protests in many town and cities, the biggest since 2013.The latest round of demonstrations began in December, sparked by a sharp rise in the price of bread. But unrest quickly took on a political complexion, with demands for Bashir’s resignation and an end to NCP hegemony.Despite vicious and uncoordinated attempts by the security forces to halt the protests – Human Rights Watch says more than 50 people have died – and a half-hearted offer of dialogue by Bashir, demonstrations continued at the weekend. So far, however, the protesters lack leaders or clear objectives, let alone a plan for a post-Bashir era.Opposition is focused, in part, on proposed constitutional changes that would allow Bashir to stand for re-election in 2020. These have now been deferred. But Bashir could yet run again – if he obtains NCP backing – and has meanwhile placed the entire country under de facto martial law.As in 2011, when emergencies were declared in several provinces to quell unrest, this entails additional army deployments, roadblocks to control civilian population movement, arbitrary arrests and seizures, media censorship and bans on anti-regime political groups. Security forces can and do act with impunity.It is unlikely the promotion of Harun, who may hope to become Bashir’s heir apparent, will bring radical change. Like his mentor, he holds uncompromising views on the challenges facing the country.Interviewed in 2008, Harun said he was innocent of crimes committed in Darfur when he was a minister of state. He claimed the allegations and Sudan’s problems were the product of an international conspiracy, and the ICC was an integral part of it.“It is another phase of international colonisation. It targets mainly the Africans,” he said. “The main aim of the white people in Africa at that time, the British and the Europeans, was to disseminate their culture and their traditions … Now there is a new imperial era, but this time it is led by the United States and supported by the Europeans.”Harun’s suspicious outlook, shared by many in Sudan, underscores the difficulties western countries face in trying to induce Bashir to halt the violence, allow a transitional government of national unity and, perhaps, bow out peacefully.That responsibility may fall to Sudan’s African partners, and Middle Eastern allies such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Turkey. So far there is no sign they will intervene."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809666.1551458972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fintan o toole the day the donald became forever the don","story":"In his cooperation with prosecutors, Michael D.

Parts of Wales and the Irish Sea coast of north-west England is where we could see 70 to 80 miles an hour.The strongest winds will be limited to parts of western England and Wales, but the warning area includes parts of the Midlands and over towards Yorkshire and Lincolnshire as well.But they probably wont see the strongest winds until the very back-end of Sunday going into Monday morning.Freya will have moved into the North Sea by rush hour on Monday morning, although there will likely be some residual impacts in its wake.We can expect some branches and a few trees being blown down and there\u0027s also scope for some tiles being blown from roofs and also some power cuts as well, Mr Snell said.What to expect:Injuries and danger to life from flying debris are possibleSome damage to buildings and trees, such as tiles blown from roofs and fallen branches, could happenRoad, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possibleSome roads and bridges may closePower cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverageInjuries and danger to life could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and propertiesMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Jason Kelly, said: Storm Freya undergoes rapid cyclogenesis late Saturday and early Sunday as it moves across the eastern Atlantic Ocean towards the British Isles, this means the area of low pressure will deepen quickly as it moves towards us. This is a developing situation and the track of Freya’s strongest winds could change over the next few days, so we are advising people to keep an eye on the latest forecast and warnings from the Met Office.Where winds are strongest we can expect significant disruption to travel, with damage to buildings and trees likely. It’ll be especially dangerous near coastal areas due to the wind whipping up large waves.When Storm Freya clears to the north east on Monday, it will be followed by a sustained period of unsettled weather, according to the Met Office. Just days after Britain\u0027s firefighters battled wildfires across the nation, temperatures are expected to once again dip below freezing next week.  There is very little chance of another mini-heatwave which saw Kew Gardens bask in 21C and Porthmadog in 20.8C heat this week. It was the first time ever there was a temperature of more than 20C recorded in winter, but it wasn\u0027t enough to make it the hottest February since records began in 1910. That title remains with the February of 1998.In September, the Met Office and Met Éireann revealed the list of storm names for the coming season.First introduced in 2015, this is the fourth year the Met Office and Met Éireann (the meteorological service in the Republic of Ireland) have jointly run the ‘Name our Storms’ scheme, aimed at raising awareness of severe weather before it hits.This first storm, which was male and named Ali, hit on September 19 last year. The second was female and named Bronagh and hit Britain a day later, lasting until September 21. The system follows the alternating malefemale pattern established by the US National Hurricane Center in the 1970s.Storm Callum and Storm Deirdre have both come and gone before the new year, Storm Erik was 2019\u0027s first on February 8 and 9 and now Storm Freya is the year\u0027s second. Here are the rest of the storm names for this season:Storm names for 201819Announcing the storm names back in September, Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Éireann, said: The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the Globe as well as here at home.While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us.As before, Met Éireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the  Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather.This season’s names have once again been compiled from a list of suggestions submitted by the public, choosing some of the most popular names but also selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and ersity of Britain and Ireland. As in previous years, Q, U, X, Y and Z will not be used, to comply with the international storm naming conventions.A storm will be named on the basis of \u0027medium\u0027 or \u0027high\u0027 potential impacts from wind but also include the potential impacts of rain and snow.So storms will be named for weather systems which is expected to result in the Met Office issuing an amber or red warning. These two warnings carry a potential risk to life. There\u0027s nothing British people enjoy more than talking about the weather and in 2015, they were given the chance to develop an even closer connection by giving names to major weather systems affecting the UK and Ireland.In September 2016, the Met Office invited members of the public to submit names for storms for autumnwinter 201516 by social media.The idea behind the pilot project was to help raise awareness of severe weather before it strikes and to ensure greater safety of the public.Attaching a name to a weather event has been found to help people track its progress, to allow people to prepare for and avoid danger and to make it easier to reference on social media.Didn\u0027t we already give names to storms?Before the new system was introduced, naming was random, with the same storm sometimes being referred to by several different names.The St Jude\u0027s Storm of October 2013, which led to the deaths of four people, was so-called because it was due to arrive on St Jude\u0027s Day.In Britain, we also hear about a number of ex-hurricanes that arrive at our shores from across the Atlantic.Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center. These lists are maintained and updated every year by the international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. There are six lists that are used in rotation.As with the US system, the new naming system in Britain runs through the alphabet with alternate male and female names.There are no storms that begin with the less common letters Q, U, X, Y or Z.The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is particularly deadly or costly, such as Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 2,000 lives in the United States and caused more than £65 billion in damage.If a storm is the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane that has moved across the Atlantic, the already established method of referring to it as, for example Ex-hurricane X, will continue.On March 9, 2016 there was heavy rainfall across south Wales and southwest England and widespread northwesterly gales.There were gusts of wind up to 70mph and rainfall totals were around 20-30mm.Many were confused as to why the winds were not given the name Storm Katie, the next name on the Met Office list after Storm Jake.Storms are named by the Met Office when medium or high impacts are forecast as a result of high winds.As the weather system on March 9 was expected to have a low impact, it did not meet the criteria for naming a storm and was therefore not named.Please review our commenting policyTony Blair says he feels a \u0026#39great deal of sympathy\u0026#39 for breakaway Labour MPsFrench poppy seed bread found to contain dangerous levels of opiumMigrants storm UK-bound ferry at port of CalaisShamima Begum\u0026#39s husband says he wants to live in Holland with wife and newborn sonComment: We\u0026#39re teaching our children to be self-soothing sissiesComment: Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we\u0026#39re more of a Sweden than a SingaporeComment: I knew Brexit would be a shambles, but I never could have predicted this messComment: Organ donation is a precious act - don\u0026#39t let it become an expected oneTanking economy, Belt and Road unraveling and Huawei: Why China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping faces his toughest year yetHouse of Lords spent thousands on NDAs for former staff who made allegations of sexual harassment and workplace bullyingChris Packham accuses property developer of setting \u0026#39wildlife traps\u0026#39US and South Korea scrap major military exercises to ease tensions with North HS2 plans to sign sweetheart wind farm deals would breach procurement rules, Tory peer warnsComment: British governments have lied about the EU for decades.

On Tuesday, gardeners found a baby owl perched on a tractor in St James\u0027s Park, marking the first discovery of its kind in the grounds in 12 years.Experts suggested a 30pc decline in tawny numbers was being caused by light pollution and urbanisation Mark Wasilewski, St James’s Park Manager, said: “Our gardeners were delighted to discover a baby tawny owl sat on their tractor, right in the centre of London. The last time we were aware of any breeding of these birds in St James’s Park was about 12 years ago when we observed four youngsters perched on a branch, although we don’t know where they bred.We don’t know if there are more youngsters or where they’ve bred but it may well be that our longer grass areas and meadows are encouraging them by providing habitat for small mammals as food source, ” he added.The conservation status of the tawny owl changed from green to amber last yearTawny owls are stocky, medium-sized birds, equivalent in shape to the common woodpigeon, which are usually seen in woodland as well as urban parks and suburban gardens.Their trademark twit-twoo is a combination of the female call, described as a “kewick” sound, and the male’s response, a long and wavering hoot. Royal Parks officials suspect sightings of the nocturnal birds will become more commonplace with callings heard more frequently over the past 18 months.Paul Stancliffe, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: It is great to hear that Tawny Owls are once again breeding in The Royal Parks after an absence of more than a decade. Hopefully, when we crunch the numbers from this winter\u0027s Tawny Owl survey we will see this reflected elsewhere in the country, and a welcome upturn in this beautiful owl\u0027s fortunes. A baby was spotted in the Royal parks for the first time in more than a decadeThe conservation status of the tawny owl changed from green to amber last year, signalling a growing concern for the species.The Tawny Owl Calling Survey, which is running again this year until 31 March, is hoped to help researchers locate where the birds are and to pinpoint the areas where the species was missing.An RSPB Spokesperson said:“It’s brilliant to hear that tawny owls are breeding again in St. James’s Park. It just goes to show how important our urban green spaces are for both wildlife and people.”Please review our commenting policyTony Blair says he feels a \u0026#39great deal of sympathy\u0026#39 for breakaway Labour MPsFrench poppy seed bread found to contain dangerous levels of opiumMigrants storm UK-bound ferry at port of CalaisShamima Begum\u0026#39s husband says he wants to live in Holland with wife and newborn sonComment: We\u0026#39re teaching our children to be self-soothing sissiesComment: Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we\u0026#39re more of a Sweden than a SingaporeComment: I knew Brexit would be a shambles, but I never could have predicted this messComment: Organ donation is a precious act - don\u0026#39t let it become an expected oneTanking economy, Belt and Road unraveling and Huawei: Why China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping faces his toughest year yetUK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds Chris Packham accuses property developer of setting \u0026#39wildlife traps\u0026#39House of Lords spent thousands on NDAs for former staff who made allegations of sexual harassment and workplace bullyingUS and South Korea scrap major military exercises to ease tensions with North HS2 plans to sign sweetheart wind farm deals would breach procurement rules, Tory peer warnsComment: British governments have lied about the EU for decades.

What has become of the agencies who should protect life from this? Is everything spent?”He added that “if I were there I would rip those nets down. Do it.”A mystery activist has now removed some of the netting, with the developers claiming whoever vandalised the mesh is responsible for any birds becoming trapped.Campaigners are angry that the netting was installed before North Lincolnshire Council has ruled on whether the development should even go ahead.Councillor Paul McCartan, of Winterton Town Council, said the developers carried out the work so if the application is approved later this month they can begin construction without delay.“This shows a high level of arrogance because before a final decision has even been made they have gone in thinking they are going to win and consequently put up the netting,” he said.“It’s an example of developers riding roughshod over local communities.”He added that the site earmarked for development was inhabited by endangered bats and hedgehogs. The issue has been reported to the RSPCA and RSPB.A spokesman for Partner Construction said the netting was installed by ecologists to ensure birds and other wildlife were not harmed.“Were the scheme to be approved in the next few weeks, it is probable that birds would have begun nesting in the hedge, delaying the project to deliver much needed affordable housing.“So, rather than rip out the hedge, which was an option, we took the environmentally responsible decision to net it.This means, that if the scheme does not receive approval the hedge can be returned to its natural use. Meanwhile there are plenty of other places nearby which are suitable for nesting.“We commissioned properly qualified and experienced ecologists to carry out the work on our behalf. They have assured us and provided photographic evidence there were no birds in the hedgerow after it was netted and that the cover was left in a secure condition, preventing birds from gaining access.“Regrettably, we’ve now seen evidence, through images shared on social media, that the netting has been tampered with and damaged. It has been cut, opened and then closed again with pull ties. Whoever did this is responsible for distress caused to any birds which may have subsequently got inside and become trapped.”More than 200 letters against the application for the homes to be built just south of Winterton have been lodged with the local authority. The application was submitted in September for 40 homes, including 25 affordable properties.Please review our commenting policyTony Blair says he feels a \u0026#39great deal of sympathy\u0026#39 for breakaway Labour MPsFrench poppy seed bread found to contain dangerous levels of opiumMigrants storm UK-bound ferry at port of CalaisShamima Begum\u0026#39s husband says he wants to live in Holland with wife and newborn sonComment: We\u0026#39re teaching our children to be self-soothing sissiesComment: Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we\u0026#39re more of a Sweden than a SingaporeComment: I knew Brexit would be a shambles, but I never could have predicted this messComment: Organ donation is a precious act - don\u0026#39t let it become an expected oneTanking economy, Belt and Road unraveling and Huawei: Why China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping faces his toughest year yetUK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds House of Lords spent thousands on NDAs for former staff who made allegations of sexual harassment and workplace bullyingUS and South Korea scrap major military exercises to ease tensions with North HS2 plans to sign sweetheart wind farm deals would breach procurement rules, Tory peer warnsComment: British governments have lied about the EU for decades.

To the world, he looked an unstoppable strong man.This year, Mr Xi will stride into the Great Hall of the People in far tougher times – the economy is seeing its poorest economic growth in nearly three decades, hampered by a protracted trade war with the US.Beijing is also seeing the first signs of a backlash over its \u0027Belt and Road\u0027 plan - an infrastructure-led plan intended to boost its global clout - as partner countries cancel or reconsider previously agreed projects over debt concerns.Foreign governments are meanwhile pressuring Beijing on everything from espionage to human rights.“People are going into this now, not with a positive sense that China is really arriving, but with this concern of, \u0027are the wheels going to come off the bus?\u0027, or \u0027are things going to be ok?\u0027” said Benjamin Cavender, a principal at China Market Research, a consultancy.“They’re in damage control mode right now.” Mr Xi will need to seize the opportunity to reassure the nation by sending the right message, even though this year’s “lianghui”, meaning “two sessions”, is expected again to be a highly scripted piece of political theatre – big on pomp and circumstance with no major surprises.Premier Li Keqiang is set to deliver a statement on China\u0026#39s finances on Tuesday“There’s a lot of anxiety at the moment, so I suspect this year will really be about this oasis of calm in the midst of a typhoon of uncertainty,” said Kerry Brown, professor of China studies at King’s College London.“Whether people buy into that or not, the show will go on.” The annual meeting will see 3,000 delegates gather in Beijing to discuss political and economic policy, before casting votes that approve proposals from the ruling Communist Party.One piece of legislation expected to pass is a foreign investment law that would ban forced technology transfer and government “interference.”On Tuesday, Li Keqiang, China’s premier, will give a state-of-the-union style address, recapping last year’s achievements and looking forward to the next. He will also announce economic growth targets, expected to be set at 6.0 to 6.5 percent expansion for 2019, a hair\u0027s breadth lower than the 6.6 percent growth the economy posted last year.Behind the scenes, managing expectations will likely be a key theme, especially when it comes to supporting economic growth and handling the trade war - including what concessions Beijing will agree in order to get a deal done.Tech firm Huawei, which is the subject of international hacking fears, looks set to play a central role in Beijing\u0026#39s plan to roll out a nationwide 5G telecommunications networkCarl Weinberg, chief international economist at research firm High Frequency Economics, said that while Mr Xi will have control of the agenda, “one cannot rule out the chance that party hardliners will compel him not to concede a single millimetre to US demands that China abandon the state subsidy model.” This model underpins the Made in China 2025 initiative, designed to spur domestic growth but also criticised as a import-substitution plan. Entrepreneurs have also been upset with Mr Xi’s handling of economic reforms, which have largely favoured inefficient, wasteful state-owned enterprises over more nimble, private sector firms. The place of the defence budget on the government\u0027s priority list given the country\u0027s economic woes will be telling and give indication of China’s strategic intentions for modernising its military. China is also expected to outline plans for the rollout of 5G mobile networks, a development that will be aided by Huawei, a tech firm at the centre of a global spying row and the country\u0027s top supplier of 5G chips.How China tiptoes around this – or doesn’t – will provide some sense of how confident Beijing is in battling global concerns of hacking and espionage.“There’s a lot of fear right now that China is sort of hand-in-glove in a lot of the tech leaders in China,” Mr Cavender said.“There’s a real fear that they’re going to be giving information to the Chinese government – true or not, there’s a perception here, and that’s also hurting China’s image overseas.And despite the challenges ahead for Mr Xi, there won’t likely be dissenting opinions.“He’s definitely weaker, but that’s just politics,” Mr Brown said. “Xi’s political maneuvering before has made sure when he hits these periods of tougher fortunes, there is still no alternative – it’s got to be just him, and his leadership.”It will, however, be interesting to see if Mr Xi dominates the airwaves or if other senior officials like Mr Li or Liu He, China’s chief trade negotiator, play a role in embellishing the monologue.Please review our commenting policyTony Blair says he feels a \u0026#39great deal of sympathy\u0026#39 for breakaway Labour MPsFrench poppy seed bread found to contain dangerous levels of opiumMigrants storm UK-bound ferry at port of CalaisShamima Begum\u0026#39s husband says he wants to live in Holland with wife and newborn sonComment: We\u0026#39re teaching our children to be self-soothing sissiesComment: Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we\u0026#39re more of a Sweden than a SingaporeComment: I knew Brexit would be a shambles, but I never could have predicted this messComment: Organ donation is a precious act - don\u0026#39t let it become an expected oneUK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds Chris Packham accuses property developer of setting \u0026#39wildlife traps\u0026#39House of Lords spent thousands on NDAs for former staff who made allegations of sexual harassment and workplace bullyingUS and South Korea scrap major military exercises to ease tensions with North HS2 plans to sign sweetheart wind farm deals would breach procurement rules, Tory peer warnsComment: British governments have lied about the EU for decades.

south korea scrap major military exercises ease tensions","story":"U.S. Army soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division\u0026#39s 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team and a South Korean Army soldier participate in a demonstration of the combined arms live-fire exercise during the annual joint military exercise Foal EagleThe US and South Korea announced on Sunday an end to their annual large-scale military exercises in support of diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme.The decision comes days after the conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, which ended without a formal agreement but with both sides suggesting they would keep talking.There are close to 30,000 US troops stationed in South Korea, and their annual drills with tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers have been a perennial target of North Korean fury – with Pyongyang condemning the manoeuvres as provocative rehearsals for invasion.While Mr Trump has ruled out withdrawing the troops, he has repeatedly complained about the cost of the exercises, describing them at a press conference in Hanoi as very, very expensive.During a Saturday phone call between South Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and his US counterpart Patrick Shanahan, both sides decided to conclude the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle series of exercises, according to a Pentagon statement.Foal Eagle is the biggest of the regular joint exercises held by the allies.In the past, it has involved 200,000 South Korean forces and some 30,000 US soldiers.It is accompanied by Key Resolve, a computer-simulated war game conducted by military commanders which usually begins in March and runs for about 10 days.The two allies will instead carry out adjusted outside manoeuvre trainings and united command exercises to continue firm military readiness, Seoul’s defence ministry said Sunday.The decision was reached to support ongoing diplomatic efforts for North Korea’s denuclearisation and ease military tensions with the North, it added.South Korea’s foreign ministry said that Lee Do-hoon, Seoul’s chief nuclear envoy, will leave for Washington to hold talks with his US counterpart Stephen Biegun.Lee will fly sometime this week, ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk told AFP.Lee and Biegun are expected to discuss the Hanoi summit, which failed to build on the vaguely-worded commitment to denuclearise the Korean peninsula signed by Kim and Trump during their meeting in Singapore last year.Opponents of scrapping the drills have warned that it could impact the combat readiness of the combined US and South Korean forces and hand the North a strategic advantage on the ided peninsula, but most analysts said such concerns were exaggerated.Suspending or downgrading the US-South Korean drills may hurt the readiness of the two militaries, but I don’t think it’s going to be a serious security threat to South Korea, Ahn Chan-il, the president of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in Seoul, told AFP.U.S. Army\u0026#39s Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters fly during a combined arms live-fire exercise during the annual joint military exercise Foal EagleThe South’s conventional forces outclass the North’s, and given the current situation (with the US and the existing sanctions), it’s highly unlikely that Pyongyang will do anything with its nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future, he added.Retired General Vincent Brooks, a former commander of US forces in South Korea who helped organise Trump’s first meeting with Kim in Singapore, said last year that any end to joint training would not hinder the Pentagon’s combat-readiness on the peninsula.Perhaps we’ve been told for now to put our sword back into its sheath, but we have not been told to forget how to use it, he said.Washington has sought to end long-running tensions on the peninsula and encourage North Korea to scrap its nuclear programme.Since the Singapore summit, the US and Seoul have scaled back or scrapped several joint military drills, and US bombers are no longer flying over South Korea.Not downgrading or suspending the drills at this point ... would mean the involved countries are not serious about reaching a denuclearisation accord, said University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin.Please review our commenting

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work. Its authors, Fraser McKevitt and Ray Gaul, are to be commended.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Overnight, it robbed him of his confidence and his work as a commercial tyre fitter. He became housebound, unable even to make a cup of tea, and so depressed that one evening he found himself on a bridge near his home in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales, contemplating suicide.\u0026nbspThat was four years ago. Now Mr Ricketts is helping other people suffering from disabilities and loneliness with the Llanelli Visually Impaired Bowls Club. The bowls club has flourished since Mr Ricketts founded it in 2016. This year, they are raising money to attend a national championship in Weston-Super-Mare.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts is also working with the local Men’s Sheds\u0026nbspcharity and\u0026nbspStreet Buddies, a volunteer scheme for residents to get involved in the community. For some of this work, he is paid in time credits, a form of community currency that can be exchanged for tickets to concerts and access to parks and leisure centres.“It’s given me a real boost,” he says. “It’s a way to pay people for help without using money and it makes me feel really good, because I’m giving something back.”What is Venezuela’s new currency system?The stock exchange for goods and skills in GlasgowTime credits in the UK are issued by Tempo (formerly known as Spice). The charity was founded in 2008 at the the Wales Institute for Community Currencies. In their original form, time credits were an experiment to help rebuild\u0026nbspthe ex-mining communities of south Wales.Time credits offer an alternative way to reward work that is traditionally unpaid at a time when local authorities are relying on communities to step in and provide care for the lonely and vulnerable. They should never replace paid work, but time credits\u0026nbspmight give meaning or value to an exchange with a person with disabilities, mental health or addiction issues who could struggle to take part in the monetary economy.\u0026nbspIn times of crisis, such as in Argentina at the turn of the millennium or during the Greek financial crisis, barter economies and community currencies can facilitate exchanges between people when the monetary economy fails. \u0026nbspSome 50,000 people have since earned 700,000 time credits since 2008. Mr Ricketts says the scheme has huge potential in areas of low income by helping community groups give back to volunteers. Families awarded time credits can use the scheme to take advantage of daytrips and leisure activities that might otherwise be beyond their reach.\u0026nbsp“I have seen the potential of them for families with low incomes,” he says. He has been known to give some of his own time credits to people when he sees them counting the pennies to buy a cup of tea.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts always keeps some time credits in his pockets. Given his condition, that can cause confusion. “They look and feel like the new plastic fivers,” he says. “Because I can’t see I have been known to try and pay for a pint with time credits in the pub.”Similar schemes around the UK encourage people to swap their time or labour for time in kind. In Hull, the HullCoin rewards people for getting involved in community action with a digital currency that can be used to get discounts with local businesses. Many cities also have a time-banking network co-ordinated by Timebanking UK. Time-banking is rooted in the idea that every person has something to contribute to their community, regardless of their circumstances.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Ian Merrill worked in health and social care for 20 years before he became the chief executive of Tempo in 2017. He says time credits are a way to enable people like Stephen Ricketts to take a role in their community by recognising the efforts that go into volunteering. The scheme also gets new people into volunteering. Half of people earning time credits have have volunteered before.“People volunteer for its own sake and that’s fine,” Mr Merrill says. “But we know that time credits bring people into volunteering who wouldn’t already do it.”\u0026nbspMr Ricketts says he uses time credits at bowls to thank personal assistants for extra jobs, like making a round of tea, putting out biscuits for the players, or cleaning up afterwards. “After a bit of time, I found out the assistants had children and they were taking them swimming, so when they wanted to take their family out to a leisure part or a theatre, I gave them the time credits to cover it,” he says.Volunteers can currently spend their time credits golfing at Pembrey Park in Wales, learning to paddleboard in Essex, or on hair and beauty treatments at participating salons. They can also be exchanged for short courses at some college and classes to learn how to act or how to cook healthier meals.What really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Simon, whose last name is withheld, earned his first time credits with the Haringey Project, which helps people with mental health problems or substance misuse. He earned credits volunteering with gardening when he lived in St Mungo’s Hostel for two years. With the credits he earned, he took his mother on outings to Tower Bridge, Keat’s House and Kensington Palace.\u0026nbsp“I’ve taken my mum to places she’s never been to before,” he says. “I went on lots of trips with time credits this August, it was the best August of my whole life.”Tempo is now looking at harnessing technology to bring time credits to more people. Mr Merrill says time credits could become ever more important in the UK during tightened economic circumstances. “Time credits enables people to address needs in their own communities,” he says. “If they can help unlock capacity and create connections that weren’t there before, those are good things.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He told me he had once picked up a distressed woman from a nightclub, late at night, and she told him she had just been sexually assaulted by a north African immigrant.After taking a few moments to digest this, I asked the obvious question: “But what’s that got to do with Brexit?” He had barely begun answering before he accidentally drove through a red light, triggering a camera flash. This was going to cost him.\u0026nbspFor an Australian, getting to understand Brexit has been a process of getting to understand the English. I had a slight advantage on some of my compatriots. I was born in England, though my family moved to seek sun, sand and work after the winter of discontent in 1978-79 when I was a child.\u0026nbspI retain enough Englishness (and English relatives) to appreciate the lingering distrust of the continent and its people, the instinctive rejection of the post-war plan for all Europe to join in an ode to joy and brotherhood.

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fans of trade deals. As a self-aware “middle power”, we know that we prosper through alliances. We have few empire romances to fall back on (though we have the Commonwealth\u0026nbspmore of that later). We instinctively seek to draw ourselves closer to our neighbours, friends and trading partners through deals and forums.\u0026nbspFarage (AFPGetty)The sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surprise.From the start there was an immediate interest from our readers – reflected in the below-the-article arguments and in article click-throughs. I soon found myself writing seemingly endless updates, analysis pieces and weekend news reads on this technical, political spasm on the other side of the world.In the pre-Trump era Brexit was the international focus for a global trend: the rise of nationalism, the disillusionment with globalism, the fear of “uncontrolled”\u0026nbspmigration.\u0026nbspThese factors have been playing out in Australia too, though with different timing and emphasis.\u0026nbspWe managed to make it through the financial crisis more or less unscathed, so the economic triggers for Brexit were alien to us, or at least less relatable.As tensions rise with China, Brexit seems more dangerous than ever Australian salaries are high and public services pretty robust. But our housing availabilityaffordability bubble is as bad as Britain’s, with similar knock-on effects for quality of life.\u0026nbspOur migration “crisis”\u0026nbspcame in 2001, with a surge in the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Our then centrist, populist prime minister John Howard seized the moment to proclaim: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”It was a resonant phrase. Like the best political slogans it was impossible to argue with, defending controversial politics with impenetrable rhetoric.\u0026nbspWhen Australians heard the Brexiteer slogan “take back control”\u0026nbspwe immediately recognised what was going on.Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fastDavid Cameron could have taken a leaf from Howard’s playbook. When Howard was confronted with an irresistible push for a referendum in the late Nineties (on Australia becoming a republic, which Howard strongly opposed), he responded with a process ingeniously designed to undermine it: first, a national convention to agree on a model that was inevitably going to be a compromise nobody liked, then a vote in which half the people who wanted a republic would vote against it because it wasn’t the republic they had imagined. Sadly, Howard didn’t offer this advice or Cameron didn’t seek it.So the campaign began. As a foreign correspondent I rarely had to report the daily tennis match. This avoided much of the problem faced by domestic media: the failure of “he said, she said”\u0026nbspjournalism when confronted with daily exaggerations and concoctions from campaigners, and the rejection of expertise.\u0026nbspInstead, my editors wanted to know what was driving public opinion. Not quite a forecast of the result, but understanding of, whichever way it fell, why it had fallen that way.My initial theory was that it would shake out much like the 2014 Scottish referendum. It was to be nationalistic passion and vague promises of future benefits, up against a well-organised steamrolling campaign of warnings about the inevitable costs and risks.Farage says he would rather \u0027go on holiday\u0027 than vote in a second Brexit referendumThe sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surpriseBut then I met an insightful\u0026nbspBrussels thinktank chief, whose depressing logic completely changed my mind.\u0026nbspFabian Zuleeg told me the above theory was “plausible… but not one I believe in”. He asked the simple question: “Who’s going to campaign against Brexit?”Business would be reticent, worried about spooking shareholders. Much of the media were scathingly Eurosceptic. Trade unions were never really on board with the EU. Labour was ided. Cameron was on the nose with voters and had for years (like many of his colleagues) used the EU and immigration as a political punch bag. On the other side were figures like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: stump speakers with mass appeal. I’d met Farage. I understood why he was political catnip.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite frightening,” the thinktank chief said. “If you look at the general attitudes towards migration (in the UK) it’s intensely negative and I think this is going to drive a lot of this agenda.”For an Australian to lecture the UK on political self-harm is, of course, the height of hypocrisy. We’ve changed prime ministers six times in the past 11 years, only twice as the result of an election, and we’re quite likely to do it again in 2019. And if any country is going to sympathise with a nation torn by an endless debate over migration, it’s Australia.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the referendum, though, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull channelled the mood of much of our country: bemused tolerance.\u0026nbsp“If the British people, in their wisdom, decide to stay in the European Union then we would welcome that,” he said a month or so ahead of the vote.\u0026nbspTheresa May to meet opposition leaders as Labour snubs offer of talks More than 170 business leaders urge May to back second referendumCorbyn will do no better than May when it comes to BrexitThere was self-interest too, Turnbull said. Australian businesses like to base in the UK and take advantage of access to the EU.\u0026nbspAnd Australia as a member of the Five Eyes group, sharing intelligence with the UK, felt from a security point of view it was “an unalloyed plus for Britain to remain in the EU”.Then came the vote.\u0026nbsp“We respect the wishes of the British people,” Turnbull said afterwards. Rather optimistically, he added: “I have no doubt that in due course, the British government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union.”Privately, he held a different view. After being deposed, at a private speech in November 2018, Turnbull said what he really thought.\u0026nbspBrexit was a “catastrophe”, he said – a decision “not even understood by the government, let alone by the people. It was absolutely uninformed consent.”Nevertheless, a significant faction of conservative Australian politics\u0026nbsp(including the then high commissioner in London) threw itself\u0026nbspenthusiastically behind Brexit.\u0026nbspSince the vote, then, our official attitude has essentially been:\u0026nbsp“Ok, what’s in it for us?”\u0026nbspMost obviously, there’s a trade deal. Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fast.\u0026nbspWe’re a relatively minor trading partner for the UK (compared with, say, the US), so there’s less at stake and the UK can use us as a kind of training ground before it takes on the ruthless brainboxes from Washington DC. And there’s the Commonwealth link. Brexiteers imagined Commonwealth ties as a\u0026nbspbasis for post-Brexit UK’s international identity.\u0026nbspAustralia is happy to play along with this, especially as Brexiteers seem to think the Commonwealth consists entirely of Australia, New Zealand and Canada.And, finally, it feels like a historical revenge served cold. When the UK joined the EU it triggered a dramatic change in UK-AU trade.\u0026nbspWe lost a market, and it forced us to refocus on our region. In a way it was a favour: Australia prospered hugely from its growing ties to the developing economies to our north.\u0026nbsp But some (especially the older, more Anglophile corner of conservative politics) have never forgotten this slight. When Britain comes begging for post-Brexit favours, it will be a sweet moment indeed.Nick Miller has been the Europe correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in London, since 2013We’ll tell you what’s true.

Actually, it’s a two-man show: most of the landscape paintings in this exhibition are by David Hockney, but they’re juxtaposed with landscapes by one of his great artistic heroes: Vincent van Gogh.“He’s one of the great, great draughtsmen of all time,”Hockney, fielding questions from a crowd of journalists, who’ve flown in from all around the world. “The drawings are fantastic – he could see space very clearly.” And the paintings are something else. “Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really look.”Hockney is wearing a natty flat cap and a lime green cardigan – he’s always been a stylish dresser. He seems cheerful and contented – he’s always been comfortable in his own skin. However he looks older and frailer than he did a few years ago, and he talks a lot more slowly. This should come as no surprise – he is 81, after all – but somehow it’s still a shock. With his boyish good looks, he was the Peter Pan of Pop Art. Even in late middle age, he seemed a lot younger than his years. Now he finally looks his age, but we should be thankful he’s still alive and still painting. If Van Gogh had lived as long as Hockney, he would have still been alive in the 1930s.“I’ve been deeply influenced by Van Gogh – it’s very visible in this show,” he says. “Van Gogh, to me, is a contemporary artist. Any artist that speaks to you is a contemporary artist. Brueghel is a contemporary artist to me.” Another big influence in his life has been Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. “They’re marvellous,” he says. “If it had been 10 years later he might have been on the phone and the letters wouldn’t exist.”Hockney’s first encounter with Van Gogh was back in 1955, when he was a student at Bradford School of Art. The art school arranged a trip to a Van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, and Hockney was blown away by the energy, the vitality, the joie de vivre of his paintings. “I was 16 years old and I’d just started at the art school,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Well, he’s quite a rich artist, because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky’. Not even teachers at the art school could afford that!”Created with Sketch.David Hockney\u0027s first brushes with genius Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)It was the colour that moved him most of all. “I’d never seen paintings like that before – at the art school everybody just painted grey pictures of Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I thought he’d probably exaggerated some colour, but now I don’t think so.” Sixty-four years later, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world’s largest collection of Van Gogh’s work, has had the bright idea of juxtaposing a large array of Hockney’s Yorkshire landscape paintings with a smaller selection of Van Gogh’s landscapes, painted in the 1880s in the south of France. Hockney is flattered by this association. “Van Gogh is a terrific inspiration.”Of course there are some similarities between Van Gogh’s woods and wheat fields and Hockney’s, but this show isn’t about narrow comparisons, of style or subject matter. It’s about their shared love of light. Above all, it’s about their lust for life. They’re both artists who adore the natural world, and paint it compulsively. “They’re just so joyful,” he says, of Van Gogh’s landscapes. You could say the same of his. Fittingly, the show is called The Joy of Nature.As Hockney says, it’s a far better title than Dave and Vince. It’s ironic that such joyful paintings were made by a man who chose to kill himself, but that paradox is part of what makes Van Gogh so compelling. “He was joyful when he painted – I know that, because that’s what he loved.”‘Kilham to Langtoft II’, 27 July 2005, oil on canvas (David Hockney)This exhibition also represents a kind of renaissance, for Hockney’s landscape paintings, like Van Gogh’s, were cut short by a tragic, self-inflicted death. In March 2013, one of Hockney’s assistants, Dominic Elliott, died from drinking toilet cleaner in Hockney’s home in Bridlington, the Yorkshire seaside town where Hockney had been living intermittently since the early Noughties. Hockney was entirely blameless, but he’d been asleep in the house when it happened, and the shock was immense. He sold the house and moved back to Los Angeles, his adopted home for the past 30 years. For several months, he was unable to paint at all.In July 2013 Hockney sent a picture to his friend and curator Edith Devaney. It was a portrait of his close friend and studio manager, Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima, sitting in Hockney’s LA studio, his head buried in his hands. Straight away, Devaney spotted the similarity with Van Gogh’s Old Man in Sorrow. This wasn’t just a portrait, Hockney told her – it was also a sort of self-portrait.This portrait led to many more, and the result was his 2016 exhibition, 82 Portraits and One Still Life, at London’s Royal Academy, curated by Devaney. After the trauma of Elliot’s sudden death, Van Gogh helped to bring Hockney back into painting. And now Van Gogh has brought his Yorkshire landscapes, cruelly curtailed by that tragic accident, back to life.Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really lookThe selection was mainly made by the Van Gogh Museum, but Hockney did ask them to include The Road to York through Sledmere, which he painted a decade earlier, as homage to his friend Jonathan Silver. Silver revived Salts Mill in Saltaire, Yorkshire, as a cultural centre (and as a museum of Hockney’s work). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997, aged just 48. When Silver was very ill, Hockney spent a lot of time with him.He asked Silver if there was anything he could do for him. Silver asked him to paint east Yorkshire – a subtler landscape than West Yorkshire, where Hockney was born and raised. “That picture was painted when Jonathan Silver was dying, and I was driving constantly from Bridlington to Saltaire, and I always went through Sledmere,” remembers Hockney. “It’s always been on my wall.”English landscape paintings are often muted, a blur of browns and greys. Hockney’s English landscapes are glowing – bursting with bright colours and brilliant light. “I’d lived in California for 30 years. It’s bound to have an effect. But I don’t think I exaggerated the colour that much – no, I don’t think so. I think it’s there, but you have to look – hard. Colour is a very fugitive thing.”As he says, we all see colour differently. Some people see it more intensely. Hockney’s intense vision makes us look closer and the world look brighter. “When you’re looking at the world, there’s so much to see.”David Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the fourth of five children. During the war his father Kenneth was a conscientious objector, which meant that when he lost his job, as a clerk, he wasn’t eligible for national assistance. He subsequently scratched a living renovating old prams. David drew from an early age, in chalk on the kitchen floor and in pencil in his brothers’ comics.In 1947 he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School. He didn’t shine at school, which was just as well. If he’d been top of the class his teachers might have pushed him into a more respectable occupation. “He should realise that ability in and enthusiasm for art alone is not enough to make a career for him,” wrote his teacher on his school report.Fortunately for Hockney, and the rest of us, he paid no attention to his teachers. He went to Bradford College of Art, which gave him a solid foundation in skills like life drawing, then on to the Royal College of Art, in London, where he found his voice. He came out as gay – a brave move in an era when homosexuality was still illegal – and his work blossomed. He made his first visit to America, and returned with his hair dyed blonde, after seeing a TV ad for Clairol which claimed that “blondes have more fun”.By the time Hockney left the Royal College he was already represented by a Bond Street gallery. He moved into a two-room flat in London’s Notting Hill, still a rundown area back then. He slept in one room and used the other room as his studio. His immense talent was bolstered by his insatiable appetite for hard work. GET UP AND WORK IMMEDIATELY was painted in big block capitals on the chest of drawers at the foot of his bed.His first solo show in 1963 earned him enough money to spend a year in America. As he told his friend Henry Geldzahler, he never felt lonely over there. He spent some time in New York but he was drawn to Los Angeles, where he’s lived, off and on, ever since.“Southern California has a marvellous clarity in the light. That’s why Hollywood is there. I always loved the place. I never got bored of it.” The sun-drenched pictures he painted there would have been inconceivable in Britain. “In a cold place like Bradford you hardly see anybody without their clothes on,” he once remarked.Hockney painting ‘May Blossom on the Roman Road’, 2009 (Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima)Then as now, LA is commonly derided by snobbish Brits (and New Yorkers) as a spiritual desert, devoid of culture, but Hockney saw a vivid, lively cityscape that no one else had painted, a city with “the only architecture in the world that makes you smile”. He took to calling himself an “English Los Angeleno”. He vowed to become the “Pirinesi of LA”.His LA paintings made his name, in Britain and America, particularly his swimming pool pictures like A Bigger Splash and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which last year became the most expensive painting by a living artist when it sold at Christie’s in New York for $90m (£68m).David Hockney interview: \u0027I thought I was a peripheral artist, really\u0027“The auction prices for my work have nothing to do with me – I ignore it,” he says, emphatically. “I think people have forgotten Oscar Wilde’s remark, ‘The only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer’.”He’s worked in all kinds of media, from film and photography to set design. He’s embraced every new innovation, from fax machines to smartphones. His iPad paintings were groundbreaking, proving that this new medium could be a new way to make great art.“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window, and I realised that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed. I didn’t have to get up to get water, or a brush, or pencils, and I could draw in the dark, because of the back light, so I started drawing just before the dawn.” He painted dozens of pictures of the sun rising, on his iPad, through the same bedroom window. “Every day was different, different colours. No two sunrises are the same.”Woldgate’, 2008, oil on 2 canvases (David Hockney)Yet despite his love of hi-tech, he’ll always be remembered as a painter, and a traditional painter at that. “Modern art generally ignores skills and crafts,” he once said, in an interview with Art Monthly. When abstract art was all the rage he flew the flag for figuration. When conceptual art was all the rage he flew the flag for fine art.“There’s a lot of the boring old northern art schoolmaster in what he says about representation versus abstraction,” wrote Tim Hilton, in . But as a new generation of artists rediscover draughtsmanship, it seems Hockney has been proved right.Despite his conventional views on art, he’s no reactionary fuddy-duddy. He was a tireless advocate for gay rights, long before such causes became chic. His friend Henry Geldzahler once wrote down a list of his faults and failings: stubborn hard of hearing unintentionally rude suffers fools gladly generous to a fault. It’s notable that several of these faults are actually virtues.It’s hard to find an artist who’s so universally admired. And after all these years, his hunger for experience remains. “On Saturday I’m going off to Normandy to paint the arrival of spring,” he says. “I can’t think of anything better than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019.”Hockney – Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature is at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (vangoghmuseum.nl) until 26 MayWe’ll tell you what’s true.

AI is everywhere, its proponents claim – if it\u0027s not somewhere already, then it\u0027s about to be.And the latest place it has arrived is perhaps the most personal yet: in your mouth. Oral B\u0027s latest toothbrush hopes to bring the power of AI and machine learning to your teeth, using artificial intelligence to coach you into brushing your teeth better.It\u0027s not the first toothbrush to use technology usually preserved for mobile phones and other gadgets to make sure your brushing is as effective as possible. But Oral-B thinks it is the smartest, and the brush has a fitting name: the Genius X.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe toothbrush was revealed in Barcelona this week at Mobile World Congress, an event usually focused on phones. This year, many of the exhibitions focused on foldable handsets and 5G.Oral-B staked its claim not only on the basis of its smart toothbrush but also its general vision of the future of healthcare and its connection to dental hygiene. That vision included a full-scale smart mirror, which could be controlled by people\u0027s hand movements and showed information about the day to come and the overall health of the person using it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth. Those scores can be viewed historically through the app, which also keeps data on things such as how often your gums bleed.The Genius X is due to be released later this year and pricing has not yet been announced.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This supports the merger model of black hole growth,” he said.The group’s results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Ms Wong made the discovery after coming across\u0026nbspthe words “Hide Tweet” in the app’s code, which Twitter later confirmed to be the new feature.“Thanks to Jane and @MattNavarra for starting the conversation about this feature we are developing. We wanted to provide a little more context on it,” Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter.“We often hear from heavy Tweeters that they want to be able to protect their conversations. People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start as healthy as possible by giving them some control.”Twitter is secretly keeping hold of deleted DMsTwitter is ‘thinking about’ a new edit featureMs Haq\u0026nbspexplained how Twitter categorises\u0026nbspconversations as an ecosystem containing\u0026nbspfour different groups: Authors, repliers, the audience and the platform. “We try to balance the experience across all four groups, and we are continuously exploring ways to shift the balance without overcorrecting.”She added: “We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original Tweeter and the audience.”Twitter said it planned\u0026nbspto start testing the new Hide Tweet feature publicly “in the coming months”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019. Members of the British Parliament are due to vote on Theresa May\u0027s  Brexit deal on 15 January 2019, with Britain set to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019.But speaking on ITV’s Peston\u0026nbspprogramme, the shadow chancellor and close ally of the Labour leader, also stressed: “We are still going to argue that we want a general election, we are still going to argue we think our deal that we have put up was the best option.”“But we realise...\u0026nbspwe have got to break this deadlock.”Minutes after losing the vote on his Brexit plans – by a margin of 240 to 323 votes – Mr Corbyn issued a statement, which said: “We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspThree-quarters of graduates think Brexit will negatively impact careerCorbyn pressured to move to new referendum after Brexit plan defeatedMPs lock in May’s promise that they can veto no-deal BrexitWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or general election.”\u0026nbspBut some raised concerns that the party could still dodge backing a Final Say, after frontbencher Richard Burgon tweeted: “Disappointing that Labour’s Brexit motion didn’t pass. But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The attorney general needs to give a legally binding guarantee that the backstop is temporary. Once we have that, my colleagues in parliament need to recognise the strength of feeling.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentJustice minister Rory Stewart also claimed that\u0026nbspa growing number of MPs were ready to back Ms May\u0027s plan.Asked if he was confident the deal\u0026nbspwould be approved by the Commons, he told Sky News\u0027\u0026nbspRidge on Sunday:\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspdon\u0027t think one can ever say that one is confident in\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspparticular world, but I\u0026nbspthink there\u0027s been a huge amount of movement.I think that people are becoming more pragmatic - they\u0027re recognising much more than they did in the past that there are a limited number of alternatives to this and that the alternatives are worse.MPs were also increasingly of the view that Ms May\u0027s deal will allow us to move on, it will give business certainty, it will bring investment into the country, he added.The European Research Group (ERG) of Eurosceptic Tories has established a panel of MP lawyers to assess wh​atever new compromise Mr Cox brings back from Brussels.The group has reportedly put together three tests that must be met in order to secure their support. According to the Sunday Times, they are: a clearly worded, legally binding, treaty-level clause that overrides the text of the\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement, wording that goes beyond\u0026nbspsimply re-emphasisingre-interpreting the temporary nature of the backstop, and a clear and unconditional route out of the backstop if trade talks fail.Ms May has said\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwill be given a choice between a no-deal Brexit and an extension to the Article 50 period if they reject her deal for a second time.But writing in the Sunday , foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Commons leader Andrea\u0026nbspLeadsom\u0026nbspsaid any delay to the\u0026nbspEU withdrawal would be a betrayal of Brexit.They wrote: Those who wish to embrace no deal are turning their backs on a far more attractive option in the PM\u0027s deal – avoiding disruption and uncertainty for businesses and our people.On the other hand, the active pursuit of a delay to Brexit – with no purpose beyond frustration – is a betrayal of the referendum result.Boost for Corbyn as Labour voters in party heartlands back Final Say Brexit now depends on Geoffrey Cox, Arlene Foster and Nigel DoddsBarnier: Brexit delay needed even if May gets deal through parliamentGrayling faces parliamentary inquiries amid fresh calls to resignIt would lead to an irretrievable breach of trust with those who are already cynical about the will of Westminster to deliver on the result to begin with.Their intervention is likely to be seen as an attack on pro-EU ministers including work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, justice secretary David\u0026nbspGauke\u0026nbspand business secretary Greg Clark, who have been privately calling for a delay in order to prevent a no-deal exit.On Saturday, EU chief negotiator Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid a delay to Brexit would be needed even if Ms May gets her deal through parliament this month.He said there is now not enough time for the EU to ratify the agreement before the UK is due to leave the bloc on 29 March.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

From early life and through much of her Army life, Manning was known as Bradley she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder while in the Army.Ms Manning’s attorneys have filed a motion to quash the subpoena.\u0026nbsp“I object strenuously to this subpoena, and to the grand jury process in general,” Ms\u0026nbspManning said in a statement.“We’ve seen this power abused countless times to target political speech. I have nothing to contribute to this case and I resent being forced to endanger myself by participating in this predatory practice.”The subpoena was signed last month by Gordon Kromberg, a national security prosecutor on the Assange case. Mr Kromberg last month persuaded a judge to leave sealed an indictment against Mr Assange despite its inadvertent exposure in an unrelated court filing last year.Under Mr Obama, Justice Department officials had decided not to pursue charges against Mr Assange and WikiLeaks after concluding that to do so could set a precedent that paved the way for prosecuting news organisations for publishing classified information. But the case got a fresh look under Donald Trump.\u0026nbspSteve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the Justice Department probably indicted Mr\u0026nbspAssange last year to stay within the 10-year statute of limitations on unlawful possession or publication of national defence information, and is now working to add charges.“There’s nothing else that would make sense,” he said.\u0026nbsp“The heart of the controversy is, there’s never been a successful prosecution” for publishing classified information, Mr Vladeck said. “There has always been the spectre of a First Amendment defence.”\u0026nbspPeter Zeidenberg, a national security defence attorney, said he cannot see grounds for Ms Manning to refuse the subpoena.Julian Assange rejects UK-Ecuador deal allowing him to leave embassyManafort ‘met with Assange in months before Wikileaks released emails’Julian Assange has been charged in US, prosecutors accidentally reveal“She’s already been prosecuted, she’s been convicted, she served a sentence,” he said. “She has no Fifth Amendment privilege over self-incrimination. If she doesn’t testify then she’ll be held in contempt.”\u0026nbspMs Manning appears to be the latest inidual subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating Mr\u0026nbspAssange in the Eastern District of Virginia.Last July, computer expert David House, who befriended Ms Manning in 2010 at a hacker space in Boston he founded, testified for 90 minutes before the grand jury.In an interview, Mr House said he met the WikiLeaks founder in January 2011 while Mr Assange was under house arrest at Ellingham Hall, a manor house 120 miles northeast of London.Mr Assange was fighting an extradition request by Sweden, where he faced an inquiry into allegations of sexual assault.Mr Assange asked Mr House to help run political operations for WikiLeaks in the United States. “Specifically, he wanted me to help achieve favourable press for Chelsea Manning,” he said.Mr House, who testified in exchange for immunity, said the grand jury was interested in his relationship with Mr\u0026nbspAssange.“They wanted full insight into WikiLeaks, what its goals were and why I was associated with it,” he said.“They wanted explanations of why certain things occurred and how they occurred... It was all related to disclosures around the war logs.”The grand jury seemed interested in whether Mr\u0026nbspAssange had solicited Ms Manning to hack on WikiLeaks’ behalf, but did not press “very hard” on that, he said.During her trial, Ms Manning testified that she acted on her own to send documents to WikiLeaks and no one associated with WikiLeaks pressured her into giving more information.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The SpaceX team in Hawthorne watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space Station\u0027s Harmony module.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

Some of her Facebook Live videos have received\u0026nbspas many as 2,000 views. She said she wears pyjamas because she says good night to them at the end of the video, and she wants to be “true to what I\u0027m saying”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach Tucked-in Tuesday begins with a roll call of sorts, as Dr George gives a shout-out to the students who have signed on and pop up on her screen. She has to be careful she pronounces every name correctly.“They\u0027ll come in the next day and tell me, \u0027You\u0027re saying my name wrong,\u0027” she said.This is the most important lesson you can teach your childHer readings promote family time, she says, because parents watch along with students (she calls them scholars rather than students). It\u0027s also interactive because Dr George asks questions for the children to answer as she reads.When she read the book “Ladybug Girl”, she slid on enormous ladybug wings and cuddled a large stuffed ladybug.

Dr George announces the reading grade level of each book, and her students can take an optional quiz about the book the following day as part of the school\u0027s reading comprehension curriculum.The evening she read “Ladybug Girl”, she came to a page where Ladybug Girl\u0027s brother says she can\u0027t play with him because she\u0027s too small. Dr George paused and looked into the camera.“How many of you have ever been told that you\u0027re too little to do something?” she asked. “I have three older sisters, and they used to tell me I was too little to do something.“But guess what?” she asked with a glint in her eye. “I did it anyway.”\u0026nbspHer audience laughed along with her.Dr George said 94 per cent of her students come from economically disadvantaged homes, and last year\u0027s literacy tests showed that an average of just 55 per cent of her third, fourth\u0026nbspand fifth-graders were reading on or above grade level.Created with Sketch. Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.She said since she became principal this school year, students have made strides in literacy. “We\u0027ve already seen growth,” she said.Dr George said she has a deep understanding of growing up in an economically disadvantaged home. She and her five siblings grew up in a three-bedroom trailer in Louisiana.Her father, who worked at a crawfish farm, dropped out of school in fifth grade to care for his father. Her mother stopped school in 11th grade.“My mom and dad were great parents,” she said, adding that they emphasised education even though they did not have a lot of it themselves. “My mom was a really smart lady.”\u0026nbspShe said she gives positive feedback to her students, and has high expectations, but also knows the importance of meeting them where they are. For example, she said she does not\u0026nbspwant students to feel like they have let her down if they don\u0027t end up attending college.“I understand some of these kids will never go to college, but I don\u0027t want them to feel like they\u0027re not successful. Whatever you choose, just be good at it,” she said. “If you\u0027re a ditch digger, be the best ditch digger there is.”\u0026nbspIn addition to reading to them once a week, she also has twice-weekly dance parties at school and does home visits to give students kudos and to help them if they are off track.“Anything I can do to build relationships,” she said. “If a child feels loved they will try. There\u0027s no science about it.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will claim their rebellion against Theresa May — a cynical, calculated risk that she is too weak to sack them — was designed to make Brexiteers realise ­voting down her deal could kill Brexit.It may have done that. But it wasn’t lost on Brussels either. And it has severely weakened our hopes of getting the one thing Brexiteers and the DUP need.Cabinet Remainers are guilty both of rank disloyalty and short-sighted stupidity.FOR a shining example of Remoaner madness, witness the negativity to Norway’s huge investment in post-Brexit Britain.Its £billion wealth fund is increasing its UK holdings because, like Qatar, it is sure we will thrive outside the EU.To ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie, though, Norway is just hoovering up our assets on the cheap due to Brexit. Yet he would have been first to blame Brexit had Norway SOLD its UK investments.Some politicians have simply abandoned reason. Their Remainia is religious.THE BBC should be allowed nowhere near its new “BritBox” service.The supposed BBC ITV rival to ­Netflix will require a reported £-a-month subscription. Yet BBC shows are funded by licence-payers. Why should we pay more to see them again ITV’s involvement is fair enough. They’re a private firm. But the BBC loves acting like one, while enjoying a £billion annual bung from TV owners extracted via threat of a criminal record.Why should it be able to deploy that monstrous public subsidy against a brilliant private innovator like Netflix If it wants to compete as a subscription service, fine. But first scrap the licence fee.WE cannot recall a more woeful set of MPs.Yet, without even a vote on it, they will trouser another inflation-beating . per cent pay rise to almost £, a year.That’s  per cent up since .

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are determined to create fairer workplaces and we recently announced the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation.“Alongside this, companies and business leaders must set an example and ensure a culture of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace comes to an end.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is thought he fled in a private plane after taking flying lessons.But now The Sun on Sunday can reveal he was granted taxpayers’ money to help fund his defence in his absence, a whopping £,. going to pay his solicitors bill and a further £,. for counsel to represent him at his trial.The case has echoes of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd. As The Sun revealed in December he got £, in taxpayer-funded legal aid despite skipping his trial and going on the run in Georgia.At the conclusion to Sovu’s trial at Blackfriars Crown Court last year Judge Rajeev Shetty said Sovu was one of the most ‘wanted men in the world’, adding: ‘He has shown breathtaking arrogance and put two fingers up to law and order.’The fraudster arrived in UK in  after completing a degree in Computer Programming and Electronics. He started a job at a software firm but was made redundant.Sovu led a gang of Romanians who built the skimmers and  ATM fronts from a shed in a back garden in Harwich Road, Colchester, Essex.The crooks used toy remote control cars to fool airport security when transporting the skimmers. By placing them inside the cars, they appeared as innocent wiring for the toys.The gang were finally stopped in  after British Transport Police officers identied suspects interfering with rail ticket machines.At Sovu’s trial prosecutors said the case involved ‘millions of pounds of fraud’ because the device ‘gives them access to your money and the banks money’.IT expert Nick Webber, who worked on the police investigation into Sovu, said: “He created thousands of these devices.“Each could hold , card details and the average bank account holds £, so he must have cost banks hundreds of millions and very likely billions of pounds.“He’s effectively the biggest bank robber in the world. He didn’t care who he sold the devices to or what they did with the money.“His skimmers went to organised crime groups and also probably funded terrorism. Card skimmers have previously been used by jihadis, people traffickers and arms dealers who supplied Middle Eastern terrorists.”Last night critics slammed the payment to Sovu - who is thought to have continued running his business in an industrial area in Shenzhen, mainland China, while living in Hong Kong.MP David Davies said: “I think I speak for all my former colleagues in the British Transport Police in saying how important it is that this man is brought to justice as quickly as possible“I am outraged that this inidual has taken £, in legal aid and has not even turned up to his own case.“He will presumably have vast assets from his criminal activities. Therefore it is vital that he is caught and stripped of his assets and his freedom as quickly as possible.”A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said: “We cannot comment on inidual cases but anyone found to have deliberately concealed or moved assets to qualy for legal aid will be ordered to pay back the money granted.“Victims are our priority and we must ensure that court cases continue to be able to proceed so that justice can be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This money, which the highly profitable tobacco industry can easily afford, could fund cash-strapped stop-smoking services and discourage young people from ever lighting up.The recommendations will also protect children by funding enforcement against underage sales and help tackle the trade in illicit cigarettes.Raising the age of sale from  to  will help stop experimentation from becoming a fatal habit and reinforce the dangers of tobacco.The next step is for the Government to show its commitment to achieving a smoke-free generation by adopting the full list of recommendations and turn them all into law."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473329623.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elon musk spacex crew dragon lands international space station","story":"It is expected to remain attached with the space station for five days before ing to Earth.The capsule is due to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean in the morning on March .The Falcon  rocket blasted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on time at .am, local time, on Saturday.The flight, which did not have a crew aboard, was a test to seeit possible to carry astronauts into space on a commercial spacecraft.Musk, , admitted to being emotionally exhausted after his SpaceX Crew Dragon rocketship blasted off.His company is working with NASA to resume sending US astronauts into space from American soil for the first time since .Speaking after the launch, Musk said the launch was super stressful to watch, but hes hopeful the capsule will be ready to carry people later this year.He said: To be frank, Im a little emotionally exhausted.We have to dock to the station.

The question itself is infuriating because what they mean is can a woman have a job, a partner and a family. Having it all seems a pretty low bar. When I was a little girl I dreamed of being a leader, an explorer, or seeing the world and feeling every emotion in bright technicolour. Having it all for a woman is essentially having exactly what men have always expected as the norm. It is pretty basic.   That said, I do recognise for women today we have better opportunities than my mum had. Generations of feminists have fought for better childcare options, equal pay and services to protect women from violence at home and work. Things are better and we should pay tribute to the trailblazing women who went before. I know that those trailblazing women, like the suffragettes, like the pilloried women of the s and the women who opened the first women’s refuges in the s would not want me to swoon with gratitude for how far we’ve come, they would want me to keep on demanding more.   Domestic and sexual violence are now far less socially acceptable than they used to be.

But there was a big catch. His future in-laws insisted that he dress as a woman for the wedding. And Roy would have to keep up the pretence for months afterwards. This was because the British Sikh fshyamily didn’t want anyone to know their son was gay. Roy was so lovestruck he accepted the conditions and moved into their house in London. But he ended up trying to kill himself after nine months of abuse including shybeing ordered to wear a wig and high heels. Roy, now , met his future shyhusband when he was  at a family wedding. He recalled: “He started singing love songs to me and told me I had a beautul smile. Later he made a move and we kissed.” The pair started dating in secret as Roy was afraid his own Sikh family would disown himthey found out.   He said: “Two years later he asked me to marry him. I thought this was my very own fairytale love story.” Days later Roy received a call from his future mother-in-law. “We met up on our own,” he explained. “It was the first time I’d met her. “She said I was very good-looking and her son had chosen well. “But she told me that she comes from a big Indian family and there’s a lot of honour involved. “She saidI wanted to marry him I would have to dress as a woman on the wedding day. I would also need to pretend to be a woman for a while to convince the community her son isn’t gay.” He added: “I was gobsmacked. I thought, ‘How did that even come into her head ’ She had even brought a basket of women’s clothes and gold bracelets with her.” After agonising over the weird shyarrangement, Roy agreed. “I knew it was going to be dficult us being together as LGBTQ isn’t talked about in the Asian community,” he said. “I hadn’t even told my own family. But I just wanted to be with him and I would have done anything.”  Roy, who comes from Manchester, told his parents he was moving to London for work. In reality, he was living with his partner in his in-laws’ house in the capital and, as the big day drew nearer, he became ever more nervous. “Me and his mum would go shopping for the shywedding and she would tell me I was going to be her best friend. “Yet she never asked what I wanted. She chose everything. I couldn’t even pick the date. She just asked for money so I sold my brand new car and gave her pound, to pay for it all.” During the wedding at the family’s house, Roy nearly fainted from fear of being found out. “She told everyone in the community I was a widow and an orphan so I had no guests. I was forced to dress as a bride because they couldn’t accept a gay wedding. “This was supposed to be the best day of my le – it was the worst day of my le. “There were  people staring at me and only nine people knew the truth. “They all kept saying, ‘She’s so shybeautul’, and, ‘Does she have any sisters for our sons ’ “I was thinking, ‘Come on, you’re shypulling my leg here’. “My heart was beating so fast. I thought they were going to find out I was a man. But no one asked any questions. Luckily I was able to wear a veil for the majority of the ceremony.”   The next day Roy was told he would be called Lucky in future – and was not allowed to be seen without high-heels, full make-up and jewellery. “My mum-in-law started calling me her daughter-in-law,” he said. “There was a time when I came down in slippers, not really dressed. She said I needed to maintain myself at all times and never come down again like that. “I was so confused as it was just me and her in the house. “I kept thinking, ‘Does she not realise I’m a man and this is fake ’” Roy said she treated him “worse than Cinderella”, making him work  hours a day doing demeaning domestic chores. He was criticised for over-salting food and claimed he was once locked in a cupboard as a punishment. She also restricted his toilet breaks so that he would often wet himself. “I needed to be up at am to cook the breakfast. I had to cook all three meals a day. But I wasn’t allowed to eat. “She would tell me I was too fat and I wouldn’t pass as a woman.”  He became malnourished on just a bowl of Weetabix and a smoothie a day. Roy sought comfort in his husband, who he still loved, but says they barely had any time together. He recalled: “He didn’t see what was going on and we argued about it shyconstantly.” Then Roy’s partner started shycalling him his we, buying him lingerie and shyexpensive jewellery. Roy’s own parents found out his secret and disowned him when snaps of the wedding appeared on Facebook , exposing Roy as the bride pictured. His mum-in-law forced him to visit them dressed as Lucky. He said: “She wanted to sit down with my family and tell them what had shyhappened. They took it really badly and told me never to come home again.” Roy finally found the courage to leave his husband and in-laws after nine months. He said: “Sometimes I would look at myself in the shymirror and think, ‘Who is this person looking back at me ’ “I wanted to rip the clothes and wig off. I was dying inside. Roy eventually left with nowhere to go and ended up in a homeless shelter. At first he was relieved to be wearing men’s clothes again. But he added: “I felt out of place when I stopped dressing as a woman. I didn’t know who I was any more.” Four months later he tried to kill shyhimself after he found out his husband was set to marry a woman.  He said: “We would still have shyconversations on the phone and I would cry for him. But he told me he had to marry someone  – and he did it while he was still married to me. “Mine was a big lavish love story and it had turned into a nightmare. “I put my wedding outfit back on and I went down to the river and slashed my wrists. I felt like they made me his we so I was going to kill the we. I wanted to die in that way so they would have seen me die as his we.” A passer-by dragged Roy from the water and he was taken to a hospital, who called his parents. “They took me back home,” he said. “No matter what, when a parent sees a child in that state it makes them see they have to stand by you.” Now Roy performs in drag as ‘Miss Lucky’ in a bid to reclaim his identity. He said: “I wanted to take ownership of what happened. This is my way of shydoing that.” But the scars remain. He said: “I still can’t sleep. Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night and see her face. I shout ‘I’m not a woman.’ I never want this to happen to anyone .” Roy’s ex, who has not been named, said: “Me and my mum would like to apologise to Roy Lucky Singh.” "},{"url":null,"title":"puppy who helped brave owner","story":"NewsPuppy who helped brave owner recover after brain surgery to compete at CruftsEXCLUSIVE: Ella Gibbs begged for a white puppy just moments after waking from her op, six years ago - and was given Lulu by her mumShareCommentsByJessica Cripps:,  MAR NewsElla Gibbs and Lulu will be taking part in their first ever Crufts competition this year \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs brave Ella Gibbs faced shyemergency brain surgery she begged her mum Louise for a puppy – a little white one. Of course Louise said yes to her shydaughter, who was ten. Doctors said her mum could promise the child anything to keep her calm shybecause she won’t remember it after the shygruelling -hour operation. But the first thing Ella said when she came round was: “Mum, Dad, where’s my white puppy.” So Louise, , honoured her promise. Since then Ella and her shih-poo Lulu have formed such a tight bond that they are competing at Crufts this week. Even before they met, the puppy was helping Ella in hospital after surgery on a brain tumour following a seizure. Choosing her future pet’s name and planning for its arrival helped Ella cope with her shyintense month-long recovery.   Nine days after ing home to Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, eight-week-old Lulu arrived. And the pair became the best of pals. Six years on, Ella and Lulu compete in agility trials and have qualied for their first Crufts competition. Louise recalled: “The surgical team said, ‘Keep her calm, you can promise shyher anything. She won’t remember shybecause we’ve given her stuff to help her through surgery.’ “We thought we would hear no more of it.” But Louise said afterwards Ella was shystruggling to string words together but laid there and asked her parents: “Where’s my white puppy ” Friends thought they were mad to grant Ella’s request so quickly but Louise has no regrets.  Louise said: “The first time Ella saw Lulu it was definitely meant to be. “I thought I can’t believe we’re recovering from this and shyintroducing a puppy into the house. “But it was the best thing we did shybecause Lulu just shybecame the focus of everything. “She would never be naughty or lick wounds – all the things that a puppy would normally do, Lulu didn’t. The puppy was part of Ella from the word go and even went with her when she shyed to school.” The family first tried out an agility trial session for dogs at a fair. It went well so Louise booked them in for a lesson, then more lessons. In only a year, Ella and her pet became competition ready. Ella lost her peripheral vision after the seizure but Lulu was in absolute sync with the teenager. Lulu, it seems, shyinstinctively adapted to stay in Ella’s sight, something her mum cannot explain. Ella, , said: “Lulu is definitely my best friend. It’s our first ever Crufts.”   She has no expectations of shysuccess but counts it as a victory that they are even competing in the world’s shypremier dog show – at Birmingham’s NEC from Thursday to next Sunday. She said: “We’re so excited. I feel like I need to try and get Lulu to do well. She’s a pretty little white fluffy dog but has the attitude of a St Bernard. She rules the roost.” Ella said her lack of peripheral vision is challenging, similar to a horse shywearing shyblinkers. In sports such as hockey she tends to run into people. Ella admitted: “I’m quite shyclumsy so I will walk into stuff or knock stuff over and I’ve just learned how to cope with that. “But Lulu is really good. I think she knows I have no peripheral vision shybecause she will always be on my leftshe’s running or she’ll get out of my way. “Lulu will always be calm and in the right place doing the right thing. “With Lulu it’s just natural.

A victim of the vile crime herself she launched an  month campaign to see it enshrined in law. Here, she tells about her own terrying experience. It was a boiling day in Summer  and I was at a festival with my sister, waiting to see The Killers. There was a group of blokes behind us, who kept trying to chat us up. We told them we just wanted to watch the music, but they kept pestering us. I felt someone jostle me, but, in the middle of a crowd of , people, I thought little of it. But when I glanced round, I saw the blokes all laughing at their phones. On the screen, there was a picture of my crotch – one of them had stuck his hand up my skirt, taken a photo, and sent it to his mates.   It was utterly humiliating and completely violating. I yelled at the top of my voice about what they’d done, and a woman nearby managed to snatch one of their phones and give it to me. Immediately, I raced through the thick crowd, trying to make it to the security guards. When the guards saw me running, with a huge man chasing me, they surrounded me and told the man to back off. The police were called, but I was astonished when they told me that upskirting wasn’t a crime. Three days later, they closed the case. Desperate that those awful men wouldn’t get away with it, I posted a picture to Facebook – a selfie my sister and I took moments before the attack in which two of the blokes were visible, with a caption explaining what they’d done.  The picture was shared thousands of times and I was inundated with support – until Facebook told me to take it down because it was ‘harassment’. So I started an online petition to make upskirting illegal. I got , signatures and a law firm offered to help me, pro bono. Eighteen months later, I watched the law being changed at the House Of Lords, tears streaming down my face. People who take violating pictures up skirts can now be sent to prison for up to two years. It didn’t sink in until I got to the pub with my family and had a glass of wine. I cried for hours. There had been plenty of times when I’d thought there was no way the law would ever change, it just felt like the ultimate David and Goliath. I thought politics was impenetrable, but I managed to have an influence on it. I’m just an ordinary working class girl from the North – I didn’t think someone like me could change the law. ButI can do it, anyone can. Gina has written a book about her experiences changing the law. Be the Change will be realised in June, pound., published by Sphere.

And although Sharon, , was at first sceptical that this could be the real Kenny Johnson, star of US hit shows S.W.A.T, Dexter and Sons of Anarchy, she gradually allowed herself to believe it. But ‘Kenny’ was in fact a sick conman posing as the actor online. And the smoothtalking crook was about to swindle vulnerable, orced mum-of-two Sharon out of pound,. When he gave her a sob story saying he needed money to replace a damaged movie camera, the smitten pound-a-week payroll clerk fell for it.   She took out a pound, bank loan, borrowed pound, from her -year-old uncle and added another pound, on a credit card. All the time he wooed her with sweet talk and tales of his glamorous le.The penny only dropped when ANOTHER Kenny conman contacted her on Facebook .“I feel a fool for falling for such a scam,” says Sharon.   “This guy flattered me and I believed he was Kenny. He was so convincing. “He kept saying he loved me — and like an idiot I believed him.” She was targeted by the crook after she started following the real Kenny, , on his official Instagram account, thekennethjohnson, which has , followers. In November, Sharon received a personal message from a similar account, saying: “Thank you for all your love and supports.” The gran noticed that the account ‘thekenny_johnson’ had only  followers and at first ignored the message, thinking it could not be the Hollywood hunk who most recently starred as in US cop show S.W.A.T.   But three days later another message from the account popped up asking: “Have you been watching Swat ” Sharon, yearning for love after not having a proper relationship for  years, took the fateful decision to reply: “Yes.” “We started talking, but I thought it couldn’t really be him,” says the mum who has two daughters,  and .“He told me I was an amazing fan. Then he gave me an email address so we could talk on Google Hangouts.”She asked him for a selfie to prove he was the real deal. Then he suggested a video call that totally hooked her. “I saw a video of Kenny on his bed. His mouth was moving, but there was no sound. It convinced me he was genuine.”  She now believes the fraudster had downloaded a film of the married star and muted it. “I thought ‘why is he interested in a orced granny from Ipswich ’ “But I told him I was there for him and started to call him ‘baby’. “We swapped pictures. He called me ‘honey’ and said I was beautul. “I told him, ‘I have not even met you and I love you’.” The crook said he had orphanages in the US, Turkey and Africa. Sharon offered to donate and sent pound by Western Union to dferent accounts, one in Nigeria. Then he told her of a film he was financing, The Desperate Adventure. One day he told her a movie vehicle had crashed and he needed , — pound, — towards a replacement camera from Turkey.  Sharon, who lives with her -year-old dad, got a pound, car loan from the Halax. Then she borrowed pound, from her -year-old uncle, telling him it was a start-up loan for her to work in the film world, and she sent the money to the Turkish account on January , believing ‘Kenny’s’ promise to pay her back. The fraudster then said his Turkish supplier needed more for shipping. Sharon took pound, from her credit card and transferred it last Tuesday. She says: “My oldest daughter had said, ‘Don’t do it” and my youngest one said it was a scam – but I had already sent the money.” Next day came her “lightbulb moment” — an unsolicited Facebook message from yet another ‘Kenny Johnson’. Sharon says: “I realised I was being targeted in exactly the same way.” She got back in touch with her scammer. Still calling her “honey”, he promised to pay the loans back. Devastated Sharon has reported the crime to police, but doubts she’ll ever see the cash again. “I feel terrible as I’ve let down myself and my family,” she says. “Now I want to warn other women about the fraudsters out there.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle faces plot buckingham","story":"NewsMeghan Markle faces plot from Buckingham Palaces men in grey says royal writerRoyal biographer Anna Pasternak claims these men in grey are plotting the Duchess of Sussexs downfallShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsMeghan Markles is being targeted by Buckingham Palaces men in grey says a royal biographer \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle is facing a plot from Buckingham Palaces so-called men in grey who are planning her downfall, claims a royal writer. Anna Pasternak, a royal biographer, claims members of the royal court want to remove the Duchess of Sussex as a threat to the throne. The writer, whose book about Wallis Simpson is due to be released, says pregnant Meghan has rejuvenated the spirit of the American orcee who rocked the monarchy. Wallis relationship with then then King Edward VIII caused a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication, changing the course of the royal family forever. The couple married in  and the Queens father went on to become King in his place.   Speaking to S Magazine in the Sunday Express, Ms Pasternak said: Meghan is like a grenade thats been thrown into this archaic system and there are explosions already going on which I think will continue. In a sense Meghan has rejuvenated the spirit of Wallis and I hope people take the view of her as a kind, witty, loyal and dignied person who unfairly became the most vilied woman in the world. These men in grey were previously mentioned by Princess Diana during her marriage to Prince Charles. Ms Paternack added: I worry for Meghan and Harry. Hes the peoples prince as Edward was the peoples king.   I fearMeghan and Harrys star rises too high that will be perceived as the courtiers Princess Diana called men in grey as a threat to the heir.

Louella, , died after Broughton failed to get help for her when she had a bad reaction to a party drug he gave her at a festival — and callously recorded her drawn-out death on his mobile while laughing. Ex-girlfriend Paulina Aberg, , came forward as his trial started, claiming he did the same to her. Speaking from Stockholm, Sweden, Paulina’s mum Maria, , said: “As soon as she saw what happened to Louella she was determined to help.   “She wanted to show Louella’s family that she stands by them. It was a tough decision but she’s an amazing girl to have done it.” Broughton, , got eight-and-a-half years for manslaughter. He gave yoga teacher Louella Class A hallucinogen C-P at Bestival in Dorset in  — then filmed her while laughing and giving “shout-outs” to his rap group. On Thursday, he was found guilty of “shocking and despicable negligence” in failing to get help. It was then revealed he had a track record of giving women large drugs doses and filming the results — as well as a “morbid” interest in images of death. Paulina flew from Sweden to be interviewed after coming forward to court officials and prosecutor William Mousley QC. She told police that just a month before Louella’s death, Broughton had given her drugs and then filmed her suffering.   Paulina, who met Broughton while working at a London fashion store, claimed “it affected her badly and she fell”. She said her head smashed into a sink, knocking her out cold. Paulina claimed Broughton then took a picture of her unconscious, which he later sent to her, and left her to call an ambulance herself. The prosecution argued the evidence showed a pattern of the rapper intoxicating women and recording the consequences for his own warped pleasure.

Last year the -year-old was the first foreigner in the Carnival’s  year history to lead the procession as the ‘muse abre alas’ - lead dancer - for her samba school at the world-famous carnival. Today she reveals she is four-months pregnant with a baby boy and is going to lead the carnival for the second time for her samba school, with her bump in tow.   “My first question to the doctor was ‘Can I still do the parade ’” said Sam, originally from Kentish Town in London. She said: “The doctor gave me the green light so I was very happy. I have to be a little bit calmer than I would normally, not samba’ing like a complete maniac.” Sam says the baby’s dad Rodrigo de Souza Lim, a jujitsu fighter, is ecstatic that he’s going to be a father.   The -year-old Londoner previously said she was thrilled to be leading the biggest carnival in the world - where more than m people attend. Samantha moved to Rio in  after giving up her job as a PR exec, leaving behind her Jewish family, after a trip to the country. She told The Times: “It was literally love at first sight. Within six months I had quit my job and moved here. “I do sometimes think ‘what’s a nice Jewish girl who used to just love a dance, nothing more, doing here ” It’s a privilege and a responsibility . Samantha has no professional dance experience and was only at her first carnival in , when she dressed as a canary.

We’ve seen heroin, cocaine, cannabis and ketamine shydestroying lives, leaving scars. But the latest addiction quietly taking hold is dferent. Because it’s one that doctors are shyfeeding. And while everyone has been busy panicking about GPs shyoverprescribing antibiotics, no one has noticed how painkillers — opioids — are being churned out. I have taken painkillers for things like period pain and, more recently, muscle pain for Dancing on Ice. I do believe that sometimes you have to work through the pain for the body to heal properly. But when it affects quality of le, then we do need to turn to GPs. And to trust they know what is best for us.   This week on Loose Women, Janet Street-Porter opened up about being prescribed painkillers after a knee operation. She was given  dihydrocodeine tablets and could take up to eight a day. Plus she had the antidepressant amitriptyline, which gave her “dreadful anxiety dreams”. She said: “All this medication was meant to make me feel better but actually I felt tearful and stoned.” It took her weeks to scale it down.   An older relative of mine has arthritis and is in constant pain. I’d never taken much notice of what she was being prescribed, but I had noticed her never-ending trips to her GP and chemist for tablets. I always thought the doctor knew best and never shyquestioned it or asked how she felt. I now fear she could be well on her way to being addicted to painkillers. The US has been battling an opioid epidemic since the s. Last year, the city of Los Angeles even filed a lawsuit against shypharmaceutical firms for deceptive marketing and sale, accusing them of exaggerating the benefits of opioids and downplaying risks. We need to wake up to the fact that the problem is getting a grip here and devastating lives. Anyone on your street could be an addict. You don’t need to hang around dodgy bars or surf the dark net to get a fix. You just pop your repeat prescription in. Opioids have two effects — they relieve pain and make you euphoric. So you feel like you’re safe and on a fluffy cloud.   The trend for prescribing them is on the rise, especially in deprived areas. The number of deaths linked to one called fentanyl shot up by almost a third in the UK in a year. Fentanyl can be up to  times stronger than heroin. With an ageing population, and aches and pains getting worse, we could end up with a generation of shygeriatric junkies. But anyone can get hooked. Celebs including Prince, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger and Brittany Murphy died after being addicted to painkillers. Le can be painful and tough — and who wouldn’t want to make it better by popping a pill  Our GPs are trained to make patients feel better as quickly as possible, so in the time and system they operate in, painkillers are the easiest answer. But some studies even show that for long-term back pain, these drugs are no better than a placebo. So as painful as it might be, we need to deal with this problem now. And tell GPs to rein it in.

Self-defence training shows a postie dropping to one knee to protect herself and using her postbag as a shield. The move comes after a string of shyhorric attacks in which rogue pets have bitten off fingers, thumbs and even a nose. The new “dog byte” computer program urges posties to look for signs that a pet is present and not to take at face value assurances that an animal is harmless. It also asks users what advice they would give to a new postman. If they make the wrong choice the rookie is bitten. Royal Mail has tried the system nearly  times since November. No attacks have occurred in more than half the areas where the units have been tested.   James Barton, Royal Mail’s online learning manager, said: “Over the years, we’ve tried to do lots of things about this. “We’ve done big public awareness campaigns.

The breadth of measures the new policy ensures are considered first – from redeployment and reskilling to early retirement and voluntary redundancy – underlines the council’s commitment to avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible and to promoting additional job options and prospects for any staff displaced by change in the way we provide services in the future.“The policy and resources committee also agreed changes to the flexible retirement scheme and salary conservation. Employees already on these schemes will not be affected. All of this was subject to discussion with the trades unions before a report was taken to committee.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever

This is a top fixture in this country and there is no love lost between the supporters.“But once the game starts the players are expected to play the game in a certain way, there is that demand of them.“There has to be the professional side of it and handling the game. Being smart, composed and calm at the right time.“We are quite a young team but there is enough experience with players who have played in cup finals, European games and big league-defining games in terms of positions.“We can harness all that experience we have.“Although there are some youngsters in the team who are still learning that side of it I have no doubt they will be able to deal with the game.”The temperament of Morelos is flammable but there is no disputing his quality – the Colombian is on  goals this season.A player who operates on the edge, Morelos has hit seven goals in the last three games. How Morelos performs, and whether he remains on the pitch, will be crucial to Rangers’ hopes.McInnes said: “Morelos is a good player who is capable of being the dference in a tight game. He is someone who has had a fantastic season and one of many good players Rangers have.“If we can limit Morelos’ contribution it goes a long way to getting the result we want.”The form of both sides ahead of today#s quarter-final could not be more conflicting.Aberdeen have suddenly developed a concerning dose of home sickness with just one win in seven games at Pittodrie, a - defeat of Championship Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup.At home the Dons have taken just two points from the last possible . In back-to-back home games against relegation-battling sides they have taken one point.McInnes said: “We have played Rangers at dferent stages this season when they have been in good form.“With the players they have it is no real surprise they are in good form at the moment.“They are certainly finding their way to goal showing their attacking threat.“Rangers have some fantastic players, you cannot deny that.“Andgiven space and time to enjoy the game they can hurt you.“We are well aware of that and of the need for concentration and defending properly.“The aggression in the game has got to be there and whenever we have beaten Rangers this season there has been good concentration and everyone playing their part.“We will need that again.”Aberdeen hold the upper hand in the head-to-heads with Rangers so far this season.A goal from Lewis Ferguson dumped the Ibrox club - in the Betfred Cup semi-final at Hampden in October.Then Scott McKenna netted in a - triumph at Ibrox in the first of Aberdeen’s club record-equalling seven straight away wins.Steven Gerrard’s Rangers, rebuilt with a £ million-plus investment this season, secured their first victory when winning - at Pittodrie last month.It is understood Rangers’ over-exuberant celebrations in the away dressing room following that game caused some consternation with the Dons.McInnes said: “Any team can celebrate any time they want when they win. That is not important.”Aberdeen were booed off the pitch at full-time by frustrated sections of the Red Army following the dismal loss to Hamilton.McInnes understands the frustration at the home form but is confident Aberdeen supporters will be fully behind their side in a game with so much signicance to the season.He has called for them to be patient as Rangers could have extended spells of possession.He said: “No supporters like seeing a team coming up and having loads of the ball.“Rangers are a team who are possession-based and like to have enough of the ball.“It is important that in those moments the supporters stay with the team.“We have enough about us as a team that we know our capabilities and can go and cause them problems.“We have scored in every game against them this season. And we are confident we have the players who can do that again.“Obviously we want to score one more goal than them to get into a semi-final.“One might be enough – who knows “It will be a tough task to stop this Rangers team from scoring.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14079781.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_college.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

Last February former Ayr Renaissance boss David Bell said: David Bell said: “Work is scheduled to be complete in late spring this year, when we’ll open the ground floor as a market square to help create a busy new attraction for Ayr town centre.” But the finished article has never materialised. The ill-fated Renaissance team bought the building in March  with a view to breathing new le into the bottom end of the town. The site is where farmers sold their corn to merchants from the s to . And the vision for a new market was formulated to hark back to Ayr’s glorious status as county town. A council spokesman admitted: “There have been signicant delays to this project. However, we are committed to opening the market and events space as quickly as possible for the people of Ayr and beyond. “We have a short specialist fit-out contract to complete, which should be ready for the start of May so that the building can be used for markets and events from the summer.” Ayr councillor Martin Dowey said: “It has been one sorry excuse after another with this building and frankly the people of Ayr and beyond deserve far better.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"sleazy oap 72 who took","story":"NewsSleazy OAP, , who took pics of Ayr schoolgirls in mini-skirts told youre guilty all day longRetired architect Ross McKay was told by a sherf he \"should be able to control\" himself at his age.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsRoss Mackay was placed on the sex offenders register \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner who took pictures of schoolgirls in mini skirts will be on the sex offenders’ register for the next three years, writes Edwin Lawrence. Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March . Sherf Montgomery told McKay at the trial: “There is overwhelming evidence it was you in your car. “You’re guilty all day long.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSex crimeAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14066677.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elr_ayp_260613babs.jpg","title":"tributes paid mr gaiety ayr","story":"NewsTributes paid to Mr Gaiety as Ayr theatre legend Bernard Cotton diesBernard Cotton was a do-it-all theatre manager in the Gaietys pomp and booked acts like Billy Connolly, Ken Dodd and Barbara Windsor.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsBernard outside his beloved Gaiety \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man who was ‘Mr Gaiety’ in Ayr for nearly two decades has died suddenly, aged , writes Edwin Lawrence. Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

No concrete dates have been set as the event is still being finalised. However, local people and businesses are encouraged to get involved to help promote Hoggrsquos Borders legacy.Internationally, the anniversary will be celebrated in Washington DC.Enthusiasts can attend an event held in the Library of Congress where they will be talking about Hoggrsquos le and Borderrsquos traditions.Stirling University is known as the world centre of Hoggs work.And they are currently doing a project to collect all the poets work and republish it. So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to

One of the ways is by going into local businesses to encourage them to cut down on what they use.ldquoAn idea we have also had is introducing a pint deposit scheme, similar to the one which is in place at Murrayfield.ldquoThat is something we could look at bringing to Melrose at events such as the Rugby Sevens to cut down on single use plastic.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"dalintobers dazzling daffodils","story":"Since October, come rain or shine, they have been making forays into Craigowan Woods for a morning lesson outdoors.

Activities will be relocated where in Musselburgh.A spokesman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe building on Bridge Street, which currently houses the cafeacute, is used for a small number of hours each week. The initiative was launched in  when internet access was less readily available at home, school or in other settings.ldquoIn recent years, visits to the building have tended to be for generic youth activities. There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources. This will allow us to make increasingly effective use of assets in a challenging financial climate.Turning to the MECLC, he stressed that the centre, a council building managed on its behalf by FES, would not close and there would be no displacement of current activities. It was, he added, about ldquomaximising use of the building in the delivery of services.The spokesman explained: ldquoIt is proposed that a small number of CLD staff who currently work out of office facilities within the Musselburgh East Community Learning Centre, relocate to office facilities at an alternative location. These staff are not involved with the day-to-day running of the building or the activities which take place there, as it is managed by FES under a separate contract. This arrangement continues.ldquoWe are always keen to maximise the use of community buildings and are exploring whether it might be possible to establish additional provision within the building in the future. This will be discussed in detail with the management committee and stakeholders in due course. The proposal relates to year two of the budget ndash  .Councillor Andy Forrest, Labour, a ward member and Depute Provost of East Lothian, said: ldquoWith the current restraints on council budgets due to cuts in funding from the Scottish Government, moving the Inter.Esk Cafeacute to a new venue where it will not be a stand-alone facility will enable staff to promote digital inclusion to a wider number of people and therefore service a wider range of the community.He added: ldquoWith regard to MECLC, this facility has been on the rise since it was opened. Relocation of staff will not have any effect on activities that are run from or at the centre. The management group will continue to work with and support East Lothian staff with projects and activities.Councillor Stuart Currie, a Musselburgh member and leader of the SNP Group, said: ldquoThe whole point of the Inter.Esk Cafe was to provide facilities for young people in a safe place. We donrsquot have a community centre in Musselburgh. We have got the Brunton Hall but not a drop-in community centre.He added that there had been no discussions about the proposal with the Musselburgh Common Good Committee which he chaired although the building was in the Common Good portfolio. He added that Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council or the wider community had not been consulted.He described the decision to relocate CLD staff as a ldquocash grab.Mr Currie said: ldquoMy concern is that the centre was built in the heart of the community and the whole point of having people working for the council is that they should be based in the community. It is a cost-saving exercise, not about improving things.

Relocating the CLD staff from MECLC allows other options for this building to be considered including use by East Lothian Council departments or sub-let to a third sector organisation.Councillor John Williamson, SNP, commented on the closure of the Inter.Esk Cafe, saying: ldquoFor the sake of pound, a year the Inter.Esk Cafe is going to close following decisions made by Labour and Conservative councillors at the East Lothian Council budget meeting on Tuesday. The cafeacute provides a safe place for young people aged - to meet, have access to computers, make friends and get support for any issues they are having to deal with.ldquoIt is centrally located in Musselburgh and on a main bus route so is easily accessible to users.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story. Go find the Kingrsquos Chair for yourself and see what your imagination comes up with!"},{"url":null,"title":"double-cash-boost-for-our-community-kitchen-project-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen has been awarded more than pound,, which it will use over the next year.The bulk of the money has come from Big Lottery Scotland, with pound, awarded to see the group expand to three days a week from next month.Already, the project meets on a Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club.In the coming weeks, it will also meet on a Wednesday and Thursday, hosting dozens of people at each session and serving a hearty three-course meal for a donation of pound.Elaine Gale, spokeswoman for the project, felt Our Community Kitchen was well on the road to being a success.She said: ldquoIt is so exciting for the area and just to see where we go next.

SNP depute leader Keith Brown will put forward a motion to the partyrsquos conference next month to adopt as the official party line that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency.The plan envisages Scotland using the pound during a transition period following a vote to leave the UK, aiming for the Scottish Parliament deciding on establishing the new currency by the end of its first term in an independent Scotland.In the run-up to the  referendum, then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a UK-wide currency union ndash a proposition rejected by parties opposing independence.Mr Mackay was questioned on advice from economist Andrew Wilson who predicted a GDP deficit of around % following independence and suggested this should be halved over five to  years before any independent Scottish currency was introduced.The forecast was made in a May  report by the Growth Commission, set up by Scotlandrsquos First Minister to draw up a new economic blueprint for independence following the  referendum.Mr Mackay said the deficit could be reduced more quickly than forecast, but denied such a move would accelerate austerity.ldquoWe could reduce that notional deficit, of course thatrsquos the deficit for being part of the United Kingdom, and accelerate the economic growth, he told the

Julia SutherlandJulia Sutherland is a stand-up because she was forced to be. A former on-air sidekick to Fred MacAulay on his radio show, she was entered in a stand-up competition as a stunt for the show and ended up having to do five minutes of material. People laughed.

Arnold BrownIf stand-ups comedians were compiling this list, then therersquos every chance that Arnold Brown would be in the top ten such is his status among people who try to make other people laugh. Why did the Glaswegian not become a bigger star  Perhaps itrsquos because his slow style seemed too slow for television, but Brown was always best on a small stage: he built his reputation in smoky rooms and then, after the smoking ban, in non-smoky rooms and thatrsquos where hersquos continued to this day. If you donrsquot like alternative comedy, then Arnold Brown is one of the men you should blame.

Stirlingrsquos crazed, pantomimic, querulous voiceover has been the best thing about Love Island. His voice and face are now wanted all over.. Hersquos even a go-to for advice on the Millennial condition, which he doles out in his book Not Ready To Adult Yet: A Totally Ill-informed Guide To Le. Karen DunbarDunbar was a national treasure in the making right from when she arrived, nostrils-flaring, on our televisions in Chewin The Fat, delivering us classics like Fiona the lonely shopkeeper. Since then shersquos done just about everything from panto and stand-up, to Calendar Girls: The Musical, and a TED talk about comedy. Plus, hers was the voice that delivered the Commonwealth Games to the world, saying, ldquoThis is our house and youre all very welcome. Harry LauderWhen Harry Lauder met Charlie Chaplin in  it was one huge world star meeting another. Itrsquos sometimes forgotten that: just how big a star of music hall and comedy Harry Lauder was. Like Chaplin, Lauder passed the biggest test of comedy and entertainment there ever was: a loud, drunken audience in a music hall. Hersquod also entertained his fellow miners when he worked down the pits and his great skill was the comic song touched with pathos. He knew how to make people laugh but he knew how to cry as well: his son was killed on the Western Front during the First World War. Ken BruceYes, him off the radio. The trained chartered accountant from Glasgow is not, it is fair to say, a well kent face on the stand-up circuit, but his gently humorous, easy-osey manner on Radio  every morning makes everything all right with the world for millions.

Una McLeanScottish acting royalty McLean, from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire, can turn her hand to comedy sketch shows, panto, serious theatre and film. She is currently appearing in BBC Scotland drama series River City. Her career began at the Byre Theatre in St Andrews in  and in , she starred in Scotlands first one-woman television show, Did You See Una  Chic MurrayThe Godfather of surrealist comedy  Probably.

Then try to lose yourself.\" They driest delivery this side of Gobi desert milk run also helped him sell surreal jokes such as \"I drew a gun. He drew a gun. I drew another gun. Soon we were surrounded by lovely drawings of guns.\" Most modern comedians worship at the altar of Murrays memory. Sanjeev KohliFor years Kohli, who as a youngster worked in his familyrsquos convenience stores, was the comic king of the cornershop, delivering us laugh after belly-laugh from behind a counter, as Navid Harrid, the grey-bearded shop-owner in Still Game, or as Ramesh Manju in award-winning, cult radio comedy Fags, Mags  Bags. Now a regular on River City, hersquos left the shop behind, playing banker-turned-baker AJ, and recently appeared in the biopic Stan And Ollie. Ivor CutlerIt was George Melly who maybe summed up the late Ivor Cutler best: ldquoVery funny in a sinister sort of way. The Scottish poet, songwriter and humourist grew up in a Jewish family in Govan, appeared in The Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour and was a favourite of John Peelrsquos. Proof that England doesnrsquot have a monopoly on eccentricity. Jerry SadowitzFew comedians dare take their stand-up to the places Sadowitz has been known to go, probably for good reason. The humour is as black as the trademark top hat, the material wince-inducingly controversial and the live shows chaotic and aggressive, meaning TV appearances have been rare . Despite this, the Glaswegian remains one of the most influential ndash and isive ndash stand-ups of the last  years. Bruce MortonBruce Morton did the best comedy show ever. March  at the MacBob in Stirling when he was touring Blood Below the Window, his autobiographical one-man show, which was hilar , but had a sucker punch of hurt at the heart of it. Apart from his dalliance with Channel  , Morton has always been too marginal a figure for his talent. But no one is better at hearing the comic music of the Scots tongue. Dorothy PaulThe undisputed Queen of Scottish comedy, the Dennistoun woman is as funny as she is loved by Glaswegians who love to be taken down memory lane to a world of jeely pieces and fumbles and the dancin. Paul convinced as an excellent actress in the likes of The Steamie, and more recently Still Game, but it was her live touring shows that revealed her glorious skills of holding an audience in the palm of her hand. Robert Florence and Iain ConnellThe duo behind sketch show Burnistoun brought us characters such as Jolly Boy John, Biscuity Boyle and Quality Polis, as well as co-writing the sitcom Legit which starred Clare Grogan, Jordan Young and Raymond Mearns.

Whats not to like about a former journalist and stripper whos dryer than the inside of a sand lizardrsquos top lip and more blunt than the new Mary Poppins. Janet BrownThe Rutherglen-born actor and impressionist will always be best-known for her memorable impersonation of Margaret Thatcher at the height of her pomp, which cropped up throughout the s and s everywhere from Mike Yarwoodrsquos popular Saturday night show to Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Gerard KellyKelly, from Glasgow, was a panto favourite in the city and a talented serious actor, but his big break was as hapless bank worker and would-be author Willie Melvin in the BBC Scotland comedy City Lights. He was the lynchpin of a stellar cast . He died in  following a brain aneurysm. Jane McCarryShe steals the show as loveable busybody Isa Drennan on Still Game. As the hit BBC Scotland comedy bows out later this month, who wouldnrsquot love to see Isa and shopkeeper Navidget their own spin-off series  The campaign starts here. Robbie ColtraneColtranemade his name in the alternative comedy movement of the s before becoming a household name. He was brilliant as a criminal psychologist in Cracker he appeared in two Bond movies he was an outsize presence as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films. In the  C series National Treasure he was outstanding as Paul Finchley, an ageing comedian suddenly beset with allegations of historical rape and sexual assault. Richard WilsonIf you ever see Richard Wilson in the street, do not shout his catchphrase at him. In fact, donrsquot even think about the catchphrase. Yoursquore thinking about it now arenrsquot you  The thing is, Wilson was, and is, much more than catchphrase comedy. He once said that there was some of his dad in Victor Meldrew, star of One Foot in the Grave, and some of the writer David Renwick too, but the point is that, as he shakes his fist at idiocy, there is some of all of us in him. Arabella WeirShe coined the catchphrase \"Does my bum look big in this \" for The Fast Show, lit up our screens as long-suffering neighbour Beth in Two Doors Down and most recently had a star turn on comedy drama Pure as a mother whose OCD-suffering daughter is plagued by sexually explicit thoughts. Janey Godley and Ashley StorrieFrom Godleyrsquos ldquoTrump is a c*** sign held aloft as the US president visited his Ayrshire golf resort in  to Storriersquos hilarious parodies of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Handmaidrsquos Tale becoming viral hits, this mother and daughter are fearlessly chipping away at comedyrsquos glass ceiling.

McHugh also starred in Channel rsquos Fresh Meat, written by Peep Show creators Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. He has since moved on to straighter roles ndash hersquos currently in Channel  spy drama Traitors and Skyrsquos A Discovery Of Witches ndash but donrsquot think wersquove seen the last of Corporal McLintoch. Alan Cumming and Forbes MassonDrama school pals Cumming, from Aberfeldy, and Masson, from Falkirk, performed as musical double act and Kelvinside men Victor and Barry throughout the s and s, before finding success separately on stage and screen here and in the US. They briefly reunited in similar guise for the sarcastic, surreal cabin crew comedy The High Le alongside Siobhan Redmond. Stanley BaxterStanley Baxter once cleared the streets with his television specials that attracted m but the Glaswegian suffered all his le from anxiety and a need to be in control. As a result, Stanley, who lives in North London, offered up product sparingly, the world having the opportunity to see his Dietrich or his Coward only episodically. What he has created however is an incredible Bafta-winning legacy. LimmyIf you like your comedy surreal with a good dash of daft, Glaswegian Brian Limond has been the go-to purveyor for more than a decade. Arguably the first true UK comedian of the internet age, Limmy grew a loyal local online audience with his strangely loveable band of characters ndash who could forget former heroin addict Jacqueline McCafferty or frustrated adventure gameshow host Falconhoof  ndash but has found national recognition thanks to TV, live shows and two books.Limmy, Surprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny, Oran Mor, March , ,  and  Alastair SimYou have to be very serious to be good at comedy and Alastair Sim was very serious, particularly about his stage career. But itrsquos the films we love. Like A Christmas Carol. Is Simrsquos the greatest Scrooge  Probably. Or Laughter in Paradise in which hersquos a good man forced to go bad to inherit some moneyAnd The Belles of St Trinians of course in which he plays the headmistress Millicent Fritton. British comedy finds pretty much nothing funnier than a man in a dress but Alastair Sim did it best. Gregor Sharp and Simon CarlyleThe creators and writing partnership behind Two Doors Down which is hands-down one the funniest comedies to grace our TV screens in recent years with echoes of sitcom greats ndash from Abigails Party to The Royle Family ndash in its winning formula. More please. Gregor FisherThe ragtag Govan philosopher Rab C. Nesbitt was, as Fisher once noted, \"somebody who was forgotten, somebody from the so-called underbelly of society.\" Indeed he was, but Nesbitt managed to be one of the funniest comedy characters to emerge from Scotland, and one of the most poignant, too. He made us laugh but the laughs were sometimes uncomfortable ndash there were lots of acute social truths in them. Daniel SlossNetflix-approved and still not , Sloss has the armour-plated arrogance of youth. Sometimes that can come across as simply arrogance. But, as his latest show X, which tackles toxic masculinity, proves, he is ambitious for his comedy. He also has the stagecraft. In other words, hersquos good now, but how good is he going to be  years from now  Michelle GomezFrom unhinged staff liaison officer Sue White in Green Wing to murderous Missy in Doctor Who, Gomez brilliantly nails weirdly offbeat, deeply funny characters. The Glaswegian, also known for comic turns in The Book Group and Bad Education is currently appearing in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The KrankiesThe Krankies in the top  best Scottish comedians of all time  Are we mad-dabi-dozi  Not really: remember that Janette and Ian Tough were masters of three neglected areas of comedy: the club circuit, which is where they first made their mark in the s comedy for children on Crackerjack and the likeand pantomime, which the Krankies have dominated in Scotland for years. And no, wersquore not defending the single they released. It was not fan-dabi-dozi. No-one danced all night. And it was not all right. Rory BremnerHeonce fooled Margaret Beckett, then a minister in a Labour cabinet minister, into thinking she was talking on the phone to the Chancellor Gordon Brown. She wasnt, of course: it was the mischievous Bremner, who had Browns distinctive burr down to a T. The spoof was a reminder of his formidable impersonation skills and his gt for political satire. The hit Channel  show, Bremner, Bird and Fortune, is much missed. Rikki FultonNotmany comedians can make us laugh merely by saying lsquohellorsquo. Watch, on YouTube, any of Rikki Fultonrsquos turns as Rev I.M. Jolly on the Hogmanay Scotch and Wry shows, and you see just that: the lights going up, and Rikki, with an almost audible sigh, uttering that ineffably melancholy lsquohellorsquo. Fulton had been one-half of Francie and Josie, had starred in iety and panto, and was a serious actor, too. The Rev I.M. Jolly became a Hogmanay must-see for many Scots. Ashley JensenJensenwas fetchingly eccentric as Ricky Gervaiss best friend, Maggie, in the Gervais Stephen Merchant-penned TV hit, Extras. She has gone on to refine her comedic and acting gts in TV and in film, including Ugly Betty and Agatha Raisin. The good news is that she can be seen alongside Gervais again in After Le, Rickys latest dark comedy, in which he plays a man struggling after the death of his we. It starts on Netflix on March . Ford Kiernan and Greg HemphillThe co-creators, writers and stars of Still Game and Chewinrsquo The Fat have more than earned their place among the upper echelons of Scottish comedyrsquos hall of fame, gting the nation an enduring lexicon that includes ldquoTwo pints, p**** ldquoThatrsquos plenty! ldquoYoursquove taken that too far and ldquoTake a drink!. Ronnie CorbettBoth venerated and under-ratedEdinburgh-born Corbett came for the fore during the satire boom of the s. But it was in the s and s that his star truly ascended, courtesy of his double act with Ronnie Barker and the programme they fronted, The Two Ronnies. Notionally he was the straight guy, but only notionally as subsequent generations of comics knew full well: David Walliams, Matt Lucas, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were among those who sought him out in his later years. Frankie BoyleDark and pessimistic humour. Close to the bone jokes. Brutal analogies. Boyle stokes controversy with his no-holds-barred subject matter. A rare family-newspaper-friendly sample: ldquoLas Vegas and Glasgow have a lot in common: theyrsquore the only two places in the world where you can pay for sex with chips. Kevin BridgesImpish, irreverent, clever, the natural successor to Connolly on the comedy stage ndashhe has the desire to keep going. Bridges manages to take seemingly ordinary le experience and turn it into something far less than ordinary. And he clearly has a head for political satire. \"Working in Poundstretcher for no wageshellipworking in a shop where everything is worth a quid except you. Elaine C SmithA bona fide national treasure, Elaine C Smithrsquos career to date has encompassed not just comedy but also singing, straight acting , journalism, political campaigning, even teaching, all delivered with the aplomb and brio of a natural raconteur who excels at everything she turns her hand to.Typically, however, she has a more self-effacing take on the motives behind her genre-defying years in the spotlight. The idea, she once said, is to ldquojust keep moving ndash yoursquoll be less of a target. Seriously, though, nobody is likely to be taking aim at the star, who turned  last year: the charisma oozing from her when shersquos in character is unforced, and off-stage shersquos as warm, personable, generous and defiantly un-starry as you would expecther to be.Smithrsquos list of achievements and associations runs the gamut from Ato, wellnot Z than at least as far as W, standing for Wildcat Theatre. Smith first encountered its politically-inspired progenitor, :, at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow as an -year-old and, suitably inspired, performed regularly with Wildcat throughout the s, including in the original production of The Steamie. Among her other credits in serious acting roles are BBC One drama Two Thousand Acres Of Sky and Kay Mellorrsquos hit series The Syndicate.But itrsquos for her contribution to comedy that shersquos best known and in particular for the role filed under M: Mary Nesbitt, aka Mary Doll, aka the long-suffering spouse to Govan nersquoer-do-well Rab C Nesbitt, he of string vest and filthy gutties fame.Smith clocked up her first of many Rab C episodes when the show debuted with a one-off pilot episode in late , and she was still there in  for the New Yearrsquos Day Special which found Rab fighting the bedroom tax. As an integral part of the much loved and award-winning show, shersquos now firmly embedded in Scotlandrsquos cultural DNA.Nobody will ever hail Mary as a role model for Scottish women or a worthwhile advert for hands-off parenting, but as an iconic comic character therersquos no touching her, and itrsquos hard to see who  in the Scottish acting firmament could have done her justice.Away from the dysal world of the Nesbitt family Smithrsquos comic skills have been put to good use in pantomimeand in less nihilistic TV sitcoms such as City Lights, in which she starred alongside the great Gerard Kelly, and in current hit Two Doors Down .Importantly, Smith also developed her own one-woman show, first mounting it in the mid-s and blazing an inspiring trail for a generation of younger Scottish actresses and comics to follow. And follow they have, another reason Elaine C Smith sits so high on our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.An Audience with Elaine C Smith, Kings Theatre, March  Armando IannucciIn an era when fake news is both a reality and a slur to be flung at reputable media organisations by emotionally incontinent politicians, it often feels ascurrent affairs and the reporting off them have moved way beyond satire. Which may explain why Glasgow-born writer, producer, director and arch-satirist Armando Iannucci is heading into space for his next project ndash Avenue , a sci-fi comedy for HBO starring Hugh Laurie.Butthe next chapter in the Scotrsquos comic journey takes place off-planet he leaves behind a treasure trove of earth-bound gems and itrsquos on account of that three decade back catalogue that he ranks so highly in our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.Cerebral and opinionated, with a liking for the scabrous and possessed of the outsiderrsquos eye which is vital for satire, Iannucci cut his teeth at BBC Radio Scotland in the late s on the likes of Norsquo The Archie McPherson Show. But those same gnashers first left their mark on the wider cultural landscape when he co-created Steve Cooganrsquos Alan Partridge character for BBC Radio rsquos On The Hour in . In  Iannucci and On The Hour co-star Chris Morris took the show to television as news parody The Day Today but Coogan and Iannucci would continue the Partridge association across three more series following the inimitable Alan, surely one of British comedyrsquos greatest creations, from the highs of television stardom to the lows of a static caravan and a berth on Radio Norfolk.In , Channel  gave Iannucci his own self-titled show. Inexplicably, it ran for only one season but had it not then we may have missed out on the show that came next ndash The Thick Of It, a fly-on-the-wall style mockumentary which debuted in  and burrowed its way into the heart of the New Labour machine where it dispensed satirical headbutts to one and all. Many, though not all, of these were delivered by another inspired Iannucci creation, spin doctor and full-time sociopath Malcolm Tucker. He was played in the show by Peter Capaldi, another Glaswegian of Italian descent whose family were actually near-neighbours of the Iannuccis in Springburn.Of course with so much of the UKrsquos political and media landscape being influenced and affected by the United States, the endlessly ambitious Iannucci was never going to limit himself to these shores. In , he adapted The Thick Of It for cinema and dropped hapless British government minister Tom Hollander into Washingtonrsquos then un-drained political swamp where he was pitted against boorish American general James Gandolfini. The film was called In The Loop and it won Iannucci an Oscar nomination.Three years later he created Veep for HBO. Starring former Seinfeld stalwart Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the US Vice President it took the TTOI format and tweaked it to create a hilarious political comedy which did for le in the West Wing what TTOI had done for the fictitious Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship . Veep is now in its seventh and final season and the previous six were all nominated for Emmy Awards. To date it was won , including Outstanding Comedy Series for the last three years running.So, itrsquos space next for Armando Iannucci, a place where no-one can hear you scream . Butthe Scot remains true to form, donrsquot think you wonrsquot be doing exactly that. Billy ConnollyWHAT makes Billy Connolly not only the greatest comedian in the UK, but the world  Wersquove long attached superlatives to his name, long tried to wonder what makes the Glaswegian so funny. There are those who cite Sir Billyrsquos surrealist streak and highlight how the former shipyard worker was influenced by the great Chic Murray.But what is it about Connolly thatrsquos allowed him to become a global superstar, a comedian, actor, documentary film maker and half decent banjo player  What defines him INSECURITY: All the great comedians are blessed with tragic insecurity and Connolly is no exception. It instils constant searching, an analysis of the world around which they keep trying to make sense of, in the hope that along the way it can provide comedy gold. ldquoI think my securities far outweigh my insecurities, he said. ldquoI am not nearly as afraid of myself and my imagination as I used to be.But that wasnrsquot always the case at all. Recalling the seven year-old schoolboy who fell in a puddle and was laughed at, Connolly realised that being mocked was far better than being beaten by nuns, or the Aunt who looked after him, or his father who sexually abused him. He knew then that escape from perpetual misery involved making people laugh and actually enjoyed his puddle moment. But he also knewhe were to become a comedian he would have to cultivate a personality, to ldquomake myself look windswept and interesting.It took time however. The quest involved the teenager experimenting with several worlds, from libraries to the Scouts, to cycling clubs to a religious group with whom he would travel to houses and read the Rosary to those ldquowaiting to watch the Beverly Hillbillies.CAMPERY: Even during his years in the shipyards, Connolly was never reluctant to draw attention to himself, with outrageous footwear and outfits so far away from the regulation Burton The Tailor two-piece. Later on, this inveterate show-offrsquos stage outfits were never quite a threat to Elton,but he came close. No opportunity was ever missed to surprise, whether appearing in lurex, banana boots or deck chair jackets. The result provided a delicious incongruity the insecure clown on stage telling jokes about his grim childhood, yet doing so with a continuous flick of highlighted hair, or a swish of the silky poncho.HAIR: Connolly certainly put his hair to good use. He has always had a very good head of it, which allowed him to leave the shipyard aged . Anyone with less hair would never have dared to enter the milieu that was the Scottish folk scene in the Sixties. The folk scene was really a front however for his true intent to follow Jimmy Logan and Stanley Baxter onto the entertainment circuit, and make the world laugh. But the hair suggested dferent characters he could be the urban philosopher, he could be a hippie, before later taking on a grander power and nailing his audience with the Crucixion.AWARENESS OF REALITY: Connolly was shaped, moulded, battered and plated by the experience of working as a boilerman in the shipyards, from the ages of -. Yet, while that provided reams of raw material for a comedy act, Connolly hadnrsquot yet worked up the courage to make the leap. Indeed, it took a colleague in the yards who told him to leave and never come back, to see him go off and pursue the dream.Connolly, however, was clever enough to know he wasnrsquot ready to go it alone and for a while held the hands of Humblebumsrsquo musicians Tam Harvey and Gerry Rafferty. And he was aware, that when matched with Rafferty, he was out of his depth. ldquoIrsquove got a voice like a goose farting in a tunnel, he admitted. ldquoAnd Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge.BOLDNESS: Comedy, not folk music, was the future and success grew in Scotland with the release of his live albums. In , a taxi driver told Michael Parkinson how good the Big Yin was and he landed an invite. But how many comedians when offered the chance to appear on the biggest chat show in the land would tell a joke about we-murdering, sexual depravity and cheeky bicycle-parking  Connollyrsquos manager Frank Lynch figured this career was over before it really began. Wrong, Frank. So wrong.REFUSAL TO BE CONSTRAINED: If Billy Connolly once had to battle with an inferiority complex, being told he was useless by the aunt he lived with, he did a very good job of hiding it as his career rolled on. If anyone every bothered to tell him he could never become a playwright, he certainly didnrsquot listen.If anyone mentioned he couldnrsquot become a pop star, that too fell on deaf ears and he appeared on Top of The Pops several times with pastiches of Tammy Wynettersquos DIVORCE and the Village Peoplersquos In The Navy. .What was also apparent was Connolly wasnrsquot afraid to cause political upset, to create ide, at one time describing the newly devolved Scottish government as ldquoa pretendy wee parliament. The man who at one time owned homes in Aberdeenshire, New York and Malta, believed himself to be a citizen of the world. And somehow he got away with his critiques because, well, he was above it all.SOCIAL CHAMELEONISM: Connolly has been able to adapt to and fit in to a iety of worlds. His film career brought him into the orbit of the showbiz greats, the likes of Robin Williams and the Pythons, but far from feeling out of his depth, the Scot not only thrived but fed on his new source material. He discovered being Glaswegian could be a bonus. He made Glaswegians, for the first time, believe something very positive could come out of a housing scheme.WRITING: But itrsquos his comic writing that confirms the manrsquos genius. Aged , he moved to the Glasgow housing scheme, Drumchapel. He said later, ldquoDrumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, itrsquos in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation. His similes are close to perfect. After appearing on the same bill as Elton John in the States in , the Scot was hit on the head with a pipe. ldquoThey made me feel as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit, he said later.HErsquoS A VARIETY ARTIST: While Connolly could come up with Chic Murray like aphorisms ndash ldquoMarriage is a great invention ndash but then so is the bicycle repair kit, or brilliant parodies such as the Crucixion, he has never been afraid to bend towards the Bernard Manning ldquoIf women are so bloody perfect at multi-tasking, how come they canrsquot have a headache and sex at the same time. Or how about: ldquoA biker goes to the doctor with hearing problems. lsquoCan you describe the symptoms to me rsquo lsquoYes. Homer is a fat yellow lazy b****** and Marge is a skinny bird with big blue hair!AND A PSYCHOLOGIST: Connolly offers big performance. No Rich Hall -side-of-mouth-jokes. He doesnrsquot just tell you a funny story. He throws it right onto your face. But he also understands and highlights the fragilities and complexities of the human condition, revealed with his line, \"Never trust a man, who when left alone with a tea cosey doesnt try it on.\" Even his throwaway comments ldquoBigotry is a hobby in Glasgow canrsquot fail to resonate.SELF-DEPRECATION: He can be in your face and seemingly confident but knows his limits and when to rein it in. Connolly, for example, points out he is usually killed off in the first  minutes of his movies. But he can act as he revealed in Queen Victoria biopic Mrs Brown, a perfect vehicle for his ability to switch from aggression to tenderness in the flick of an eyelid. But itrsquos also hard to see past his deliciously quixotic role in  dark comedy What We Did On Our Holiday.HErsquoS A SALESMAN: Connolly has sold Glasgow to the world. Okay, it wasnrsquot a shortbread tin version of his hometown, more a rusty Spam tin, with bits of stale meat still inside, but he never, ever failed to make it funny. Where Joycersquos Ulysses transformed the image of Dublin from a backwater to a metropolis, Connolly too has sold his hometown, its colour and vibrancy, its humour as dark as a boilermakerrsquos overalls.HErsquoS A FIGHTER: Billy Connolly offers up the black comedy line, ldquoIrsquove got Parkinsonrsquos Disease. And I wish tae f*** hersquod take it back. But at the same time Sir Billy is entirely aware of the impact hersquos had on so many people. And so he should be. \"Im very lucky in as much as I made a bit of a mark, and you think, well, I must have done something right.The Glasgow International Comedy Festival runs from March -.

It isnrsquot. Itrsquos pitched at an internal audience.In particular, itrsquos pitched at those many SNP members who are suspicious of the leadershiprsquos Growth Commission, the hair-shirt economic blueprint for an independent Scotland written by former MSP turned corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson.A heresy against the  White Paper, the Commissionrsquos report recommended spending Decade One after a Yes vote driving down debt and keeping a tight grip on public spending. It also backed keeping the pound ndash at least for now.Ms Sturgeon declared herself delighted, the membership less so. Besides the whf of austerity, there was that plan to keep sterling and UK monetary policies. Former SNP MPs such as George Kerevan politely but firmly laid into it.After hosting a series of National Assemblies to hear the views of SNP members, Mr Brown will put a motion to Aprilrsquos conference backing most of the Commissionrsquos  recommendations, but with a more gung-ho line on currency.Writing for the home crowd in The National yesterday, Mr Brown said: ldquoWe will propose that it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency. So far, so clear. But then the fog descends.ldquoOf course, until that can be done safely and securely, our currency would continue to be the pound sterling. It must be done at the right time, in a way that affords necessary protection for our nationrsquos economy and for peoplersquos personal finances.ldquoThe aim of an SNP government would be to complete preparations in time for the newly independent Scottish Parliament, informed by assessments and information from the Central Bank, to take a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of its first term.ldquoThis will ensure that the use of sterling is not an open-ended commitment ndash an issue raised at the National Assemblies.The language is new. But at best, the leadership has moved from agnosticism on a new currency to a highly caveated inclination. Yet something that heavily caveated isnrsquot really a belief in anything. Itrsquos a fudge. Itrsquos also a muddle.For example, Mr Brown seems to suggest evidence and economics would count, but also that Holyrood would decide to back a currency on a set timetable regardless.A politically brave idea, as it would make the following election a referendum on whether to follow through with that decision.Mr Brown also reminds me of someone daydreaming about how theyrsquoll spend their lottery millions before theyrsquove even bought a ticket. It may be enjoyable, but therersquos the small matter of winning first. It was noticeable he didnrsquot offer a timetable on actually securing independence.The audience for this mush is clear from the last line, where he says activists at the partyrsquos National Assemblies didnrsquot like the idea of an open-ended commitment to sterling.They must be a conspiratorial lot. The Growth Commission never made an open-ended commitment to sterling. It said it should be used until something  made more sense, as did the SNP Governmentrsquos Fiscal Commission before the  referendum. Both said sterling was best initially because the UK and Scottish economies were so aligned.But both were open to a new currencythe economies erged. The Commission proposed six tests on credibility, markets, debt, trade, reserves , and public appetite. Explaining the process to voters before a referendum was an ldquoabsolutely necessity, it said. Both were also clear context was all. There was no dogmatism about having or not having a new Scottish currency. It all came down to the circumstances. They definitely did not say, lsquoLetrsquos do this in the first term of an independent parliament to keep the troops happy.rsquoBut it seems National Assembly-goers live in dread of an indefinite backstop on the currency, and want to put a time limit on it, whether itrsquos rational or not. How very ERG-like.I suspect that, behind the fudge, the SNP hierarchy is keeping faith with the Growth Commission, because it sees sense in it, while talking more warmly about a new currency to molly the members.This could backfire on several fronts. The members could see straight through it and get more disgruntled. It was interesting how much scepticism there was from senior SNP figures who want a new currency yesterday. The leadership is not trusted on this. Even vague talk of a new currency could become a giant bullseye for Unionists, who would use to it attack the SNP as reckless and flaky. The party has, after all, backed the euro, the pound, and now, sort of, a third currency.It does not seem driven by long-term national interest, but by short-term party management. The Tories have their Eurosceptics to placate, the SNP their sterling-sceptics.The key thing is whether it helps the cause. But who does this idea appeal to outside the  per cent Will a mystery currency move a single No voter to Yes  Did people reject independence because the last currency offer wasnrsquot radical enough  Did they object to their wages and pensions staying in sterling  Were they crying out to take a punt on a Scottish pound Mr Brown seems to think so. ldquoI believe this approach will maximize support for an independent Scotland, he wrote yesterday. I believe he may be disappointed."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-scottish-labour-needs-a-leader-not-a-follower","story":"The th century Russian novelistrsquos wise words could apply to Scottish Labour, perhaps the most dysal brood in UK politics.Richard Leonard heads to Dundee this week for his second party conference as leader. He wants to pitch himself as a potential First Minister and present his party as a united family to voters.Gary Smith, who leads a trade union that employed Leonard for more than  years, appears not to have been sent the harmony memo.According to Smith, Scottish Labour has failed on Brexit and been weak on anti-Semitism. Damningly, he says Leonardrsquos strategy of ldquoriding on the coat-tails of Jeremy Corbyn wonrsquot work. In boxing terms, Smith has delivered a first-round knock-out.His analysis also happens to be shared by a growing body of opinion within Scottish Labour. I accept Leonard and Corbyn are close politically, but ideological similarities do not require a leader to surrender his autonomy and behave like a parrot.Brexit is his biggest failure. Leonard, much to the frustration of his MSPs and party members, has echoed Corbynrsquos Euroscepticism and opted to say as little as he can get away with on a second referendum. Both men want to strangle this option.Leonardrsquos hostility to a public vote is against the backdrop of over % of voters in Scotland supporting Remain in . Opinion polls show that backing for staying in the European Union has grown since the referendum. And yet, despite these facts, Leonard has bizarrely manoeuvred himself into the position of being the most pro-Brexit leader at Holyrood.His sleepy approach to the anti-Semitism row provides further evidence that his gut instinct is to defer to Corbyn. When the UK Labour leader resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism last year, Leonardrsquos response should have been swt and decisive.ldquoThe party should sign up to the IHRA and all the associated examples, without hesitation. We must make amends with the Jewish community, the statement should have read.Leonard instead gave a feeble interview to the BBC during which he offered warm words to Jews, but nothing . Corbyn eventually performed a U-turn and, asby magic, so did Leonard. It is clear some of his supporters believe the anti-Semitism scandal has been exaggerated to damage the Corbyn project.As a result of his back-seat leadership, Leonardrsquos fortunes are now tied to the electoral performance of Corbyn. He has failed to exercise the autonomy many of his predecessors worked so hard to extract from the UK party. His team is effectively a satellite of the Leader of the Oppositionrsquos Office at Westminster.He may also regret trying to use Corbyn as his meal ticket to Bute House, as there is little evidence of a ldquoJC bounce in Scotland. As Smith pointed out, although Scottish Labour made gains at the last general election, the party only put on , votes compared with the previous poll. Around , of these were in Edinburgh South, where Ian Murray was explicitly anti-Corbyn.Two rows are brewing that will inevitably fuel Labour faction-fighting. On Holyrood selections, Leonard allies want him to use his majority on the partyrsquos Executive to hand-pick List candidates for next Scottish Parliament election. Such a move would be brutal, and could inject fresh blood into a jaded group of MSPs, but it would backfireit was used to install middle aged under-achievers from the trade union movement.The partyrsquos ldquoorganisational review, led by deputy leader Lesley Laird, is the other potential flashpoint. Scottish Labour Kremlinologists see it as an attempt to restrict the power of general secretary Brian Roy and his team. Insiders say UK Labour is already micro-managing Scottish Labour finances in an unprecedented way.Leonard is a nice man. He has a big heart and was a more authentic representative of Labour values than Anas Sarwar, who he defeated for the leadership. But he is flailing and his party is heading towards another thumping defeat. Scottish Labour needs a leader, not a follower."},{"url":null,"title":"boost-for-theresa-may-as-key-tory-signals-brexit-support","story":"Sir Graham Brady indicated he could swing behind the Prime Ministerrsquos Withdrawal Agreement ahead of crunch Commons votes as he expressed optimism about a breakthrough over the Northern Ireland backstop.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Sir Graham said: ldquoThe whole country is tired of vacillation and delay.ldquoWhen the right compromise is offered, we should pull together behind the Prime Minister and help her to deliver our exit from the European Union on March .Many Brexiteers have expressed opposition to the backstop as it would leave the UK obeying EU customs rulesno wider trade deal is agreed after a transition period.Sir Graham, who branded the Governmentrsquos handling of the Brexit negotiations as ldquolions led by donkeys, indicated there was a growing mood for a deal in the Commons.He said:ldquoThis is not a time to make the best the enemy of the good, and most MPs are in a mood to compromise, but the danger of this backstop becoming permanent is a real one and it has to be tackled.ldquoMy conversations with senior diplomats and politicians from across Europe have given me cause for optimism that a breakthrough is near.ldquoThose who have pressed for delay or for no-deal to be taken off the table have weakened Theresa Mayrsquos hand and made a deal less likely, but I still believe a compromise is fundamentally in our interest and that of the EU.ldquoOnce we have that, my colleagues in Parliament need to recognise the strength of feeling.The comments came as the Sunday Times reported that the hardline European Research Groupof Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg has drawn up ldquothree tests the Government must pass to win backing.In private talks with Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the Governmentrsquos legal advice, the newspaper said.The stance has been drawn up in conjunction with the DUP, according to the Sunday Times.The manoeuvring follows Mrs May telling MPs the Commons will have a ldquomeaningful vote on her Brexit plans by March .The PM said thather deal is rejected, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, andthat is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article  and delay Brexit.Meanwhile, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he does not believethe UK will have enough time to approve Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal deal by the scheduled exit date of March .Mr Barnier suggested a ldquotechnical extension of up to two months may be needed.Askedhe thought it was possible to reach an agreement by March , evenWestminster gave the green light this month, Mr Barnier told Spainrsquos El Mundo newspaper: ldquoNo."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-accuses-tories-of-grubby-brexit-bung-with-more-cash-for-northern-ireland","story":"The funds are on top of the pound billion-plus block grant allocated under the Barnett model for devolved regions.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said on Thursday the money recognises the lack of opportunity for ldquofundamental service reconfiguration in the current financial year.The SNP has demanded to know when Scotland will receive a comparable share of extra cash, saying an equivalent share for the country ndash which has a larger population than Northern Ireland ndash would be pound million.The party has accused the Conservative Government of ldquodelivering a grubby Brexit bung to buy off DUP votes ahead of crucial votes on Brexit this month.UK ministers have insisted the pound million is to address specic challenges in Northern Ireland.SNP economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman has written to Scottish Secretary David Mundell, asking ious questions about the funding.The letter asks him: ldquoWhy do you support additional money for Northern Ireland but not a proportionate increase in funding for Scotland Commenting later, Ms Blackman, the MP for Aberdeen North, said: ldquoThe Tories are delivering another bung for the DUP, ripping up the rule book in the process.ldquoButthe rules are to be applied as they should be, then Scotlandrsquos fair share would amount to an extra pound million for public services here.this additional funding will not result in Barnett consequentials for Scotland.

They tell me theyrsquoll read the same books to their children, and I imagine in years to come those children reading Seuss to their own sons and daughters long after Irsquom gone.After I published my first novel, I began writing stories for my children, but I soon realised Irsquod never have the magic of Seuss - whorsquos been called the Milton, the Renoir, of childrenrsquos writing. So I began studying the le of Ted Geisel - I wanted to know what shaped this genius.Itrsquos a good time to tell his story: yesterday was Dr Seuss Day, when hersquos celebrated around the world, and Thursday is World Book Day - an excuse for children to dress up as their favourite literary characters. Unsurprisingly, the Cat in the Hat is one of the most ubiquitous outfits.Ted was a complex man, his soul could be as light as a childrsquos, yet his le - which charted the th century and took in many of its great themes such as war, wealth, race and changing social values - was often full of the pain of adulthood.He was born into a wealthy immigrant German family in the town of Springfield, Massachusetts, in , and named Theodore Seuss Geisel. Itrsquos thought Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, set his anarchic cartoon in a fictional Springfield in homage to Seuss. From the very beginning, Tedrsquos le was a mix of word-play and imagination. The brewery his father owned - Kalmbach and Geisel - was known locally as lsquoCome Back and Guzzlersquo, and his mother, from a family of bakers, sang weird nonsense songs to him about pies.His father helped run the local zoo, and encouraged Ted to draw the animals he saw there. Tedrsquos pictures were strange caricatures - with too many knuckles, or spindly legs. His first character came from one of these lsquozoo drawingsrsquo - a beast with ears nine foot long which he called a lsquowynnmphrsquo.His niece Peggy Owens - who was as close to Seuss as a daughter - said: lsquoHe never lost the ability to see things through the eyes of a child.rsquo That ability to retreat into a world of imagination became more important to Ted as he got older. When the First World War broke out, Ted found himself bullied by other children because of his German roots and with the coming of prohibition in peace time, the family brewery was closed.Ted was no great scholar but he excelled at English, and after school he went on to Dartmouth College. While there, he spent most of his time writing for the collegersquos magazine Jack-O-Lantern - which carried cartoons and comic stories. Classes forgotten, hersquod be found in the morning, sleeping at his editorial desk. His niece Peggy said: lsquoHe simply never stopped playing hookey from the real world.rsquoA run-in with the law over a gin party during prohibition saw him banned from the magazine. But Ted got round the punishment by writing under a nom de plume: Seuss. Phyllis Cerf Wagner - the actress, socialite and writer who married Tedrsquos publisher Bennet Cerf, and was instrumental in the shaping of the Seuss legend - said: lsquoHe took his motherrsquos maiden name, Seuss, as he was saving Geisel for when he wrote the great American novel.rsquoFor now, though, the dizzying heights of literature were to evade him. He went to Oxford University in the hope of becoming an English professor, but dropped out. He spent most of his time at Oxford doodling in his notebook - which brought him to the attention of a bright young American woman called Helen Palmer. Looking over his shoulder in a lecture, she saw one of his pictures - a flying cow - and told him he should become an illustrator. Not long after, they ed to America and married. Helen was less a muse and more a mentor - she encouraged and helped shape his work, and she brought order to his le.Ted was no party animal - he was shy, nervous in public, and liked the company of close friends not big groups, though he did love a vodka on the rocks and plenty of cigarettes - however, the strictures of adulthood were not for him. Without Helen, it was said, he wouldnrsquot have been able to balance a chequebook.Ted became a jobbing cartoonist and by now had added lsquoDrrsquo to his pen-name - an in-joke about the doctorate hersquod failed to get at Oxford. His big break came by chance. In the s, Flit was a popular brand of fly-spray. Ted drew a one-off cartoon for Judge magazine showing a medieval knight who canrsquot sleep because therersquos a dragon in his bedroom. The punch line reads: lsquoDarn it all, another dragon. And just after I sprayed the whole castle with Flit.rsquoHe was hired on the spot to do all Flitrsquos ads. lsquoThis became one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history,rsquo one of his biographers, Janet Pascal, says. Financially comfortable, Ted now turned his attention towards his lelong ambition: writing and illustrating childrenrsquos books.Ted was infamous in his family for exaggeration - he was always embellishing the truth . His first big success was more than a little autobiographical. The book lsquoAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Streetrsquotells the story of a child out for a walk who imagines a fantastical adventure. A suburban afternoon becomes filled with make-believe giraffes, magicians, police - and a man with a ten foot beard.Initially, publishers turned the book down - it didnrsquot have a moral, they said - but finally it was bought and in  became a critical hit. Beatrix Potter was a fan, saying she adored lsquothe truthful simplicity of the untruthfulnessrsquo.Publicly, Tedrsquos le was on the up, but privately there was much sadness. His mother died before seeing his success, and his beloved sister Marnie drted into alcoholism and died whilst estranged from Ted. He and his we also learned they couldnrsquot have children. Ted would later invent an imaginary child lsquoChrysanthemum-Pearlrsquo and heartbreakingly dedicate a book to her. His friend and biographer Judith Morgan said: lsquoPart of his protection was to not allow himself to spend his le in grief, and perhaps thatrsquos why he found such joy in doing the outrageous books he did.rsquoHis next successful book, Horton Hatches The Egg, added the morality that Mulberry Street was seen to lack. It tells the story of an elephant, Horton, who finds an egg, abandoned by its mother, and sits on it in the hope of hatching it, in the face of threats and even the risk of being shot. lsquoShootyou must,rsquo says Horton, lsquoI wonrsquot run away. I meant what I said and I said what I meant, an elephant is faithful,  per cent.rsquoIt was a smash hit. Tedrsquos editor, Michael Frith, said: lsquoIn the hands of a gted preacher therersquos nothing more powerful than a great lesson.rsquoHorton appeared in . As war loomed, it would be seven years before Ted wrote another book. lsquoWhile Paris was being occupied by the clanking tanks of the Nazis,rsquo Ted said, lsquoI could no longer keep my mind on drawing pictures of Horton the elephant.rsquoToo old to fight, Ted enlisted and became a captain in one of the most remarkable propaganda outfits ever - the US armyrsquos First Motion Picture Unit. He worked with Mel Blanc , Chuck Jones , and Frank Caprachurning out films like Private Snafu - army slang for lsquoSituation Normal: All F****d Uprsquo - to boost the war effort.After the war, there was a social panic over the effect of TV on childrenrsquos literacy. Ted was challenged by his publisher to write a story for children learning to read using just  simple words. The limitations were tortuous but after a yearrsquos labour The Cat in the Hat was born - the story of a trickster cat who causes havoc in the lives of two young children.The book has been poured over by literary scholars. Itrsquos been subjected to Freudian analysisand to racial interpretations . To most, it simply captures the anarchy of childhood. Janet Schulman, an editor who worked closely with Ted, said: lsquoHe allowed a childrsquos imagination to guide him.rsquoTed was now re-writing the rules of how children learned to read. With Green Eggs and Ham, he reduced the number of words in the book to just  - making it a perfect primer - and was hailed as the saviour of childrenrsquos literacy, replacing stale Peter and Jane with the crazy Fox in Socks.Now the most important childrenrsquos author in the world, Tedrsquos stories became more political. The Sneetches savages American racism The Butter Battle Book mocks the Cold War The Lorax is an environmentalist fable. His politics often upset conservative America.In , after struggling with ill health, and depression over Tedrsquos affair with Audrey Stone Dimond, a friend of the family, Helen took her own le. Ted married Audrey less than a year later.Tedrsquos last book is one of his most loved - Oh, the Places Yoursquoll Go. Itrsquos Tedrsquos joyous take on le - his valediction to readers young and old. His agent, Jed Mattes, said it was lsquolike a wise grandfather sitting down and talking to a younger generationrsquo.In his last days, Ted, too unwell to make it to his bedroom, slept in his studio. He died in , just a few feet from his drawing board. After his death, the students of his old college, Dartmouth, recited his works for a full day, as a mark of respect to a man who had single-handedly shaped their childhood, and the collective childhood of us all."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  28 days to go and Westminster won   t even reject no deal  let alone back a People   s Vote","story":"I could give you a pious expression of naive hope.

Every country can benefit from graduates who have developed these attributes.Saudi Arabia, an oil rich dictatorship, was widely condemned last year over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The columnist was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered and dismembered by a hit squad.One of the suspects is Dr Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, a forensic pathologist who specialises in autopsies, and who allegedly used his skills to dismember Khashoggi.A number of media outlets, including the Herald, reported that he used to study at Glasgow University, prompting rector Aamer Anwar to urge the institution to ldquobreak all links with the Kingdom.Other than the Khashoggi scandal, a recent report by Amnesty International stated that Saudi Arabia ldquoseverely restricts freedom of expression, association and assembly. Its bombing of Yemen has also been condemned.The Herald on Sunday asked universities how much they had received in tuition fees - both undergraduate and postgraduate - from students from Saudi Arabia and other despotic regimes.Twelve institutions have taken in over poundm since  from Saudi students, with Glasgow University leading the way on pound.m.Glasgowrsquos website states: ldquoThe university has a long-established relationship with Saudi Arabia and we have been welcoming students here for many decades.In second place is Strathclyde University, which received over poundm from students from the same country.Strathclyde Universityrsquos website states: ldquoStrathclyde has a long history of welcoming students from Saudi Arabia.Edinburghs total stands at around pound.m. The same university accepted around poundm from a foundation created by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, to establish an Islamic study centre.However, Scottish universities have received a far larger sum, nearly poundm, from Chinese students. Edinburgh benefited to the tune of poundm over three years, while Glasgow took in pound.m.According to the latest Amnesty report, China continues to draft new laws that present ldquoserious threats to human rights.The same report stated that the regime has strict controls on internet use, represses religious activities and attacks freedom of expression in Hong Kong.Ten universities received over poundm in fees from Russia-based students, with Edinburgh again topping the fee list.Vladimir Putinrsquos autocratic leadership has been marked by crackdowns on opposition politicians, as well as assassinations in the UK. Putin critics have long argued that regime-friendly oligarchs have spent their wealth in countries such as the UK.There is no suggestion that students should be blamed for the actions of their rules, but campaigners believe the amount of money involved raises wider questions.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \"International students shouldnt be punished for the atrocities and abuses of their governments, nor should they be treated as a revenue stream for underfunded universities.ldquoHowever,the universities themselves are entering into official government partnerships or offering support to the regimes then questions need to be asked.ldquoThe Chinese, Russian and Saudi dictatorships all have utterly appalling human rights records, and Scottish universities should ensure they arent doing anything that could indicate support for them or legitimise them.\"MSP Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens education spokesperson said: ldquoThere is a massive dference between placing sanctions on those directly associated with a criminal regime and preventing all students from say Saudi Arabia from studying here.ldquoWhat we cannot allow is dependence on income from these students turning into institutional tolerance for oppressive regimes.

We didnrsquot succeed - thank god for that.At that time, the council had won an employment tribunal case saying that a job evaluation process it had completed a decade previously was sound. An appeals tribunal, however, had ruled that its practice of protecting bonuses that had previously been earned by male staff only was discriminatory.While the women were appealing the first decision and the council the second, Mr Cross said he would have been willing to draw a line under all proceedings to settle the payment protection part only.ldquoStatistically, therersquos only a % chance of overturning a tribunal decision so we knew there was a massive risk that we would lose the appeal - it was much more likely that we would lose than we would win, he said.ldquoWe thought we wouldnrsquot win until we got to the Supreme Court, although we didnrsquot even knowwe would get the possibility to get to the Supreme Court.ldquoWe didnrsquot know we would win at the Court of Session - that was the risk we were running - but it happened to be that we got a bench that clicked.After losing both appeals the council, which passed from Labour to minority SNP control in May , agreed to settle the claims, with the poundm deal being agreed this January after a year of negotiations. To help foot the bill the local authority, which will increase council tax by % this year, is mortgaging a portfolio of properties including the Riverside Museum and SEC Armadillo, with the annual cost of servicing that debt expected to run into tens of millions of pounds.Mr McAveety and Glasgow City Council both confirmed that the informal and unminuted meeting with Action  Equality took place, although they denied that the poundm figure had been discussed.ldquoThis did not happen, a council spokesman said. ldquoRepresentatives of ActionEquality restated their position that the council should stop defending equal-pay claims.ldquoHowever, officers are clear that no offer was made and that figure was not put to the council.Mr McAveety said that while he personally would have been in favour of negotiating an end to the dispute, his hands were tied by council officials who wanted to follow legal process.ldquoSenior officials said lsquothis is in the courts and therersquos been an employment tribunal ruling that has favoured the councilrsquo, he said.ldquoThe general discussion [at the meeting] was around the issue of the number of folk that Action  Equality were representing, an observation on the role of the trade unions and, from Stefan Crossrsquos point of view, that we should try to settle.ldquoIt was left to Robert Anderson and the chief executive [Annemarie OrsquoDonnell] to deal with and I never came back [to Action  Equality] because I thought there was no authorisation from the council.The eventual bill for the local authority is signicantly higher than Mr Crossrsquos original estimate because, in addition to the number of claimants more than doubling since June , it is compensating affected workers for having their jobs undervalued as well as for not being able to share in bonuses.The poundm figure covers the period from , when the discredited pay system was put in place, to either  or , with a further settlement expected to be negotiated to cover the period from that end point to when a new system is put in place.The new scheme is not expected to be implemented until  at the earliest, with , inidual jobs having to be assessed, compared and signed off by both the council and the womenrsquos union representatives first.The staff who are part of the claim are expected to start receiving their cash in the summer, with average payments in the region of pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"from-the-royal-mint-to-pure-minted-the-alphabet-of-scotland","story":"From the Angel of the North to Zebra crossings, the coins will be an A-Z of quintessential Britishness.The Loch Ness Monster will takes its place at ldquoL, which sparked a small debate in The Herald on Sunday offices over whether it should have appeared at ldquoN, for Nessie.So, in celebration of Nessie, Ron McKay has come up with his own list of quintessentially Scottish suggestions:A is for Arbroath, and the declaration of: Itrsquos what the home teamrsquos keeper exclaimed last month when his goal kick into a gale at Gayfield, on the lip of the North Sea, ended up as a corner for the other team with the ball eventually landing in Carnoustie.B is for Baw or Barsquo: Used as a prefix to a transportation receptacle, slang for male genitalia, and as a suffix for fit, and a game involving a leathern sphere wersquore notably bad at.

Ham is currently hogging American headlines due to an ongoing dispute with atheist pressure group the Freedom From Religion Foundation ndash who believe Ham is a bit of a swine. The FFRF promotes the separation of church and government ndash a rather bold endeavour in a state where Governor Matt Bevin recently declared ldquoThe Year of the Bible. Perhaps, understandably, FFRF mostly carry out their protests by way of the internet ndash you canrsquot shoot the head off an online petition, after all.The group is furious that pound million in state tax incentives have helped fund Hamrsquos creationist theme park, yet ndash to be fair ndash some state officials did try to stop these generous tax breaks after learning the hardcore creationist entrepreneur would only hire Christians. Fuelled by the stimulant of self-righteous indignation, however, Ham decided to sue the state in federal court ndash and brought home the bacon by winning his case. Impressed Kentucky politicians then saw fit to reward his indefatigable faith with another wee rebate check for . million. Praise the Lord, indeed.With the penny finally dropping that there may perhaps be some sympathetic fundamentalist mindsets on governmental boards, FFRF has now recalibrated its aim and taken direct action ndash sending letters to more than , public schools around Kentucky to highlight the mind-warping dangers of taking advantage of Hamrsquos offer of free class field trips to Ark Encounter.Certainly, the statue of a smiling diplodocus at the entrance is indicative of a wilfully ignorant and wildly subjective interpretation of the Earthrsquos four-and-a-half billion year history. Yet, where traditional theme parks such as Blackpool Pleasure Beach ultimately confirm there is no God, Ark Encounter solely exists to solidy belief in a ine creator and His miraculous six-day endeavour.A gay old timeARK Encounterrsquos piegravece de reacutesistance is, like it says on the tin, an ldquoaccurate -feet-long recreation of Noahrsquos Ark ndash complete with animatronic models of dinosaurs and humans living together in harmony, just like in The Flintstones. And Job :ndash,creationist Biblical interpretations of the word ldquobehemoth are to be believed.Yet, in a move not quite in the spirit of Christrsquos New Testament message of acceptance and love, all employees at the park are required to sign a ldquostatement of faith which explicitly prohibits them from employmenttheyrsquore ldquogay, bi, or a person who has attempted to alter gender by surgery or appearance.Itrsquos perhaps then no surprise that Ham also has a concurrent campaign to, ahem, ldquotake back the rainbow. Which was,we recall Sunday School storytime, first gted to the Earth by temperamental Old Testament tyrant Yahweh himself ndash in a plea for forgiveness after killing everyone in a pique of petulant fury at our so-called ldquosins, such as homosexuality and the like. Itrsquos certainly ironic that despite being heavily influenced by The Flintstones, Ham certainly wonrsquot ever tolerate a ldquogay old time.Jockrsquos on usSCOTS are, of course, children of the Enlightenment, sensibly secular of mind and progressively liberal enough to have earned a wee condescending chuckle at the backward beliefs of some of our American cousins.Despite all evidence to the contrary, however, many of us remain within the confines of this self-gratying bubble of ldquowharsquos like us  nonsense. The truth is, wersquore perhaps even more societally regressive than any dusty, confederate backwater in the American heartlands.In , MSP Alasdair Allan ndash who was the Minister for Learning, Science and Scotlandrsquos Languages ndash saw fit to officially respond to pressure from the militantly atheist Scottish Secular Society , boldly stating the obvious to his peers in Holyrood: ldquoGuidance provided by Education Scotland does not identy Creationism as a scientic principle. It should therefore not be taught as part of science lessons.And neither should enriching uranium yet no-onersquos banned that yet. So, perhaps with that in mind, Allan fell short of outlawing the teaching of a six-day creation period by a prankster transdimensional magician ndash adding a rather timorous postscript that any precedents of governmental intolerance would inevitably lead to ldquocalls for bans on other issues and the curriculum would risk becoming mired in legal arrangements.One wonders whether Allanrsquos a**e is still numb from such an awkward perch on the fence. His non-committal stance does, however, echo successive Scottish and UK governmentsrsquo deeply ingrained reluctance to condemn, or even recognise, the bleeding chasm of ision for which religious dogma is almost entirely responsible. Most folk free from the micro-management of thought caused by this ancient virus can clearly see its butterfly effect of societal paralysis, and on a micro scale, calcying the neurones of its host to protect itself against rival contagions ndash or any wildly idealistic notions of utopic unity and global harmony.That the sediment of fear and superstition remains the fundamental layer we build our communities and education system upon in  is bad enough, but the fact religionrsquos stagnated stench still clogs the corridors of power is surely the ultimate absurdity ndash with Scottish local authorities still being legally obliged to cower under the overriding authority of Tha Lawd on council education boards.Return of the JediITrsquoS a law that surely proves wersquore all either numbed within a collective hypnotic state or that reality truly is a simulation run by malevolent aliens ndash the absurd ruling that Scottish councils are still legally required to appoint three education committee members to represent a transdimensional creator skyspirit. Legally, all require one Catholic representative, one Church of Scotland and one ldquoother. Perhaps a Jedi would be appropriate ndash as therersquos more chance of a Darth Vader figure existing in an infinite universe than a temperamental creator with suspiciously human traits such as jealousy, fury and regret.Yet, despite the comedic costumes being a dead giveaway to their shoogly grasp on reality, the pious are somehow bestowed with entirely unearned respect and privilege in our society, particularly within the corridors of power ndash despite their myopic belief systems infecting every warped thought and utterance.Itrsquos surely right that we question why unelected purveyors of fancul fiction can operate freely from voter accountably and bear influence on how our children are educated. South Lanarkshire Councilrsquos Dr Nagy Iskander is one such presence ndash a creationist who has said that evolution is ldquoreally illogical.Incidentally, Iskander counts Ark Encounterrsquos Ken Ham as a personal friend ndash perhaps admiring how he has earned a very comfortable living by convincing the naive and desperate that his self-serving porkies are the gospel truth.And finally ...PERHAPS there really is no need to rush any official ban on teaching creationism in Scottish classrooms.It could be argued itrsquos putting the cart before the horse in a country where we still appoint believers in ancient Abrahamic superstitions to education boards ndash and continue to segregate children in accordance to parental allegiances to a supernatural entity who only ever existed in our speciesrsquo minds.At least our Kentuckian cousins donrsquot believe their omnipotent comfort blanket has any allegiance to a particular sports team. Just last week, ldquoProtestant ldquoCatholic and ldquowest of Scotland were among the highest trending terms on UK twitter.Perhaps The Flintstones has simply evolved into a social media reality show, starring yabba dabba you and me. Therersquos certainly no need to build an Ark Encounter theme park in a country populated and led by dinosaurs, already fully submerged and drowning in destructive

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Sunday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage. I went to a clinic for HIV sufferers, and I went to a slum’.”Dooley is not a villain. She shouldn’t be expected to carry the can for Comic Relief’s enduring colonialism. But perhapsshe and others were exposed to more voices like McGrath’s, they would think twice about treating black children like some sort of fashion accessory. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"labour government would not agree to a second independence referendum","story":"A UK Labour Government would \"not agree to\" a second referendum on Scottish independence being held, Scottish leader Richard Leonard has said.There is \"no appetite\" for a second vote on leaving the UK and the partys next election manesto will oppose such a move, he added.It came after Nicola Sturgeon hinted she could be open to forming a Coalition Government with Labour in the event of a snap UK election, prompting speculation that anindependence referendum could be the price of SNP co-operation.Ms Sturgeon wants to hold a second vote on leaving the UK and will make a statement on her plans in the coming weeks.

And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

He said: \"We are sure the administrators will do all they can to try and ensure that creditors, particularly small local companies, are promptly paid.\"Badenoch MSP Kate Forbessaid: \"This shows once again how critically important Cairngorm Mountain is to the wider strath. Thats also why its such a relief the resort has a future with operators that appreciate the local impact.\"I can fully understand why there will be concerns amongst local businesses as they await the outcome of this process. I regularly ask HIE for updates to ensure the local community and economy are front and centre of all decisions they make.\"Regional MSP Edward Mountainsaid: \"I am hugely disappointed that businesses in the Highlands have been left out of pocket and this matter should be investigated fully.\"I strongly believe that the management structure of Cairngorm Mountain that has been used in recent years is not fit for purpose.\"A spokesman for Campbell Dallas, said investigating the conduct of directors is a statutory requirement in every insolvency. He commented: \"The content of the conductsubmitted to the Insolvency Service must remain confidential. As such, the joint administrators are unable to comment any further.\"The Strathy tried to contact Natural Retreats but got no response. The creditor balances were obtained by the administrators from CML records and can dfer from actual claims.Sunday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood. He said: “For me, it was the image that was in the press of the building and particularly the roof, which was covered in greenery. And immediately the choice for me was bracken.” Coming from North Wales, as a kid I used to play in bracken and hide and seek came to mind. It really was about the image that I saw # this wonderful rustic countryside and the roof camouflaging the building.”The resort will include  inidual accommodation pods and a #hub# building comprising a reception, bar, and restaurant. In a separate zone there will a sauna and outdoor plunge pool. Five staff accommodation pods will also be built, in addition to a -space car park.Mr Garton Jones said the project would create up to  jobs.: “We are hopeful of getting building work started by the summer, all being well. The funding is there so it is just a question of getting on with the build.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary,

The First Responders received its first donation on February . Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

Speaking after attending the coffee morning Carla Lockhart said: “I have a real passion for children and young people with additional needs. When the Assembly was sitting I championed these causes in all party groups and with the then Ministers.What the Special Olympics Cub does for these young people is amazing. The happiness and confidence they get from participation in sport and the socialising at the club is great to see. I want to continue with my work in championing these causes and lobbying for additional funding for worthwhile causes like this.”Picture Update: Royal visitors join children at SureStart scheme

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"full steam ahead for carryduff gaelscoil","story":"THE committee of a new Irish-medium nursery school in Carryduff has said it is confident it will open its doors as planned despite losing out on a proposed school building.The new naíscoil is expected to open in September this year and will pave the way for an Irish-medium primary in the area in .Gaelscoil an Aodha Dhuibh faced a setback recently after a lease on the proposed nursery site fell through. However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again.

It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit boost for pm as tories indicate support amid backstop move optimism","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It followed Tuesdays announcement that the Carnlough man had left the managers job at Celtic Park to take over at Leicester City.Speaking at a Leicester City Press conference yesterday, Rodgers said moving to the Premier League club was a dficult decision, but one that was \"too good to turn down\".\"It wasnt easy.

bpanews_abf-e-c-a-fde_EmailScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has appeared to suggest a Labour government in Westminster would oppose granting a further referendum on Scottish independence..pushQuestioned on the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programmea Labour government in Westminster, ed by a snap election, would allow a second Scottish independence referendum, he said his party did not support a further referendum and claimed there was “no appetite for it”.Pressed further on whether a Section  Order required for the referendum would be refused, he said a Labour government “would not agree to a second independence referendum”.His comments follow increasing speculation that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will call for the power to hold a second referendum in the near future – expected to be rejected by Westminster – having said in January she would set out her thoughts on the issue in the “coming weeks”.Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay was interviewed on the same programme and believesScotland leaves the UK following a second independence referendum, a forecast GDP deficit of around % can be halved faster than the five to  years predicted by a leading economist.Were proposing continuing with the pound and we have the ambition to have an independent Scottish currency and we have set out a plan to take us thereDerek Mackay, Scottish Finance SecretaryFacebookTwitterIn a major sht in SNP policy, Mr Mackay and SNP depute leader Keith Brown will put forward a motion to the party’s conference next month to adopt as the official party line that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency.The plan envisages Scotland using the pound during a transition period following a vote to leave the UK, aiming for the Scottish Parliament deciding on establishing the new currency by the end of its first term in an independent Scotland.In the run-up to the  referendum, then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a UK-wide currency union – a proposition rejected by parties opposing independence.Mr Mackay was questioned on advice from economist Andrew Wilson who predicted a GDP deficit of around % following independence and suggested this should be halved over five to  years before any independent Scottish currency was introduced.The forecast was made in a May  report by the Growth Commission, set up by Scotland’s First Minister to draw up a new economic blueprint for independence following the  referendum.Mr Mackay said the deficit could be reduced more quickly than forecast, but denied such a move would accelerate austerity.“We could reduce that notional deficit, of course that’s the deficit for being part of the United Kingdom, and accelerate the economic growth,” he told the programme.“After we published the Growth Commission report, our economics, our financial position is improving.”He added: “We want to be part of the European Union and we’re not proposing the euro.“We’re proposing continuing with the pound and we have the ambition to have an independent Scottish currency and we have set out a plan to take us there.”Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats claim the Growth Commission plans would lead to austerity."},{"url":null,"title":"nobel prize of towering economist goes under the hammer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC

And, it was just before his arrival in Derry for the visit that he learned of the surfacing of the British document in question.In August,  Martin Galvin led a group of  Americans on a fact-finding tour of the North organised by Sinn Fein. The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation. When we met in the Guildhall with eight councillors and Deputy Mayor Derek Hussey, I referred to the memo and noted that the last time I brought an American delegation to the north and requested a meeting with the British and unionists I had been sent an Exclusion Order in reply.\"CAPTION: Martin Galvin being arrested by the RUC at Free Derry Corner in . The late Martin McGuinness can be seen on the fringe of the left handside of the phoptograph."},{"url":null,"title":"mobuoy toxic dump clean dependent funding says government department","story":"A government department has said that remediation works at the Mobuoy Road “toxic super dump” in Derry will not commence unless funding is secured.The comments made by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairscome ahead of a scheduled community meeting at Drumahoe Primary School on March  at which people have been encouraged to demand answers and a clean-up of the site after years of inaction.The Mobuoy Road waste site consists of two distinct parcels of land, namely the City Industrial WasteSite and the Campsie Sands and Gravelssite – situated .km east of Derry and occupying a signicant  hectares of land – the equivalent of  rugby pitches.It has been acknowledged by environmental experts that the illegal dump poses serious risks to the River Faughan, which runs alongside it, and supplies % of the city’s drinking water.Eamonn McCann has been vocal about the urgent need for a clean-up operation over the years and raised Mobuoy in his first speech at Stormont as an MLA.  He also said that people were aware of illegal activities at the site.Yesterday, Mark H. Durkan MLA described it as a “ticking time bomb” which could turn a “huge environmental crime” into an “even bigger environmental crisis”.Previous waste management activities on the CIW site include an old landfill regulated by the legacy Derry City Council.At the stakeholder meeting on November , , the estimated volume of controlled waste illegally disposed at the Mobuoy waste site was reported to be a minimum of , m.The nature of the illegal deposits includes municipal waste, construction and demolitionwaste and municipal waste mixed with CD waste.Both the CIW site and CSG site have been subject to illegal waste disposal activities, according to local council officials.Paul Hughes has been a member of the Mobuoy Road Stakeholders Forum which has been meeting at regular intervals over the past number of years.The forum is made up of local youth and community representatives, elected representatives as well as members of the River Faughan Anglers.‘Justice for Mobuoy’At recent meetings remediation options have been explored and outlined by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency in terms of cleaning up this illegal toxic “super dump” - which is understood to be one of the biggest illegal landfills in all of Europe.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Hughes said: “We are continuously told that that the Department is working towards cleaning up the dump.

What a statement to make.“Mobuoy Dump must be cleaned up without further delay. The floods of August  proved just how fragile the situation is.  The River Faughan remains under constant threat from pollution.“We should all be concerned about the issue.  We must all stand up for the Faughan.  I would encourage everyone to get along to this meeting and ask questions. I would suggest that everyone writes down all their questions and puts them directly to the NIEA on Wednesday th of March.”He added: “Our elected representatives have failed Mobuoy and have failed the River Faughan.  Despite a public inquiry having been unanimously agreed back in , it never ever happened.“Its time for concerned citizens to take control of this process and now is the time to demand that Mobuoy Dump be cleaned up once and for all and lessons learnt do that a disaster like this is never allowed to happen again.“It’s time to stand up for the River Faughan.  Make a point to attending this meeting, demand answers, demand a full clean up, demand a public inquiry. Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier.

To suggest it should is to fail to understand how the Barnett formula works.”“This problem lies at the door of David Mundell, who has disgracefully failed to fight Scotland’s corner right the way through the Brexit process.“This extra cash for Northern Ireland comes just before Theresa May brings her bad Brexit deal back to Parliament - where every MP’s vote will count.Theresa May Brexit boost as DUP and ERG table proposals over backstop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“And it is crystal clear that the Tories are delivering a grubby Brexit bung to buy off DUP votes whilst Scotland’s voice in the Brexit process is ignored.”A UK Government spokeswoman said: “Like previous Northern Ireland support packages, or funding for city and growth deals in Scotland, the £ million funding addresses specic challenges.“As there has been no increase in spending on devolved matters in England, this additional funding will not result in Barnett consequentials for Scotland.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The deaths has been reported to the coroner.It comes as almost , patient accidents or falls were reported between November  and December .Of the five unexpected deaths to patients known to mental health services, one was found hanging at home but the cause of deaths of the other patients are not yet confirmed.One dental patient was diagnosed withsquamous cell carcinoma ndash a form of skin cancer ndash having previously been downgraded from urgent to routine.Another patient suffered a stroke after ldquofollow-up processes were not followed and had not started blood thinning treatment, while another patient died whilst on the cardiac surgery waiting list.In another serious incident, an eye disorder patientrsquos sight ldquodeteriorated signicantly after not being offered a follow-up appointment.A regulation  report ndash which is sent to organisations when a coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent further deaths ndash has also been sent to the health board since the end of November.The report relates to an inquest in which the coroner concluded that a patient died after taking a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication on an in-patient ward at University Hospital of Wales.The medication was not locked away in his bedside cupboard, which contravened the medicines code patient property policies, a health board report says.The health board report says: ldquoThe management of patientrsquos own medication is one which presents a particular challenge in the healthcare environment. Following the incident the UHB has carried out a benchmarking exercise across the UK and it does not appear that there is anyone centre that has managed to put an effective solution in place.ldquoWhile patients are always encouraged to hand over all medication or to send it home with family, there are many practical issues that make this dficult to implement and monitor robustly. Medication is the patientrsquos own property and they can refuse to hand it over should they wish. Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
