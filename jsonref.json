(Picture: Alexander Crawley)What I Rent is ’s weekly series that takes you inside people’s rentals in London.Because trying to find a place in London to rent can be hellish.It’s tricky to know how much is a ‘normal’ amount to be paying each month. Countless viewings make you start to genuinely consider living in a flat with a fold-out bed in the kitchen. Meanwhile, you see other people’s perfectly decorated homes on Instagram and wonder what on earth you’re doing wrong.There’s a lot of mystery and confusion when it comes to renting, which isn’t helped by estate agents’ very flattering photos of ‘cosy’ studio flats and the average renter’s reticence to openly chat about what they’re getting for how much they’re paying.**Either because they’re embarrassed by just how much they’re spending, or they don’t want to make us all feel bad because they have a bargain.To get rid of the mystery, we’re going inside different Londoners’ rented properties each week, for a look at all the bits landlords might not show you.This week we’re talking to Miranda and George, who live with their two cats, Chess and Cinder.They pay £1,283 per month, plus £170 in bills. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How much are you paying?Miranda: We pay roughly £1,283, plus £170 a month in bills. We’ve been trying to a more eco-friendly electricity provider but they keep screwing up the account.Bizarrely, this was the cheapest flat we could find and it’s in the nicest area we looked. Some es in North London are charging over £1,300 a month for what looks like a slightly spruced up slum.And what are you getting for that price?Miranda: It’s got three rooms and a balcony – a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan livingcookingdining space.It’s in Highgate, just down from Boogaloo. We’re not talking Highgate Village here (the ultra expensive, lush bit), but we were drinking in the same local as Jude Law last weekend….How long have you lived there?The flat has a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan living roomdining roomkitchen. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How did you find it?Miranda: We set off one day determined to not return to my parent’s house until we’d found a flat.We started in Camden and walked up here – stopping at every single estate agent. We were just about to give up and head back east when we spotted a tiny estate agent next to Highgate station, and this was the first property they showed us. We fell immediately in love.George: Through a lot of searching. For the price we’re paying and the areas we were looking at, it was quite a full on process and we missed out on a couple of places before finally finding this one. But I’d say this was the best of any we saw for the price.And do you like it?We’re perfectly positioned at the top of the hill between Archway, Muswell Hill, Crouch End and Highgate Village. It’s perfect for running (try running up the hill from Chalk Farm and you’ll soon get a sweat on), it’s leafy, it’s got great transport links and there are any number of bars and restaurants.Unfortunately, we moved here in November when it was dark and miserable and we were both on quite strict training regimes so we’re only just starting to get to know the area properly and take full advantage of all its features.It was the cheapest place the couple could find. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I’m learning to play tennis in the most beautiful park five minutes from the flat and as soon as the weather comes back, we’re off to start swimming in Hampstead Ponds.Oh, and it’s super quick to get to the Emirates which is a blessing given the number of mid week 7.45 kick off games!George: Yes, I’m very much happy with where we live. It’s quiet enough to escape a lot of hustle and bustle from the centre of London but has easy and quick access to virtually wherever we’d want to go.We’re still exploring the area having moved in relatively recently but there’s certainly a bit more of a suburban feel, which suits me as I’m not originally from here.Do you have enough space for both of you and the cats?Miranda: Yes, but we have a lot of crap – we’re both hoarders. You can never have enough space.George: Absolutely. The balcony really adds an extra dimension in the summer and catches the sun from that side but even when not using that in the warm weather, I’ve not felt cramped at all.The balcony is a definite highlight. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Are there any annoying bits about the place where you live?Miranda: At the start I couldn’t work out how to operate the heating and there’s a serious draft from the balcony (no double glazing). But now that it’s warmer, that draft is kind of a blessing.George: Not really. Again, not being from London, I’d say the price we’re paying is absolutely extortionate for what we’re getting (even though we do really like it) but that’s more of a general gripe with living in this ridiculously overpriced city, I guess…Any plans to move again?Miranda: Next year…but who’s to say what or where.George: I’d be happy to escape London ASAP but don’t have any immediate plans to go anywhere.Or who knows? I might even start saving some money elsewhere…And have you thought about buying a place?Miranda: I lived at home for so long with the express purpose of saving for my own place. I still haven’t given up hope although I’m starting to wonder if it wouldn’t be more expedient to just buy somewhere outside of London.My dad kept nagging me to buy somewhere in Barking a few years ago and I scoffed at him – why would I want a place even further out than my parents?Now, of course, they’re saying that Barking is THE place to invest and prices have already doubled. I’m a fool.Now, let’s have a nosy around Miranda and George’s place…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying. If you fancy taking part, please email whatirent@metro. You\u0027ll need to have pictures taken of your kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a few photos of you in your room. Make sure you get permission for your housemates!You\u0027ll also need to be okay with sharing how much you\u0027re paying for rent, as that\u0027s pretty important.

The risk does not appear to have been explained to them.‘They were henceforth treated as freelancers and not as staff so they got none of the benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, maternity leave, insurance or pension.’He told the court their contracts were essentially ‘no work, no pay’ and added Ms Gosling took unpaid maternity leave when pregnant with both her first and second children because her contract was ‘suspended’ by the broadcaster.Women like to watch other women being attacked, says...Share this articleThe BBC News Channel presenter, who was married to David Cameron’s former communications chief Sir Craig Oliver from 1996 to 2014, was told the broadcaster ‘would decide if and when it would have her back’.The court heard Ms Gosling, who has been with the broadcaster since 1999, was accidentally copied into an internal email which ‘put pressure on her’ to set up a PSC and said she would be given a job as producer rather than presenter at a lower fee if she refused.Meanwhile Mr Peacock told the court the BBC would not provide insurance for Mr Willcox when he reported from disaster zones, with the journalist covering major stories including the 2011 Japanese tsunami and the Chilean mining accident in 2010.Mr Peacock said: ‘If you are caught in a typhoon and you are injured you may hope the BBC send you a helicopter, but they have no obligation to do so.’          Ms Gosling joined the BBC in 1999 and the court heard she \u0027had to take unpaid maternity leave\u0027 when pregnantMs Gosling later moved to evening slots before taking the evening shift on the BBC News Channel from 2007 to 2013, and currently presents daytime slots.She has previously filled in on BBC Breakfast and has served as Friday presenter on the Victoria Derbyshire Programme on BBC2.Ms Gosling was married to David Cameron\u0027s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver between 1996 and 2014 and has three children with him.David Eades: Mr Eades has worked for the BBC in a variety of roles, having been with the broadcaster for decades.He was Channel Tunnel correspondent during its construction in the early 1990s and has also served as an Ireland and European correspondent.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB9972C00000578-0-Liam_Fox_pictured_on_Sky_News_today_has_accused_unelected_peers_-m-2_1525163260701.jpg","title":"Liam Fox accuses unelected peers trying block democratic people","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in Ulverston yesterday) today told her Cabinet today the House of Lords must not try to tie her hands in Brexit talks as she vowed a \u0027robust\u0027 response to a crushing defeat          Liam Fox (pictured on Sky News today) has accused unelected peers of trying to \u0027block the democratic will of the people\u0027 after the latest huge vote against Government Brexit plans          EU negotiator Michel Barnier is in Derry today (pictured) as he continues a tour of the Irish border The International Trade Secretary told Sky News: \u0027Now we have the unelected house actually trying to block the democratic will of the British people.\u0027This is a question about whether the will of the British people will be respected or not, and it must be.\u0027Asked by the BBC if Theresa May was now \u0027horribly weakened\u0027 he said: \u0027We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027That makes life harder.\u0027 Reviving plans for ID cards would prevent repeat of Windrush...Jacob Rees-Mogg rubbishes May\u0027s plans for a customs...GUY ADAMS: How an immigrant bus driver\u0027s son who survived a...Share this articleLast night\u0027s major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament radically strengthens the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal.Tabled by Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - it will remove the right of ministers to quit Brexit talks without a deal and hand the decision to Parliament instead.Later the Government suffered another defeat when peers voted 270 to 233 to back plans giving Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.             Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - said voters could not have made a final decision on Brexit without knowing the terms of the deal          He has secured support for a major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament that would radically strengthen the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal          Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum voteViscount Hailsham was joined in the lobby by 18 other Tory rebels including ex ministers Michael Heseltine, Ros Altmann and David Willetts.  Following last night\u0027s vote, Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said the Government was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and would now consider the implications of the vote.He said: \u0027What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the Government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both Houses a vote on the final deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed the vote as a crucial moment in the wrestle for control over Brexit between Parliament and ministers.He said: \u0027Labour won the argument at the end of last year for Parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU.

It\u0027s embarrassing to talk about, even now.\u0027The alleged encounters took place between September 2013 and May 2016 shortly after consultant Parthasarathy originally from Bangalore, India, was assigned to work at the hospital.          The doctor is alleged to have repeatedly grabbed the complainant\u0027s mobile phones out of their pockets to check if they had any \u0027rude pictures\u0027Colleague A, who is in her 40s, told the tribunal: \u0027It was a very busy afternoon and I was tending to a mother and her son as one had a minor injury. They were at one end of the room and I walked to the opposite side to document how I treated them and their medical history.\u0027I squatted down next to an empty bed and began documenting. But I felt Dr Parthasarathy come behind me and felt him touch the space between my legs, over the clothing. His hand went underneath me as I was squatting down.\u0027He touched me with one hand. I was wearing trousers and my green tunic top. I was aware the mother and her son were down the other end of the ward and I know that sort of behaviour wasn\u0027t acceptable and shouldn\u0027t be occurring in the A\u0026ampE department, so I didn\u0027t want to make a scene.\u0027I didn\u0027t say anything, I was in shock. After I finished what I was doing I left straight away, I just wanted to get out of there. I didn\u0027t want to be around him at the time. It was highly inappropriate.\u0027She added: \u0027He often tried to get my phone out of my pocket. He always asked if I had any rude pictures.\u0027After that I took six months off work on health grounds but I felt like nobody would believe me. It wasn\u0027t until May 2016 when Colleague B asked what I thought of him. We talked and she said she had similar experiences of him. She didn\u0027t look right, she looked upset and he was in the same shift as her.\u0027She told me about an incident a few days before. She told me he touched her bottom.\u0027       "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/20/4B776F8400000578-5674503-Making_friends_U_S_President_Donald_Trump_and_Mr_Netanyahu_meet_-a-54_1525116919271.jpg","title":"Iran brands Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu infamous liar nuke claims","story":"    Iran has branded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an \u0027infamous liar\u0027 after he claimed Tehran still has a top secret nuclear weapons programme. Netanyahu is pictured describing his claims on Monday          US President Donald Trump and Mr Netanyahu met in the Oval Office of the White House during the Israeli leader\u0027s visit to Washington last monthNetanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids.He claimed the material - some 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs of secret information Israeli Mossad operative obtained from a Tehran facility - shows Iran cannot be trusted and encouraged President Donald Trump to withdraw from the deal. Trump says the discovery vindicated his criticism of the deal.Last night US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Iranian documents  undercut the international nuclear deal it signed in 2015.Pompeo said in a statement he \u0027personally reviewed many of the Iranian files\u0027 and US experts consider the documents they have reviewed so far to be authentic.Tensions between Israel and Iran show us that once again the...British government says it has \u0027never been naive\u0027 about...Share this articleHe says that \u0027the documents show that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program for years\u0027 while it was denying it was pursuing such weapons.Pompeo says the Iranians lied to the six nations who negotiated the Iran nuclear deal. In his words, \u0027What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran\u0027s lies.\u0027 France said today that Netanyahu\u0027s claims reinforced the importance of the 2015 deal that imposes controls on the Islamic republic.\u0027The pertinence of the deal is reinforced by the details presented by Israel: all activity linked to the development of a nuclear weapon is permanently forbidden by the deal,\u0027 said a foreign ministry spokesperson. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027underlines the importance\u0027 of the controls imposed on Tehran three years ago.  Tehran, which has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons, dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s move as a \u0027ridiculous\u0027 show but did not address the documents produced by Netanyahu.Israeli minister Yoav Galant told Israel\u0027s Army Radio he suspected Trump was leaning toward nixing the deal, which would likely lead to a growing confrontation between Israel and Iran.           Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesBut he said Israel was prepared and doubted Iran would challenge Israel, given the humbling blow it was delivered.\u0027Anyone who saw the intelligence achievement can also understand what our military capabilities are,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that everyone around us will think long and hard before they try to harm Israel.\u0027Trump has signaled he will pull out of the agreement by May 12 unless it is revised, but he faces intense pressure from European allies not to do so. Israeli officials said the information it gathered had been shared in advance with the Americans, in an apparent hope of influencing Trump\u0027s decision.However, Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, delivered on live TV from Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, did not appear to provide evidence that Iran has violated the 2015 deal, raising questions about whether it would sway international opinion ahead of Trump\u0027s decision.          Netanyahu claimed the material - some 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs of secret information Israeli Mossad operative obtained from a Tehran facilityIran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show. The state-run IRNA news agency on Tuesday quoted Ghasemi as saying Netanyahu\u0027s speech was part of \u0027fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar.\u0027Israeli commentators lauded what was being described as one of the Mossad\u0027s greatest intelligence achievements in unmasking the true nature of the Iranian government\u0027s intent to the world. Still, there was disappointment over the lack of a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 proving Iran had violated the nuclear deal.Political opponents also bristled at Netanyahu\u0027s showmanship in presenting the find.\u0027I am convinced that an absolute majority of the intelligence and military officials were opposed to this presentation,\u0027 said Ram Ben-Barak, a former deputy Mossad director who currently belongs to the opposition Yesh Atid party.          Iran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show\u0027What was the point, apart from national pride, broadcasting it in such a dramatic way, as if you were unveiling a new and revolutionary telephone to the world,\u0027 he asked.The display ratcheted up already heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Tehran\u0027s hostile rhetoric, support for militants and growing influence in the region.Israel has said it will not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in neighboring Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar Assad. Just before midnight Sunday, a missile attack in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said.There was no official confirmation of the death toll or the target but Israel was widely suspected of being behind the attack.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/14/4BB941CB00000578-5677887-_Magical_feeling_A_man_is_silhouetted_by_the_dusk_light_as_he_wa-a-26_1525180961682.jpg","title":"Photographer captures hypnotising footage INSIDE waves","story":"    Stunning: The pictures are taken in various locations off the shores of southern California.

Tots TV was filmed in such a way that the floor was rarely shown on camera.           The dilapidated shell of the TV set is very different to its glory days, during the 1990s, with is rotting roof, broken windows and missing floorboards.\u0027This allowed for hatches to be built into the floor so that the puppeteers could hide below.\u0027I mainly had a sense of nostalgia when I saw the set. \u0027I remember watching Tots TV on VHS tapes when I was younger and I would never have thought that I would visit the filming location one day.           The three little friends also had a donkey and a rat for company and had a magic sack \u0027It was also sad to see it in this state, I have had many people comment on my video that feel the same way and have even called for it to be restored and turned into some sort of attraction.\u0027Producers won a number of awards including two BAFTAs.           The TV house was a genuine, approximately 13 of the size, cottage purposely built for the show in the woods on a farm in Stratford Upon Avon Tots TV first aired on January 4 1993 and finished on 27 April 1998 after more than 15 years entertaining British children on ITV.Tots TV was first broadcast on CITV and then was picked up by Public Service Broadcasting in the United States where the French speaking puppet changed to a Spanish speaking one. Those who watched it will remember that the three puppets who lived there had a pet donkey who was creatively named Donkey.           There are electrical wires connected to a roof which is covered in holes The TV show was written by two of its puppeteers and was hugely successful and syndicated around the world. In 2000 Discovery Kids bought the series and put it on television screens in Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Falkland Islands.Producers made special episodes of the series were produced for both and VHS release.They were so popular that they included a series of episodes set in the USA.The show which was called a \u0027Big Treasure Adventure\u0027 featured the puppets adventures on a pirate ship.            The now dilapidated shell home is in a terrible condition and has smashed windows and the doors are missing A number of Christmas specials, including one filmed in Rovaniemi, Finland, were also released to audiences to acclaim.Each of those shows were designed as educational video specials and went on sale in 1997.  The show may have ended 20 years ago but it is still on British TV thanks to BBC children\u0027s channel Cebeebies which broadcasts episodes on its internet platform.  Children loved the theme tune which was sang in the UK in both French and English and taught youngsters how to count in the language.          The staircase is broken and the fireplace is no longer in use in the once pretty little cottage The little puppets relied upon a magic sac or bag to help them through the narrative of the episodes.Designed for pre-school children the show also introduced youngsters to nature and a plethora of animals and aquatic life.          The outside is covered in moss and the walls are cracked as discarded flowers lay abandoned While nowhere to be seen in this photos the puppets also had help around their property from Jack the gardener who offered them a helping hand.Other episodes encouraged children to be active and even to undertake tasks \u0027super quickly\u0027.Among the other shows the Tots dressed up as pirates and went to a treasure island.           Electrical wires can still be seen in the shell home which hasn\u0027t been used for two decadesWhile music was also part of the narrative with the female puppet Tilly having a magical flute which she played to the other characters.The Tots also took trips out of their Warwickshire cottage and visited the seaside and in another popular episode visited an airport.           The cottage is completely unrecognisable from its original state and is wrecked inside and outThe characters also had access to a boat and often found fun things to do including games and meeting animal friends including Brian the cat. Each episode lasted for 20 minutes and a number of exciting adventures ensued including a visit to Loch Ness in Scotland where the trio went on the hunt for the world famous monster who has also appeared in other cartoons like Scooby Doo.          The inside of the cottage is dark and wrecked and is nothing like the colourful cottage  A total of 276 episodes of the popular television show were made before the show was eventually taken off air for a final time in 1998.The programme was eventually replaced by another Ragdoll puppet production in the year 2000. That show called Rosie and Jim featured little puppets who lived aboard a narrowboat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/11/4BB9DD5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1525170132724.jpg","title":"Tory candidate suspended claims Islamophobia","story":"    Tory council candidate David Boston has been suspended just days before local elections after posting a picture of bacon hanging on a door handle as a way to \u0027protect your house from terrorism\u0027          In response, the Enfield Conservatives posted on Facebook on April 16 that the posts did not reflect the values of the party and had been removed In response, the Enfield Conservatives posted on Facebook on April 16: \u0027The posts by David Boston are unacceptable and have been removed.

Deirdre claims the image was taken weeks after the massacre and proves Al wasn\u0027t behind it, otherwise the men wouldn\u0027t be so familiar with each-other\u0027So the police got upset that their livelihood was going to be cut off and that\u0027s who did it.\u0027 Witness accounts describe two men in police uniform entering the scene of the massacre – a garage at 2122 North Clark Street, Chicago – moments before it took place. However, the so-called officers are widely believed to have been mobsters in disguise, acting on the orders of Al Capone, who was then in his mansion in Miami.Moran himself was running late that morning and narrowly escaped the massacre, allegedly telling reporters afterward: \u0027Only Al Capone kills guys like that.\u0027 America\u0027s most notorious criminals in color: Al Capone, John...\u0027F**K KANYE UP\u0027: Rapper is flanked by bodyguards after...Share this articleDeirdre continued: \u0027Al\u0027s youngest brother, my uncle Matty, was with another gangster and they wanted to see what the pattern of Bugs going into the garage was. \u0027What they wanted to do was they wanted to go into the garage, talk to Bugs and just say there\u0027s enough business here for everybody, you don\u0027t have to act like this, just play by the rules. \u0027And of course my uncle told me this myself, he said Deirdre we were sitting in our car, and I saw this police car go up and down the street. \u0027It would go down the street – it was filled with policeman – and it would go back up the street.\u0027           The Saint Valnetine\u0027s Day Massacre saw seven members of the North Side Gang, rivals to Capone\u0027s Five Points Gang, lined up against this wall in Chicago and shot          The killings were carried out with two Thompson submachine guns and two shotguns, with each victim shot multiple times\u0027It wasn\u0027t really as bad as people are led to believe that it was back then, but yes there was bloodshed, of course there was.\u0027 The scene of the Saint Valentine\u0027s Day Massacre was demolished in 1967 and now provides parking for a nursing home. However the wall against which the victims were lined up and shot still survives, with bullet holes intact, at the Mob Museum in Las Vegas. Despite all of the publicity around the Valentine\u0027s Day Massacre, Deirdre said the first time she ever heard anything bad about her family was in 1947, when Capone died.She said: \u0027I was seven at the time and I was reading since the age of three, and all the newspapers all over the world were republishing all the things that they felt that the Capones had done.\u0027 Soon after, Deirdre\u0027s true identity was revealed to her schoolmates – they had known her as Deirdre Gabriel, the name her father, Ralph Capone Jr, had enrolled her with. \u0027I\u0027m a catholic girl, I was in Catholic school and Catholic children make their first communion in second grade,\u0027 she said. \u0027Sonnie, Al\u0027s son, and Sonnie\u0027s wife and girls… everybody came to church to watch me make my first communion and then we all went to Grandma Capone\u0027s house for a big picnic afterwards.           Capone was jailed in 1931 for tax evasion and served eight years before being released with syphilitic dementia. He died of a cardiac arrest in Florida in 1947\u0027Well back in those days there was always local editions of the big Chicago papers. \u0027So on Monday the local edition of the Tribune and the local edition of the Chicago American ran a story that said the children at St Philip Neri Church made their first communion, and Deirdre Capone – with the entire Capone family in attendance – made hers. \u0027They didn\u0027t know me as Deirdre Capone, they knew me as Deirdre Gabriel. But how many Deirdres do you think were in the city of Chicago, let alone this little school with 30 students? \u0027They knew. Two weeks after we made our first communion, every boy and every girl in my second-grade class was invited to this girl\u0027s birthday party, but not me. \u0027I would have a birthday party and nobody would come.\u0027 Her name also cost Deirdre her first job, working for an insurance company. She said: \u0027After you had worked for this insurance company for six months you got a free life insurance policy and so I had to fill that application out in my legal name – I had to use Capone. \u0027So two weeks after I made this application out, my boss called me into his office and sat me down and he says what is your name? And I knew something was up. \u0027I said Deirdre Gabriel and he said no, what is your real name? And I said Deirdre Capone. \u0027He said are you any relation to Al Capone? And I said, yes, he was my uncle. He said, you can\u0027t work here, you\u0027re fired. \u0027The outfit at that time was laundering their money and they would put it into insurance companies, into car dealerships and into restaurants. \u0027This insurance company couldn\u0027t take the chance that their investors would think that it was mob money that was going into this company, so they had to fire me. \u0027But it hurt. I mean, it was just one more thing.\u0027 Deirdre would later move to Minnesota, where she kept her Capone identity hidden from everybody except her husband, Bob. Even her own children only found out about their heritage after telling their parents they were learning about Al Capone at school. \u0027It was like somebody took a sledgehammer and hit me across the belly with it,\u0027 said Deirdre. \u0027I almost fainted. \u0027And so I went to my husband and I said \u0027honey, we\u0027re going to have to tell the children their heritage before they find out about it from somebody else.\u0027 \u0027I said, kids, I\u0027ve got something to tell you. I said, I was born Deirdre Marie Capone – Al Capone was my uncle. \u0027I have four children and the children looked at me, they looked at each other, and then they looked back at me and – this is the gospel truth – in unison they said cool mom.\u0027 Deirdre says she wrote her book to give a new perspective on the Capone family.\u0027There\u0027s no one left in the family that knew Al Capone, except me,\u0027 she said. \u0027So I have got to do it.\u0027Uncle Al Capone: The Untold Story from Inside His Family is available now from Recaplodge "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/16/4BBC813D00000578-5678723-Raffle_organisers_have_to_sell_150_000_tickets_to_ensure_the_dea-a-25_1525189825086.jpg","title":"Travel firm owner treated staff Marbella holiday sends two employees abroad","story":"    Ian Lucas, centre, decided he wanted to congratulate personal assistant Sadie Ball (left) and sales manager Viki Baines (right) for their \u0027hard work\u0027 and \u0027dedication\u0027          In July last year the entire team enjoyed a three day trip to Marbella in the Costa del SolHe said: \u0027Sadie and Viki are both incredibly loyal and valued members of the Red7 family. \u0027Red7 has been working and playing hard for 21 years now and it\u0027s our fantastic staff that have made this possible.\u0027Both these amazing staff members have given Red7 10 years of hard work and dedication.

There were 239 people aboard. No transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight, but it is believed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean based on the drift patterns of crash debris that washed ashore on distant beaches.The governments of Malaysia, China and Australia called off the nearly three-year official search in January 2017. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau\u0027s final report on the search conceded authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the plane\u0027s disappearance or its exact location.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB960A700000578-0-image-m-54_1525162161765.jpg","title":"Liam Fox accuses unelected peers trying block democratic people","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in Ulverston yesterday) today told her Cabinet today the House of Lords must not try to tie her hands in Brexit talks as she vowed a \u0027robust\u0027 response to a crushing defeat          Liam Fox (pictured on Sky News today) has accused unelected peers of trying to \u0027block the democratic will of the people\u0027 after the latest huge vote against Government Brexit plans          EU negotiator Michel Barnier is in Derry today (pictured) as he continues a tour of the Irish border The International Trade Secretary told Sky News: \u0027Now we have the unelected house actually trying to block the democratic will of the British people.\u0027This is a question about whether the will of the British people will be respected or not, and it must be.\u0027Asked by the BBC if Theresa May was now \u0027horribly weakened\u0027 he said: \u0027We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027That makes life harder.\u0027 Reviving plans for ID cards would prevent repeat of Windrush...Jacob Rees-Mogg rubbishes May\u0027s plans for a customs...GUY ADAMS: How an immigrant bus driver\u0027s son who survived a...Share this articleLast night\u0027s major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament radically strengthens the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal.Tabled by Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - it will remove the right of ministers to quit Brexit talks without a deal and hand the decision to Parliament instead.Later the Government suffered another defeat when peers voted 270 to 233 to back plans giving Parliament a say on Britain\u0027s mandate for Brexit talks.             Viscount Hailsham - better known as the former MP Douglas Hogg, infamous for expense claims to clean his moat - said voters could not have made a final decision on Brexit without knowing the terms of the deal          He has secured support for a major amendment to the flagship Brexit laws going through Parliament that would radically strengthen the so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on the final deal          Former Tory leader Lord Michael Howard told the Lords the rebel amendment demonstrated the \u0027appalling lengths\u0027 Remain backers would go to frustrate the referendum voteViscount Hailsham was joined in the lobby by 18 other Tory rebels including ex ministers Michael Heseltine, Ros Altmann and David Willetts.  Following last night\u0027s vote, Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said the Government was \u0027disappointed\u0027 and would now consider the implications of the vote.He said: \u0027What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving Parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the Government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.\u0027It is absolutely right that Parliament is able to scrutinise the final deal, and that is why we have already committed to giving both Houses a vote on the final deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hailed the vote as a crucial moment in the wrestle for control over Brexit between Parliament and ministers.He said: \u0027Labour won the argument at the end of last year for Parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU.

In his words, \u0027What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran\u0027s lies.\u0027 France said today that Netanyahu\u0027s claims reinforced the importance of the 2015 deal that imposes controls on the Islamic republic.\u0027The pertinence of the deal is reinforced by the details presented by Israel: all activity linked to the development of a nuclear weapon is permanently forbidden by the deal,\u0027 said a foreign ministry spokesperson. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027underlines the importance\u0027 of the controls imposed on Tehran three years ago.  Tehran, which has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons, dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s move as a \u0027ridiculous\u0027 show but did not address the documents produced by Netanyahu.Israeli minister Yoav Galant told Israel\u0027s Army Radio he suspected Trump was leaning toward nixing the deal, which would likely lead to a growing confrontation between Israel and Iran.           Netanyahu\u0027s speech was delivered in English and relied on his trademark use of visual aids          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesBut he said Israel was prepared and doubted Iran would challenge Israel, given the humbling blow it was delivered.\u0027Anyone who saw the intelligence achievement can also understand what our military capabilities are,\u0027 he said. \u0027I assume that everyone around us will think long and hard before they try to harm Israel.\u0027Trump has signaled he will pull out of the agreement by May 12 unless it is revised, but he faces intense pressure from European allies not to do so. Israeli officials said the information it gathered had been shared in advance with the Americans, in an apparent hope of influencing Trump\u0027s decision.However, Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, delivered on live TV from Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, did not appear to provide evidence that Iran has violated the 2015 deal, raising questions about whether it would sway international opinion ahead of Trump\u0027s decision.          Netanyahu claimed the material - some 55,000 pages of documents and 183 CDs of secret information Israeli Mossad operative obtained from a Tehran facilityIran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show. The state-run IRNA news agency on Tuesday quoted Ghasemi as saying Netanyahu\u0027s speech was part of \u0027fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar.\u0027Israeli commentators lauded what was being described as one of the Mossad\u0027s greatest intelligence achievements in unmasking the true nature of the Iranian government\u0027s intent to the world. Still, there was disappointment over the lack of a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 proving Iran had violated the nuclear deal.Political opponents also bristled at Netanyahu\u0027s showmanship in presenting the find.\u0027I am convinced that an absolute majority of the intelligence and military officials were opposed to this presentation,\u0027 said Ram Ben-Barak, a former deputy Mossad director who currently belongs to the opposition Yesh Atid party.          Iran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman called Netanyahu\u0027s performance a \u0027threadbare charlatanism\u0027 show\u0027What was the point, apart from national pride, broadcasting it in such a dramatic way, as if you were unveiling a new and revolutionary telephone to the world,\u0027 he asked.The display ratcheted up already heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Tehran\u0027s hostile rhetoric, support for militants and growing influence in the region.Israel has said it will not allow Iran to establish a permanent military presence in neighboring Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar Assad. Just before midnight Sunday, a missile attack in northern Syria killed more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians, a war monitoring group and an Iranian news agency said.There was no official confirmation of the death toll or the target but Israel was widely suspected of being behind the attack.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/14/4BB941CB00000578-5677887-_Magical_feeling_A_man_is_silhouetted_by_the_dusk_light_as_he_wa-a-26_1525180961682.jpg","title":"Photographer captures hypnotising footage INSIDE waves","story":"    Stunning: The pictures are taken in various locations off the shores of southern California.

They have become much more sophisticated in terms of what they are buying, seeking out these rare Imperial treasures.\u0027The auction takes place on May 21 and the bowl has been given an estimate of £100,000 to £200,000. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/11/4BBB3B7900000578-0-image-a-17_1525171123799.jpg","title":"Doctors lawyers teachers likely drink alcohol manual workers","story":"    Nearly 70 per cent of people with managerial and professional jobs had consumed alcohol over the past week, according to an ONS surveyThe figures emerged as Scotland became the first country in the world to implement a minimum unit price for alcohol. England has the highest proportion of adult drinkers, according to the ONS research.In England, 57.8 per cent of adults reported having a drink in the previous week compared with 53.5 per cent in Scotland and 50 per cent in Wales.Scotland alcohol price rise LIVE: Beer and cider costs soar...Get set for the North of England booze cruise!

Britain is one of McDonald’s strongest markets, reporting 12 years of quarterly growth.While the numbers of employees taking strike action on Tuesday is small – just 11 are officially involved – one academic said the move was significant. Tony Royle, a professor of employment relations at the University of York, said the dispute was symbolic of the growing income gap, an increase in precarious work and a decline in independent trade union representation.“McDonald’s is a multibillion-dollar corporation which continues to pay its senior executives sky-high salaries while paying low wages for the vast majority of its 2 million employees.“Young workers in particular have felt the brunt of the ‘flexible’ labour market and austerity government policies and are increasingly frustrated, angry and ready to fight for a more just workplace.A McDonald’s spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon that only one person had walked out across three strikes planned for the morning, while a maximum of of five people could walk out across the other two due to take place this afternoon.“The vast majority of our employees - across all stores, franchised and company-owned - received the annual pay rise in January, and the increase referred to within your piece started back in 2015.“Union recognition did not feature on the ballot paper, there is no suggestion this strike is calling for McDonald’s to recognise the union.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has written to McDonald’s calling for a meeting to discuss the union’s demands.McDonald’s owns or franchises more than 37,000 restaurants in 120 countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ee09576ff976de254c6d5c79484e7bdeec8a47/0_0_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88c683a8188b0829700e6289c59be3b3","title":"rbs to close 162 branches with loss of 800 jobs","story":"New closures in England and Wales prompt fresh concerns for rural communities and small businessesRoyal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch.The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams \u0026amp Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale – which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer.The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 branches will close in July and August and 53 will shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant.The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs.After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. She said: “In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. “As a result of RBS’s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It’s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.”The Unite union called on RBS to halt its “disastrous plans”. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “The TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.”RBS said that the majority of branches slated for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, and insisted that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch.Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to £792m.The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a new specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology.The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets.The FSB’s national chairman, Mike Cherry, said: “It’s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams \u0026amp Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK’s bank branch network.“This fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result.He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. “Many small business owners have built up relationships with branch personnel that go back years – that’s not something that can be replaced by an app.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4e5382b7290976c3ae5d88d1b274db2e3fbe8d/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eebab566b8284eba328baeca702726bc","title":"unexpected beauty china bicycle graveyards share bikes in pictures","story":"For the past 18 months many cities in China have been flooded by millions of dockless share bikes.

Labour embraced migrants … the Tories, not so much … Things are changing,” said one young black Tory in safer times, in 2015.Most of the black Tories I know are of African heritage and were raised with values that emphasise enterprise, faith, family and social conservatism. (For me, the conundrum has never been why there are black Conservatives at all, but why there aren’t more.) They have adopted a worldview in which racism – both within British society and the Tory party in particular – is largely a thing of the past. This has enabled them to create a mental ide between the party’s social and economic values, which they like, and its dodgy history on race. Their emphasis has been on personal responsibility and enterprise, rather than structural barriers to advancement.The last two Conservative prime ministers both made bold statements about their commitments toward eradicating these barriers. David Cameron, branding it “disgraceful” that a young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she was invited to job interviews, for example and Theresa May, in her stance on stop and search, and the launch of her race audit.But the struggle to reconcile those warm words with the Windrush scandal has, perhaps not surprisingly, sent my black Tory acquaintances into a bout of soul-searching. “Better inside the tent looking out than outside the tent looking in,” one – a successful banker – told me. He then, somewhat mournfully, sent me the  article that Margaret Thatcher’s former speechwriter Derek Laud wrote on why the treatment of the Windrush generation made him glad he had left the party. Another black Tory told me, as if trying to convince herself: “Imagine how much worse it would be if there were no black people in the party.”I can’t imagine that, actually. How much worse could it be? We have a foreign secretary who has a long and distinguished track record of the crudest racist remarks – and the comments he published as editor of the Spectator about Caribbean people “multiplying like flies” are particularly painful to read in the light of current events. We have a litany of racist comments by activists, councillors and MPs. The last Conservative London mayoral campaign was so toxic that other Tories sought to distance themselves from it. And even when alerted to the Windrush injustices, May’s instinct was not to meet Caribbean leaders.Yes, there has been racism in the Labour party too, and it is currently – as has been widely reported – battling antisemitism in its ranks. The left has had a lazy\u0026nbsptendency to caricature black Tories as sellouts, while enjoying a historical sense of entitlement towards\u0026nbspthe black vote – an attitude that has its own imperialist connotations.Yet on the right there is a tendency to manipulate black conservatism to paper over a history of appalling racism and discrimination. Even the most conservative Conservatives have shocking stories of treatment within their own party, both at national and local level. Most do not speak about them publicly, although the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi’s rare account of the prejudice she experienced as a Muslim in the party is sobering. When a young black man close to me went to enquire about local party membership not long ago, they assumed he was there to deliver their pizza.But politics should be about policy, not the behaviour of rogue bigots, who can be found on all sides of the political spectrum. And that’s why the Conservative track record on immigration is so hard to reconcile. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, for example, has a well-known backstory, beloved by Conservatives, of hard-earned success after his father’s arrival in the UK with just £1 to his name. Yet this story could not happen today, because Javid’s own party would not let his father into the country.The families of the MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Sam Gyimah and Adam Afriyie, one or both of whose parents came, as my mother did, from Ghana having been British subjects under the empire, would – had they achieved the unlikely feat of making it into the country under today’s immigration policies – have found themselves in the nightmare of the Tories’ own hostile environment.It’s this hypocrisy that black Conservatives, on both sides of the Atlantic, struggle to shake off. The conviction of Bill Cosby for aggravated indecent assault against one woman – though he has more than 50 accusers – is bitter justice for a man whose message was, “Do as I say, not as I do”. Cosby, like black British Tories, blamed absent black fathers, shameless single mothers, black culture and rap music – not structural racism and injustice – for America’s creation of a black underclass. Substitute Cosby’s critique of “rap” for British Tories’ critique of “grime” and it all sounds very familiar.In the House of Commons on his first day in his new role, Javid told his shadow, Diane Abbott, that she did not have a “monopoly” on either being the descendant of migrants, or feeling anger and pain at the way some have been treated. And he’s right. But his party is fast earning itself a reputation for having a monopoly over treating British people of colour as less than British, indeed as less than human. And that will reverberate not just among people like me, who already fundamentally distrust the Tories, but many black and brown Brits who once did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf05803860323a53bc9cf147836a14c452c53ff/1369_437_3885_2330/master/3885.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bea49bbd929b0155a2503f51302c1522","title":"sainsburys singing ceo supermarket merger asda","story":"You only sing when you’re winning. That is one explanation for the unguarded moment when Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, started trotting out the words to We’re In the Money while waiting for his next interview on the proposed £12bn Asda deal to begin. “To attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous,” a spokesman for Sainsbury’s said. Who could resist a challenge like that?Investors get excited about these deals because of what they call “synergies”, which is to say cost-savings, which is to say job losses. So for the boss to be singing about being in the money while thousands of employees – and suppliers – were experiencing a nasty dig in the ribs and a swift knee to the bank account was tactless, to say the least. “It was an unfortunate choice,” Coupe admitted. In the circumstances, even Happy Days Are Here Again might have been a better option.It could have been worse, though. Coupe could have moved on to the next bit of the song:We never see a headline’Bout a breadline, today,And when we see the landlord,We can look that guy right in the eye.These are not words to gladden the heart of Generation Rent.Those words again – you’ve got to keep dancing – we have heard them before. But when? It was in July 2007, when Chuck Prince, then CEO of Citibank, was also interviewed by the FT. “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated,” he said back then. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” And then the music stopped. The system crashed. And people are still suffering the consequences.It is sometimes said that “the market has no memory”. This looks like confirmation. Whether LeBrun is deliberately quoting Prince or is doing so unconsciously is not clear. But the message is the same. Turn the music up, keep making as much money as possible as quickly as possible – look at all those happy Sainsbury’s shareholders! – and when it goes wrong again (“exogenous shock”) the bailouts will come and we can all start over. Yes, public finances may take another hit, with implications for taxpayers and public services, but what the hell! Party on.I have just handed over to my successor, Luke Hildyard, after two and a half years as director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank. I have been buried in the world of excessive CEO pay for a while. And sometimes it feels as if the masters of the universe have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. There has been progress. The compulsory publication of the pay ratio between the boss and the average worker will start to exert some pressure on boards and CEOs to exercise a bit of restraint. What is still clearly missing in this high pay world is the voice of employees themselves. Their representatives should be in the room when top pay is being discussed. This would add more downward pressure, and perhaps start to deal with the glaring inequality that has driven ugly populism around the world. Taxing those companies with excessive pay gaps more heavily, as is beginning to happen in the US, may calm things further.But back to our singing Sainsbury’s CEO. Nobody seems to have noticed, but after the “we’re in the money” riff Coupe added a little “do do dah do do, dah do dah, dah do dah do” line – which sounds an awful lot like the “This is the self-preservation society” bit from the film The Italian Job. It’s the song that plays as the bank robbers drive away from Turin with their coachload of stolen gold. But to repeat: to attach any wider meaning to this innocent, personal moment is preposterous.• Stefan Stern is the co-author of Myths of Management and a former director of the High Pay Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f656fae098bdac81e75f7c80f7099339d1a95b4f/0_20_630_378/master/630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ba54fc11dc9840bccaec13b6c87584d","title":"tories latest campaign tactic blaming labour hepatitis","story":"A Tory local election leaflet claimed that Labour was responsible for ‘delivering’ hepatitis in the area. Can this party get any more farcical?I’m aware this could be considered a discordant view, but – bear with me – I am impressed with the Conservative party. Very impressed. I have never known a party – and this includes the college parties where an earnest guy whips out an acoustic guitar or the sixth-form party where someone loses their virginity in a garage on a cobwebbed camping mat or the primary school party in which the ritualised anxiety that is musical chairs lasts for 45 minutes – that is so unrelentingly, unquestionably awful.Since the 2017 election (and let’s not dwell on that campaign, because there’s way too much fodder to take the piss out of), the government has lost five members of its cabinet. I fully got bored assembling a cabinet in my new flat, decided 10 screws would be fine rather than the mandated 18 (madness), and that cabinet has still held longer than this government’s front bench.Then there’s the institutional racism of the Home Office’s hostile environment policy (architect: one Theresa May), where British citizens have had to pay through the nose to apply for citizenship they already hold, but foreign oligarchs are fast-tracked for citizenship if they cough up what amounts to little of their net worth. We have a liability for a foreign secretary a circus of clowns for a Brexit committee and a bunch of opaque policies always outlined by the PM with “let me be clear”. But we have now reached peak theatre of the absurd.In the run-up to Thursday’s local elections, a leaflet was produced on behalf of Kamran Razzaq, a prospective Tory councillor for Dudley council, which blames Labour for … hepatitis. Actual hepatitis. The precise wording is that Labour has “delivered” hepatitis. Please, if you could, imagine a stork carrying an often symptomless STI. The other thing Labour has delivered is “decline of our area”, which is so vague as to be meaningless, and is also a description of everyone’s personal grooming atrophy in winter.Razzaq is a former member of the hepatitis-spreading Labour party who made the switch to the Tories, a disease of its own kind, which doesn’t usually take hold until middle-age. But there is more gold to be gleaned from the leaflet. Including that Razzaq is “fighting for our commnunity”. COMMNUNITY. Hey, who loved that show, COMMNUNITY? Who doesn’t love a feel-good commnunity spirit? There is also shade thrown at Ukip, for the apparent sin of installing defibrillators. Defibrillators are an unquestionable good thing, given that their public installations frequently save the lives of members of the public having a cardiac arrest. But Razzaq isn’t having any of it. But, returning to hepatitis, as I think we’ve all been keen to do: there is actually a context here. There has indeed been an outbreak of hepatitis A in the Cradley and Wollescote ward (the ward Razzaq is standing for, there are 24 in total), as the Stourbridge News reported. But it’s not concocted by Labour. It is in fact down to pockets of poverty and poor sanitation, with one example being the utterly depressing fact that 25 people were found to be using a single toilet. Now, this would have been a salient point for Razzaq to make. Although what with the Tories’ lust for austerity, 25 people to a single toilet looks a little too much like luxury living. Who can really rule out the possibility that the Tories’ next move wouldn’t be to replace that toilet with a chamber pot and a single roll of loo paper? Anyway, I would say good luck to Razzaq, the Superman to hepatitis’ Lex Luthor. But after Christian Calgie, a Conservative parliamentary aide, brought the leaflet to widespread attention on Twitter, because he was embarrassed, Razzaq has been suspended and an investigation opened. Razzaq is yet to comment, but it’s possible he was too busy booing people entering a local GUM clinic. Pete Lowe, the local Labour leader, told HuffPost that the leaflet was “the most bizarre I have seen in my 30 years in politics”. He stopped there, after commenting: “words fail me”. As far as we know, that’s not a sign of hepatitis.

Here, we pick some of the best – from souks to starry hauntsAbu Dhabi is a city of extremes, and we’re not just talking about that summer heat. The expensive tastes of wealthy locals and expats have seen it become a magnet for the biggest global names in hospitality, but if that’s not your scene, there’s also quite a selection of less overdraft-bothering local cafes that can offer astonishing value for money. From the ultra-shiny to the super-simple, here’s our pick of the best ...Liwan MansourLebanese is by far the UAE’s favourite cuisine, and despite the efforts of the capital’s top hotels, the best hummus and tabbouleh is still to be found in less polished surrounds. Most of the dishes here are simply on a par with nearby contenders, but it’s the takeaway shawarma – stuffed with beef or chicken, fries and garlic sauce – that make it a must for street-food seekers. Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates. Looking to redress the balance is Shaikha Al Kaabi, a young local who first set up a roving foodtruck serving modern takes on the dishes of her childhood, and has since opened a bricks-and-mortar site. Start with the fareed (a meat and veg stew), before graduating to harees (a wheat pudding with beef). Even if one plate isn’t to your taste, dishes start at AED 20 (£4), so risks are minimal.meylasenBonna AnneeAs is tradition in Ethiopian cuisine, dishes at this welcoming backstreet restaurant come served up on a spongy sourdough flatbread called injera. This edible plate also serves as cutlery – rip a patch off and use it to scoop up the slow-cooked stews and curries on top. The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE. But Hakkasan – one of the first to do so – is unique in that it’s still every bit as good as it was when it first arrived at Emirates Palace eight years ago. The menu of modern Cantonese dishes is big on luxe ingredients – think Canadian lobster, Alaskan crab and wagyu beef – but the delicate, stunningly beautiful dim sum is where the kitchen’s real craft lies.hakkasanlocationshakkasan-abu-dhabiButcher \u0026amp StillThe Four Seasons hotel brought a whole new level of luxury to the city when it opened in 2016, so it’s no surprise to find that its flagship restaurant – a 1920s-styled steakhouse – is one of the hottest tables in town.

The Frenchman is contracted to 2019 with an option for a further year, and would therefore command a considerable fee. Juve are understood to have indicated they would be prepared to pay around £45m for his services.Chelsea, braced for Real Madrid to firm up their long-standing interest in Eden Hazard, would consider the 22-year-old a player of considerable potential, but also one with the quality already to feature anywhere across their front line. United’s instinct will be to retain the forward, who they secured from Monaco for an initial £36m in 2015, but, if Martial pushes for a move, they may not be averse to selling, even to a isional rival. The clubs negotiated Nemanja Matic’s move to Old Trafford last summer, and José Mourinho retains an interest in the Chelsea forward, Willian.Roman Abramovich is still hopeful Hazard will sign a new contract but is eager to instigate other changes to the playing staff at Stamford Bridge this summer, when Antonio Conte is expected to depart. Despite the uncertainty over the identity of the Italian’s successor, the club’s recruitment department – still operating without a technical director – have already begun exploring the market for potential additions, though Chelsea would have to generate funds through sales.A failure to qualify for the Champions League – they are fifth, now five points behind Tottenham with three games to play – would result in a shortfall of up to £70m in revenues and, in order to satisfy Financial Fair Play rules, fringe players may be moved on. Borussia Dortmund may seek to make Michy Batshuayi’s loan move a permanent deal after the Belgian impressed in the Bundesliga with seven goals in nine starts prior to an ankle injury. Kurt Zouma and Kenedy, currently on loan at Stoke and Newcastle respectively, could also move on, while Tomas Kalas and Lucas Piazon could join Fulham permanently if Slavisa Jokanovic’s side are promoted to the top flight.The England internationals Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is expected to be in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the summer’s World Cup finals, and Tammy Abraham will not be sold, but the likes of Marco van Ginkel and even Danny Drinkwater, who has endured a frustrating first season at the club since arriving from Leicester for £35m, could also depart. David Luiz, under-used all season, may consider the changes in the dugout before confronting his own future at the club.Chelsea boast a net outlay of around £119m since 2014 with their business model having shifted markedly from the lavish spending of the early Abramovich era. The oligarch remains as committed as ever, with the club committed to redeveloping Stamford Bridge, but will continue to comply with FFP, meaning they will not boast the leeway enjoyed by Manchester City and United in the market.Abramovich is to be honoured by the Federation of Jewish communities of Russia, whose board of trustees he chairs, for investing in excess of £360m into Jewish communities in Russia, Israel and other countries around the world. “Much of the work we do has been made possible thanks to Mr Abramovich, and we are deeply thankful for his continued support,” said the FJCR president, Rabbi Alexander Boroda.“We have more than 160 communities in all of Russia and Roman supports them all. He never talks about it, but I want to because people don’t understand who is the source of it is – and it is him.” Chelsea have run a prominent ‘Say No to Antisemitism’ campaign, personally initiated by the owner, since February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bda80adea1aa7240e1de6aad5d158d02b50a9b/0_125_3068_1841/master/3068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4647aa4a48d3806bdb4a0f425c93b2a","title":"roma liverpool believe champions league vincent candela","story":"In the last few days the city has been trembling with excitement. No one speaks about anything else: there is only Roma v Liverpool, in the bars and in the restaurants, among friends or on the metro. It will be a great celebration of sport with an extraordinary atmosphere: trust me, the Olimpico will be an inferno.For Roma it is only their second time in a European Cup semi-final, and therefore something historic: the climate inside the stadium will be even hotter and even more fiery than what we saw against Barcelona.Roma are famous around the world for their fans: they have passion, love and heart. I witnessed it and it was something wonderful. Against Liverpool you will see the same total support for the team: the stadium will be completely clad in red and yellow, the fans will sing for 90 minutes and then it is up to the team to do the business.The Roma fans are amazing. Even today, 15 years later, they stop when they see me and start to sing the song they sang about me when I was playing: it is incredible. They stop me everywhere, even at restaurants when I am out eating.They still salute me every day. They were the first fans to make a banner saying “I love you” to a team in the 80s and there is an incredible passion for the players who play for the team.The players are also fans of the team so there is total love between the supporters and the players and you will see the result of that against Liverpool on Wednesday night.Everyone here believes that Roma can get through, just as they should. The two late goals at Anfield have given everyone hope and I believe too. They have to play the perfect game, just like they did against Barcelona because Liverpool are better than Barça in my opinion. If everything goes our way then Roma can do it. In the capital everyone is hoping and believing.Liverpool, of course, have a former Roma player in their team, Mohamed Salah, and he will get a great reception. He did so well in the Roma shirt and got close to the fans. He had to leave because of finances and he will be greeted like a champion on his return to the club. In the Premier League, with Liverpool, he has taken another step forward: here in Italy he played a bit deeper and did not score as many goals.As far as I am concerned he can win the Ballon d’Or: he is a fantastic player and it will all come down to who wins the Champions League. If he does that, then the Ballon d’Or could well go to Momo.As far as the home team is concerned I think Daniele De Rossi could be decisive. He is the heart of this Roma side and a romanista, the fans’ hero. Against Barcelona he had an amazing assist and also scored from the penalty spot to make people believe the amazing comeback was on. One additional thing with him is that he can animate the fans at the Olimpico. Then we shouldn’t forget about Edin Dzeko, of course.I have played at Anfield against Liverpool and that is an experience that is impossible to forget. The fans sing for 90 minutes and they are extraordinary. I brought my kids because you have to live that experience.At the Olimpico the fans are further away but the Roma supporters are just as good as the Liverpool ones. You will see the colours, how much heart they put into it and the choreography of the tifo to help the team. The Olimpico will be an extraordinary sight for this incredible night of Champions League football.Vincent Candela played for Roma between 1997 and 2005 and won the club’s third Scudetto in their history in 2001.

The building was so badly damaged after Hurricane Maria that the electricity didn’t work, and water no longer ran from the taps. With nowhere for the mothers and their children to go, she decided to wait until the new year before closing the door. Shortly before Christmas, local people donated one week’s worth of fuel for the generator.“Christmas is a big deal in Puerto Rico,” says Gloria, who works for the charity Casa de la Bondad. “And so the children decorated the tree, and put lights on it, and then for a few hours each night they lit them up using the generator.”Seven months after the hurricane, all that remains here is the Christmas tree and old boxes of dry food. The entrance is still blocked by piles of rubble, and the water and power are still down. Across Puerto Rico, at least 150,000 people are still without electricity. And a new hurricane season looms in just a few month.As a US territory, an estimated 135,000 people have left Puerto Rico for the mainland. The remaining island residents rely on community efforts and aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US body responsible for disaster response, to try to rebuild. But Gloria faces a different problem. Although the shelter was forced to close down because of hurricane damage, Fema only offers loans to businesses and organisations for hurricane damage, not aid. This means women’s shelters and charitable organisations that cannot afford loans and repairs, and suffered damage when the hurricane struck, are at risk of closure if they cannot find donations. “That just wasn’t a realistic option for us,” Gloria says.Myra Lespier Cruz, a mother of two, is among those benefitting from the support of the few women’s services still operating on the island, such as mental health support and resources for survivors of sexual violence. She still suffers shock from the hurricane, and says it exacerbated her health issues. She believes she would have died without their help. “We were hungry, and they were the ones who gave me food. I went a month without medicine for my anxiety, but they were the ones who helped me,” she says.Myra recalls President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico. At the time, he spoke of a death toll then estimated at 64. But subsequent media reports and estimations suggest the true number is probably more than 1,000, partly as a result of ongoing trauma caused by the hurricane, including a huge rise in suicide rates.“I remember him saying around 60 people were dead, and I thought, ‘Well, that’s not true.’ There are people I know still dying from having no electricity, people who need medical machines in hospitals.“I felt a lot of rage and frustration about that. We are American citizens too, but why don’t they help us? They’re killing us. They don’t care about our lives.”Gloria and other charities are fighting to have Fema protocols changed to help people like Myra. Earlier this year, they met with the agency to discuss putting arrangements in place to provide them with aid, not loans, if another hurricane hits. In the meantime, Gloria wants to reopen the shelter in the coming months, regardless of the lack of electricity, because of the urgent need for shelters for women who need to leave abusive partners. The Christmas tree that still stands in the shelter, she says, was one of the few reminders of normality the women and children once had. “I hope by the end of this year, we can light up the tree without needing to rely on a generator.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3549b3318c46b99df64bf3b39da88226793a71/0_115_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848dd5a33abde27e787afa6fddbd99e4","title":"from glossies to gal dem the websites revolutionising womens media","story":"Frustrated about the narrow, stereotyped world of magazines supposedly aimed at them, a group of female journalists have moved online to tackle politics, social justice and identityOver the past decade, the women’s magazine has undergone a radical makeover. While 00s glossies consisted largely of insidious bodyshaming and bankrupting shoe recommendations, in recent years female-centric journalism has migrated online, simultaneously shifting its gaze to social justice, mental health and the hitherto hidden realities of womanhood. It has not always been a smooth transition: last week, the online women’s magazine the Debrief announced its closure, with its parent company, Bauer Media, deciding to refocus resources into its print product Grazia. Last year, Sarah Millican’s Standard Issue shut, while US website the Hairpin followed suit in January. Yet a host of other publications remain committed to doing things differently. Here, the women behind London-based site gal-dem and Mille World, an online magazine aimed at Arab readers, explain why they are determined to reimagine the women’s magazine as a force for positive change. RASofia Guellaty launched Mille World out of frustration that it did not already exist. She was looking for a publication that engaged with what it meant to be a young Arab woman. Versace, Dior, Calvin Klein and Chanel were sending hijabs down their runways, but who was catering to the savvy, cosmopolitan Arab women looking to reclaim the Arab narrative for an educated Arab audience? It turned out no one was, so Guellaty decided to.Educated in Paris, but born and now based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, 35-year-old Guellaty was at the helm of Condé Nast’s first Middle East launch, the now-closed StyleArabia, two years ago. “I kept hearing about things being ‘good enough’ for the Arab market. That really got to me, this ‘good enough’ attitude. Two things: one, it’s not good enough, what you’re doing is crap. Two, it’s racist,” Guellaty says. Two years ago, she quit Condé Nast last May she became pregnant with her first child. It was during her pregnancy that she developed the idea for Mille World. After giving birth, she recruited the first members of the board, which now includes Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and Saif Mahdhi, the president of Next Models. She recruited the company’s CEO, Nez Gebreel, from the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. It was crucial to Guellaty that her executive and editorial team were Arabs and leaders in their field.Mille World launched in January and already has 40,000 unique visitors a month. Its readers come from across the Arab world and diaspora, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt, France, the UK and the US. Its 12-person editorial staff is equally international, based in Dubai, London, Paris and Tunis. The deputy editor, Samira Larouci, 28, has lived in Dalston, London, for years, but she was raised in “very, very white” Chichester by her Moroccan parents. She left i-D magazine in July, having helped set up its luxury lifestyle site, Amuse. She was put in touch with Guellaty by a mutual friend. Their first phone call lasted two and a half hours. “We were talking about Arab identity issues I’ve always been seeking a community of my own to connect with. We both agreed there was a voice missing that we wanted to hear. It was young, inclusive and not based around materialism,” Larouci says. “We wanted to address that need. It’s almost laughable no one’s done it before.”Larouci now commissions and edits the bulk of the site’s editorial content – 60 pieces a month, every one of which is translated into English, French and Arabic. She is interested particularly in Arab counterculture and championing Arab artists who do not have any other platform in their region. “The reader I want to reach is someone studying in Washington, raised in Saudi, who’s in a sort of cultural limbo. That’s where I come from. I want to find those people in LA who are interested in feminism in the Arab world,” Larouci says.Deep in the belly of a south London car park lie the offices of gal-dem, an online magazine produced exclusively by women and non-binary people of colour. It is not big – each of the work studios in Peckham Levels has been converted from a single parking space – but it is significant. By parsing culture and current affairs through a prism of intersectional feminism, covering topics from Grenfell to mooncups, gal-dem is one of the publications changing the face of female-focused media.As a concept, gal-dem is a world away from the blinkered women’s glossies available to the editorial team in their youth. While those magazines shared some women’s stories, the scope was narrow, and much of the content was designed to reaffirm strict beauty standards. gal-dem, meanwhile, has no such agenda, aiming to provide women with just one thing: a voice. In this sense, the site is part of a much broader cultural shift in women’s media – one that has seen print titles fail (recent casualties include Company, She, Glamour, Bliss and Sugar) and a new breed of online magazine take their place. Riding the fourth wave of feminism, publications such as The Pool and Refinery 29 are fuelled not by materialism, but by a rich seam of untapped subject matter: the experiences women have long been told to keep quiet.While the gal-dem team acknowledge their position in the wider landscape of newly feminist media, they are careful to distinguish themselves from their peers. “There is a tendency within feminism for its face to be quite white and middle-class,” says Little. “To see an editorial team comprising women of colour is a rarity I think that is clearly our point of difference.” From her desk in the gal-dem offices, the deputy editor – and  contributor – Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff explains how the focus on issues that affect women of colour manifests itself in gal-dem’s attitude. “The tone in general is a bit more serious than the Refinerys and Bustles we don’t have that ‘you’re talking to your best friend’ thing going on,” she says. “The nature of the topics we’re talking about a lot of the time don’t really lend themselves to that and we don’t want to ever dilute that seriousness.”Slowly, gal-dem’s efforts to rectify a lack of representation are being echoed by the mainstream media – with decidedly mixed results. Since he took over six months ago, the Vogue editor Edward Enninful has managed to include five women of colour on his covers (February’s Vogue featured Little in a spread about “the new suffragettes”), yet glossies are still regularly derided for their treatment of black women. In November, the actor Lupita Nyong’o expressed her disappointment at Grazia’s decision to photoshop away her natural hair on its cover the previous month, the Evening Standard’s magazine caused much consternation by airbrushing Solange’s braids. And just because online magazines tend to avoid scandal, that does not mean they are necessarily much better, Brinkhurst-Cuff says. “It would be more hidden if there was an issue online, because you don’t have the physical print cover to see. We can say Alexandra Shulman only published 12 black women on the cover, whereas if an online publication is pretty much exclusively publishing white writers or using stock images of white women you’re arguably less likely to pick up on that.” That said, she sees the new online media “struggling towards intersectionality, for the right or wrong reasons. Diversity is in fashion right now, but we hope it’s not always about money.”Money, however, is something gal-dem is beginning to consider seriously. Until now, it has been a voluntary organisation. Nobody gets paid, apart from contributors on specific brand collaborations the annual print issue, the covers of which hang from the office’s chipboard walls, is more passion project than money-maker. But as the site has grown – gal-dem receives “anything from 4,000 to 20,000 unique visitors a day”, according to Little – the team believe it is turning into an economically viable enterprise. Little has just stopped working full-time and the team are developing a business plan.It is still early days for the new breed of women’s magazine and the economic forecast remains uncertain – but, in terms of broadening the scope for women’s media, the legacy of gal-dem and its peers already seems indelible.

He has also asked the Competition Markets Authority to report back on any wider competition issues the deal may raise by the end of the month.“I will then consider whether or not to refer the merger for a more detailed investigation, or whether to accept undertakings-in-lieu of such a reference,” Hancock added.

But how can you stop wasting your life in pointless meetings? Here’s an expert guideSome human inventions flash into being, get a little polish and then are pretty much left alone, their users generally satisfied, or at least not so dissatisfied that they attempt to come up with an alternative. No one tries to build a better hankie, a more comforting cuddle or a dinner plate “that really works”. Yet the search for the perfect business meeting seems never-ending. The caravan instead of the boardroom, the rubber chicken that bestows the right to speak: you name it, it has been tried and generally found to suck. Now Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has had a go, creating what he calls “the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter”.Weird? Maybe, though other words that spring to mind include “anal” and “stultifying”. As Bezos told the audience at the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, he has banned the PowerPoint presentations that dominate most commercial meetings. Instead, some poor devil must spend a week or more preparing “a six-page, narratively structured memo” full of “real sentences” rather than bullet points. Everyone else must then spend the first half-hour of the meeting silently – and publicly – pondering it, before moving on to a debate. Bezos calls this “a kind of study hall”.“Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely,” Bezos admits. “Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum …”If this sounds like your idea of hell, don’t panic. Some of the finest minds in business are working on alternatives.“This is quite pervasive in organisations now,” says Prof André Spicer from Cass Business School at City, University of London. “They might ask people to reflect for a few minutes in a meeting before making a decision. Or they’ll ask people to turn inwards, and think about what their own feelings are telling them.” Evidence suggests that injecting more mindfulness can help alleviate inidual anxiety, and help people focus better in meetings and lose the irrelevant information.“The danger of it, though,” says Spicer, “is that it gets treated as a way to cover up more systemic issues. I’ve been working with the Department of Health, which introduced a mindfulness programme to deal with health and wellness issues in the department. The truth was that the problems there were with endemic restructuring and extreme working hours – the mindfulness just extended meetings and the working day.”“The death of the long lunch is a tragedy for businesses,” says Spicer. “Many organisations had lunch together in cafeterias where everyone stopped and ate together and talked. There is research by Humanize, which studies social networks and work, that shows that people who go to lunch and sit in fairly large groups tend to do a lot better in the company, simply because they are building up networks and finding out what is going on in the business. Bring back lunch!”Actually, says Emma Sinclair, the co-founder of EnterpriseAlumni, there is a lot to be said for the regular company-wide catchup, even if it comes in the form of a traditional meeting. “People do need to feel included. And a bit of consistency is good.”“One PayPal executive, David Sacks, used to burst into meeting rooms like a prohibition-era cop and ask what people were meeting about,” says Bruce Daisley, the European vice-president at Twitter and the host of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast. “If it wasn’t any good, he would stop the meeting right then and there. I love this idea of superhero-style vigilantes closing meetings down. Imagine if the burden of having a meeting was that at any point you’d have to explain what the meeting was about. Brilliant! If all of us knew we would be held to account for the cost of a meeting and the amount of people’s time we are taking up, our perspective would be different. The meeting is taking all the fun out of our jobs because we are so scared of not being busy. But sitting at your desk and thinking is an important part of the job.”Ever sat in a meeting and wondered how much it was costing the company in terms of salaries? Tools such as Harvard Business Review’s business meeting cost calculator will put a figure on it. Spicer recommends a meeting budget. “If you want to invite a member of staff to your meeting, it will get taken off your budget. The cost of inviting loads of people to come along and listen to a PowerPoint presentation actually becomes valued, and you have to think: ‘Do we actually need this person there?’”Everyone wants meetings to be shorter, but stunts pulled in some workplaces such as making attendees hold the plank, do situps, speak against a timer or put money in a charity box if they overrun are counterproductive and, frankly, irritating. “I’m a bit suspicious of any of that jiggery-pokery,” says Stefan Stern, the co-author of Myths of Management. “That doesn’t feel like work to me. If you’re trying to achieve something from your meeting, you need to be focusing on the meat of the matter.” Rather than your aching muscles, for example.“All this show-and-tell stuff turns the meeting into a spectacle, rather than something productive,” agrees Spicer. However, he adds, standing meetings are effective at cutting meeting times. Walking and talking (favoured by Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama) has also been shown to help people work better. “Marily Oppezzo at Stanford University has done a lot of research in this area,” says Daisley. “She shows how meetings can engage ergent thought – so they help people come up with ideas, although not necessarily narrow them down.”“It’s a great idea to get people to check in their phones and laptops,” says Spicer. “Unless they are actually being used, not having them helps people focus their attention on what is actually going on in the room.” That doesn’t mean it’s not awkward, however. “I recently did some work with senior managers at a bank and they were forced to put their phones in sealed envelopes. They were constantly looking over to the cupboard where their phones were. As soon as the first break came, they ripped them open like they were crack addicts who had just seen a bag of crack. But once they had actually got focused on a task, they got a lot more done. One of the basic principles of productivity is that we are terrible at multitasking, so we need to remove as many distractions from meetings as possible.”Another Bezos rule: he won’t call a meeting, or even attend one, where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. “Meetings now are easier than ever to arrange,” says Daisley. This means they can often become “very low-quality exchanges of ideas and powerplay” if they are not considered properly and numbers kept under control. The solution is to “value the introverts”. “Most of modern work has been around celebrating the extrovert – brainstorming meetings, presentations, open-plan offices,” he says. “Performance art has become part of our job. But when you look into how a creative idea is formed, it is normally by inidual thinking and one-to-one conversation. As Susan Cain says in her book Quiet, the truth about the best collaborations is that they are in smaller groups – it’s more Lennon and McCartney than loads of people in an open-plan room.”“Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value,” the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, has said. “It is not rude to leave it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.” Of course, it is probably easier to get away with this when you are a fantastically rich company boss rather than an underpaid middle manager.“Is your meeting really necessary?” asks Stern. “As the management consultant Peter Drucker put it, ‘One either meets or one works.’” Daisley says we should abolish half of all meetings. “If you go into a meeting and somebody asks: ‘Has anyone got anything for today’s agenda?’, that should tell you that there is no point to it. We live in a world where the quality of our work is being appraised by others, by our bosses, so we never want to appear as if we’re not working hard. So when a meeting comes up that we are responsible for, we all want to show that we have packed agendas. We need to lose the fear of standing people down for meetings and cancel them.”How do you do it? Maybe cite some evidence. “We’re starting to realise that interruptions and distractions are the curse of getting anything done,” says Daisley. “We need to permit people to have quiet spaces. In Cal Newport’s book Deep Work, he argues that anything of any value is created only by a period of isolated concentration.” Something to send back on your next calendar invite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb6f97e43232032b3113bf9c8ec60c01134b931/86_104_5054_3032/master/5054.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ff97e9d9c159fa62a247bf77d5d682","title":"why replacing politicians with experts is a reckless idea","story":"In the age of Trump and Brexit, some people say that democracy is fatally flawed and we should be ruled by ‘those who know best’. Here’s why that’s not very clever. By  David RuncimanDemocracy is tired, vindictive, self-deceiving, paranoid, clumsy and frequently ineffectual. Much of the time it is living on past glories. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. But current democracy is not who we are. It is just a system of government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why don’t we replace it with something better?This line of argument has grown louder in recent years, as democratic politics has become more unpredictable and, to many, deeply alarming in its outcomes. First Brexit, then Donald Trump, plus the rise of populism and the spread of ision, has started a tentative search for plausible alternatives. But the rival systems we see around us have a very limited appeal. The unlovely forms of 21st-century authoritarianism can at best provide only a partial, pragmatic alternative to democracy. The world’s strongmen still pander to public opinion, and in the case of competitive authoritarian regimes such as the ones in Hungary and Turkey, they persist with the rigmarole of elections. From Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is not much of a leap into a brighter future.There is a far more dogmatic alternative, which has its roots in the 19th century. Why not ditch the charade of voting altogether? Stop pretending to respect the views of ordinary people – it’s not worth it, since the people keep getting it wrong. Respect the experts instead! This is the truly radical option. So should we try it?The name for this view of politics is epistocracy: the rule of the knowers. It is directly opposed to democracy, because it argues that the right to participate in political decision-making depends on whether or not you know what you are doing. The basic premise of democracy has always been that it doesn’t matter how much you know: you get a say because you have to live with the consequences of what you do. In ancient Athens, this principle was reflected in the practice of choosing office-holders by lottery. Anyone could do it because everyone – well, everyone who wasn’t a woman, a foreigner, a pauper, a slave or a child – counted as a member of the state. With the exception of jury service in some countries, we don’t choose people at random for important roles any more. But we do uphold the underlying idea by letting citizens vote without checking their suitability for the task.Critics of democracy – starting with Plato – have always argued that it means rule by the ignorant, or worse, rule by the charlatans that the ignorant people fall for. Living in Cambridge, a passionately pro-European town and home to an elite university, I heard echoes of that argument in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It was usually uttered sotto voce – you have to be a brave person to come out as an epistocrat in a democratic society – but it was unquestionably there. Behind their hands, very intelligent people muttered to each other that this is what you get if you ask a question that ordinary people don’t understand. Dominic Cummings, the author of the “Take Back Control” slogan that helped win the referendum, found that his critics were not so shy about spelling it out to his face. Brexit happened, they told him, because the wicked people lied to the stupid people. So much for democracy.To say that democrats want to be ruled by the stupid and the ignorant is unfair. No defender of democracy has ever claimed that stupidity or ignorance are virtues in themselves. But it is true that democracy doesn’t discriminate on the grounds of a lack of knowledge. It considers the ability to think intelligently about difficult questions a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is whether an inidual is implicated in the outcome. Democracy asks only that the voters should be around long enough to suffer for their own mistakes.The question that epistocracy poses is: why don’t we discriminate on the basis of knowledge? What’s so special about letting everyone take part? Behind it lies the intuitively appealing thought that, instead of living with our mistakes, we should do everything in our power to prevent them in the first place – then it wouldn’t matter who has to take responsibility.This argument has been around for more than 2,000 years. For most of that time, it has been taken very seriously. The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that democracy is usually a bad idea: it is just too risky to put power in the hands of people who don’t know what they are doing. Of course, that was only the consensus among intellectuals. We have little way of knowing what ordinary people thought about the question. Nobody was asking them.Over the course of the 20th century, the intellectual consensus was turned around. Democracy established itself as the default condition of politics, its virtues far outweighing its weaknesses. Now the events of the 21st century have revived some of the original doubts. Democracies do seem to be doing some fairly stupid things at present. Perhaps no one will be able to live with their mistakes. In the age of Trump, climate change and nuclear weapons, epistocracy has teeth again.So why don’t we give more weight to the views of the people who are best qualified to evaluate what to do? Before answering that question, it is important to distinguish between epistocracy and something with which it is often confused: technocracy. They are different. Epistocracy means rule by the people who know best. Technocracy is rule by mechanics and engineers. A technocrat is someone who understands how the machinery works.In November 2011, Greek democracy was suspended and an elected government was replaced by a cabinet of experts, tasked with stabilising the collapsing Greek economy before new elections could be held. This was an experiment in technocracy, however, not epistocracy. The engineers in this case were economists. Even highly qualified economists often haven’t a clue what’s best to do. What they know is how to operate a complex system that they have been instrumental in building – so long as it behaves the way it is meant to. Technocrats are the people who understand what’s best for the machine. But keeping the machine running might be the worst thing we could do. Technocrats won’t help with that question.Both representative democracy and pragmatic authoritarianism have plenty of space for technocracy. Increasingly, each system has put decision-making capacity in the hands of specially trained experts, particularly when it comes to economic questions. Central bankers wield significant power in a wide variety of political systems around the world. For that reason, technocracy is not really an alternative to democracy. Like populism, it is more of an add-on. What makes epistocracy different is that it prioritises the “right” decision over the technically correct decision. It tries to work out where we should be going. A technocrat can only tell us how we should get there.How would epistocracy function in practice? The obvious difficulty is knowing who should count as the knowers. There is no formal qualification for being a general expert. It is much easier to identify a suitable technocrat. Technocracy is more like plumbing than philosophy. When Greece went looking for economic experts to sort out its financial mess, it headed to Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, since that is where the technicians were congregated. When a machine goes wrong, the people responsible for fixing it often have their fingerprints all over it already.Historically, some epistocrats have tackled the problem of identifying who knows best by advocating non-technical qualifications for politics. If there were such a thing as the university of life, that’s where these epistocrats would want political decision-makers to get their higher degrees. But since there is no such university, they often have to make do with cruder tests of competence. The 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for a voting system that granted varying numbers of votes to different classes of people depending on what jobs they did. Professionals and other highly educated iniduals would get six or more votes each farmers and traders would get three or four skilled labourers would get two unskilled labourers would get one. Mill also pushed hard for women to get the vote, at a time when that was a deeply unfashionable view. He did not do this because he thought women were the equals of men. It was because he thought some women, especially the better educated, were superior to most men. Mill was a big fan of discrimination, so long as it was on the right grounds.To 21st-century eyes, Mill’s system looks grossly undemocratic. Why should a lawyer get more votes than a labourer? Mill’s answer would be to turn the question on its head: why should a labourer get the same number of votes as a lawyer? Mill was no simple democrat, but he was no technocrat either. Lawyers didn’t qualify for their extra votes because politics placed a special premium on legal expertise. No, lawyers got their extra votes because what’s needed are people who have shown an aptitude for thinking about questions with no easy answers. Mill was trying to stack the system to ensure as many different points of view as possible were represented. A government made up exclusively of economists or legal experts would have horrified him. The labourer still gets a vote. Skilled labourers get two. But even though a task like bricklaying is a skill, it is a narrow one. What was needed was breadth. Mill believed that some points of view carried more weight simply because they had been exposed to more complexity along the way.Jason Brennan, a very 21st-century philosopher, has tried to revive the epistocratic conception of politics, drawing on thinkers like Mill. In his 2016 book Against Democracy, Brennan insists that many political questions are simply too complex for most voters to comprehend. Worse, the voters are ignorant about how little they know: they lack the ability to judge complexity because they are so attached to simplistic solutions that feel right to them.Brennan writes: “Suppose the United States had a referendum on whether to allow significantly more immigrants into the country. Knowing whether this is a good idea requires tremendous social scientific knowledge. One needs to know how immigration tends to affect crime rates, domestic wages, immigrants’ welfare, economic growth, tax revenues, welfare expenditures and the like. Most Americans lack this knowledge in fact, our evidence is that they are systematically mistaken.”In other words, it’s not just that they don’t know it’s not even that they don’t know that they don’t know it’s that they are wrong in ways that reflect their unwavering belief that they are right.Brennan doesn’t have Mill’s faith that we can tell how well-equipped someone is to tackle a complex question by how difficult that person’s job is. There is too much chance and social conditioning involved. He would prefer an actual exam, to “screen out citizens who are badly misinformed or ignorant about the election, or who lack basic social scientific knowledge”. Of course, this just pushes the fundamental problem back a stage without resolving it: who gets to set the exam? Brennan teaches at a university, so he has little faith in the disinterested qualities of most social scientists, who have their own ideologies and incentives. He has also seen students cramming for exams, which can produce its own biases and blind spots. Still, he thinks Mill was right to suggest that the further one advances up the educational ladder, the more votes one should get: five extra votes for finishing high school, another five for a bachelor’s degree, and five more for a graduate degree.Brennan is under no illusions about how provocative this case is today, 150 years after Mill made it. In the middle of the 19th century, the idea that political status should track social and educational standing was barely contentious today, it is barely credible. Brennan also has to face the fact that contemporary social science provides plenty of evidence that the educated are just as subject to groupthink as other people, sometimes even more so. The political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen point this out in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists: “The historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone wrong in their moral and political thinking as often as everyone else.” Cognitive biases are no respecters of academic qualifications. How many social science graduates would judge the question about immigration according to the demanding tests that Brennan lays out, rather than according to what they would prefer to believe? The irony is that if Brennan’s voter exam were to ask whether the better-educated deserve more votes, the technically correct answer might be no. It would depend on who was marking it.However, in one respect Brennan insists that the case for epistocracy has grown far stronger since Mill made it. That is because Mill was writing at the dawn of democracy. Mill published his arguments in the run-up to what became the Second Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the size of the franchise in Britain to nearly 2.5 million voters (out of a general population of 30 million). Mill’s case for epistocracy was based on his conviction that over time it would merge into democracy. The labourer who gets one vote today would get more tomorrow, once he had learned how to use his vote wisely. Mill was a great believer in the educative power of democratic participation.Brennan thinks we now have 100-plus years of evidence that Mill was wrong. Voting is bad for us. It doesn’t make people better informed. If anything, it makes them stupider, because it dignifies their prejudices and ignorance in the name of democracy. “Political participation is not valuable for most people,” Brennan writes. “On the contrary, it does most of us little good and instead tends to stultify and corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.” The trouble with democracy is that it gives us no reason to become better informed. It tells us we are fine as we are. And we’re not.In the end, Brennan’s argument is more historical than philosophical. If we were unaware of how democracy would turn out, it might make sense to cross our fingers and assume the best of it. But he insists that we do know, and so we have no excuse to keep kidding ourselves. Brennan thinks that we should regard epistocrats like himself as being in the same position as democrats were in the mid-19th century. What he is championing is anathema to many people, as democracy was back then. Still, we took a chance on democracy, waiting to see how it would turn out. Why shouldn’t we take a chance on epistocracy, now we know how the other experiment went? Why do we assume that democracy is the only experiment we are ever allowed to run, even after it has run out of steam?It’s a serious question, and it gets to how the longevity of democracy has stifled our ability to think about the possibility of something different. What was once a seemingly reckless form of politics has become a byword for caution. And yet there are still good reasons to be cautious about ditching it. Epistocracy remains the reckless idea. There are two dangers in particular.The first is that we set the bar too high in politics by insisting on looking for the best thing to do. Sometimes it is more important to avoid the worst. Even if democracy is often bad at coming up with the right answers, it is good at unpicking the wrong ones. Moreover, it is good at exposing people who think they always know best. Democratic politics assumes there is no settled answer to any question and it ensures that is the case by allowing everyone a vote, including the ignorant. The randomness of democracy – which remains its essential quality – protects us against getting stuck with truly bad ideas. It means that nothing will last for long, because something else will come along to disrupt it.Epistocracy is flawed because of the second part of the word rather than the first – this is about power (kratos) as much as it is about knowledge (episteme). Fixing power to knowledge risks creating a monster that can’t be deflected from its course, even when it goes wrong – which it will, since no one and nothing is infallible. Not knowing the right answer is a great defence against people who believe that their knowledge makes them superior.Brennan’s response to this argument (a version of which is made by David Estlund in his 2007 book Democratic Authority) is to turn it on its head. Since democracy is a form of kratos, too, he says, why aren’t we concerned about protecting iniduals from the incompetence of the demos just as much as from the arrogance of the epistocrats? But these are not the same kinds of power. Ignorance and foolishness don’t oppress in the same way that knowledge and wisdom do, precisely because they are incompetent: the demos keeps changing its mind.The democratic case against epistocracy is a version of the democratic case against pragmatic authoritarianism. You have to ask yourself where you’d rather be when things go wrong. Maybe things will go wrong quicker and more often in a democracy, but that is a different issue. Rather than thinking of democracy as the least worst form of politics, we could think of it as the best when at its worst. It is the difference between Winston Churchill’s famous dictum and a similar one from Alexis de Tocqueville a hundred years earlier that is less well-known but more apposite. More fires get started in a democracy, de Tocqueville said, but more fires get put out, too.The recklessness of epistocracy is also a function of the historical record that Brennan uses to defend it. A century or more of democracy may have uncovered its failings, but they have also taught us that we can live with them. We are used to the mess and attached to the benefits. Being an epistocrat like Mill before democracy had got going is very different from being one now that democracy is well established. We now know what we know, not just about democracy’s failings, but about our tolerance for its incompetences.The great German sociologist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the 20th century, took it for granted that universal suffrage was a dangerous idea, because of the way that it empowered the mindless masses. But he argued that once it had been granted, no sane politician should ever think about taking it away: the backlash would be too terrible. The only thing worse than letting everyone vote is telling some people that they no longer qualify. Never mind who sets the exam, who is going to tell us that we’ve failed? Mill was right: democracy comes after epistocracy, not before. You can’t run the experiment in reverse.The cognitive biases that epistocracy is meant to rescue us from are what will ultimately scupper it. Loss aversion makes it more painful to be deprived of something we have that doesn’t always work than something we don’t have that might. It’s like the old joke. Q: “Do you know the way to Dublin?” A: “Well, I wouldn’t start from here.” How do we get to a better politics? Well, maybe we shouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are.Still, there must be other ways of trying to inject more wisdom into democratic politics than an exam. This is the 21st century: we have new tools to work with. If many of the problems with democracy derive from the business of politicians hawking for votes at election time, which feeds noise and bile into the decision-making process, perhaps we should try to simulate what people would choose under more sedate and reflective conditions. For instance, it may be possible to extrapolate from what is known about voters’ interests and preferences what they ought to want if they were better able to access the knowledge they needed. We could run mock elections that replicate the input from different points of view, as happens in real elections, but which strip out all the distractions and distortions of democracy in action.Brennan suggests the following: “We can administer surveys that track citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what ‘We the People’ would want, if only ‘We the People’ understood what we were talking about.”Democratic dignity – the idea that all citizens should be allowed to express their views and have them taken seriously by politicians – goes out the window under such a system. We are each reduced to data points in a machine-learning exercise. But, according to Brennan, the outcomes should improve.In 2017, a US-based digital technology company called Kimera Systems announced that it was close to developing an AI named Nigel, whose job was to help voters know how they should vote in an election, based on what it already knew of their personal preferences. Its creator, Mounir Shita, declared: “Nigel tries to figure out your goals and what reality looks like to you and is constantly assimilating paths to the future to reach your goals. It’s constantly trying to push you in the right direction.”This is the more personalised version of what Brennan\u0026nbspis proposing, with some of the democratic dignity plugged back in. Nigel is not trying to work out what’s best for everyone, only what’s best for you. It accepts your version of reality. Yet Nigel understands that you are incapable of drawing the correct political inferences from your preferences. You need help, from a\u0026nbspmachine that has seen enough of your personal behaviour to understand what it is you are after. Siri recommends books you might like. Nigel recommends political parties and policy positions.Would this be so bad? To many people it instinctively sounds like a parody of democracy because it treats us like confused children. But to Shita it is an enhancement of democracy because it takes our desires seriously. Democratic politicians don’t much care what it is that\u0026nbspwe actually want. They care what it is they can persuade us we want, so they can better appeal to it. Nigel puts the voter first. At the same time, by protecting us from our own confusion and inattention, Nigel strives to improve our self-understanding. Brennan’s version effectively gives up on Mill’s original\u0026nbspidea that voting might be an educative experience. Shita hasn’t given up. Nigel is trying to nudge us along the path to self-knowledge. We\u0026nbspmight end up learning who we really are.The fatal flaw with this approach, however, is that we risk learning only who it is we think we are, or who it is we would like to be. Worse, it is who we would like to be now, not who or what we might become in the future. Like focus groups, Nigel provides a snapshot of a set of\u0026nbspattitudes at a moment in time. The danger of any system\u0026nbspof machine learning is that it produces feedback\u0026nbsploops. By restricting the dataset to our past behaviour, Nigel teaches us nothing about what other people think, or even about other ways of seeing the world. Nigel simply mines the archive of our attitudes for the most consistent expression of our identities. If we lean left, we will end up leaning further left. If we lean right, we will end up leaning further right. Social and political ision would widen. Nigel is designed to\u0026nbspclose the circle in our minds.There are technical fixes for feedback loops. Systems can be adjusted to inject alternative points of view, to notice when data is becoming self-reinforcing or simply to randomise the evidence. We can shake things up to lessen the risk that we get set in our ways. For instance, Nigel could make sure that we visit websites that challenge rather than reinforce our preferences. Alternatively, on Brennan’s model, the aggregation of\u0026nbspour preferences could seek to take account of the likelihood that Nigel had exaggerated rather than tempered who we really are. A Nigel of Nigels – a machine that helps other machines to better align their\u0026nbspown goals – could try to strip out the distortions from the artificial democracy we have built. After all, Nigel is our servant, not our master. We can always tell him what to do.But that is the other fundamental problem with 21st-century epistocracy: we won’t be the ones telling Nigel what to do. It will be the technicians who have built the system. They are the experts we rely on to rescue us from feedback loops. For this reason, it is hard\u0026nbspto see how 21st-century epistocracy can avoid collapsing back into technocracy. When things go wrong, the knowers will be powerless to correct for them. Only the engineers who built the machines have\u0026nbspthat capacity, which means that it will be the engineers who have the power.In recent weeks, we have been given a glimpse of\u0026nbspwhat rule by engineers might look like. It is not an authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence. It is a picture of confusion and obfuscation. The power of engineers never fully comes out into the open, because most people don’t understand what it is they do. The sight of Mark Zuckerberg, perched on his cushion, batting off the ignorant questions of the people’s representatives in Congress is a glimpse of a technocratic future in which democracy meets its\u0026nbspmatch. But this is not a radical alternative to democratic politics. It is simply a distortion of it.Adapted from How Democracy Ends by David Runciman, which will be published by Profile on 10 May.

Labour would have to take 15 more seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control.But many believe that the tide is turning. Labour’s Emma Dent Coad sent shockwaves through the local Tory establishment when she won Kensington at the 2017 general election, primarily on the back of Brexit in one of the most remain-supporting constituencies in the country.Then came the horrors of the Grenfell fire, which killed 71 people, and the woefully inadequate response from the town hall which saw even national Tory politicians heaping on the criticism.Jackie Michael, 57, who has lived in the north of the borough for more than a decade, said: “It is inconceivable that the Tories hang on to the council after the disastrous way they responded to the fire. All you need to do is look up, and you see the tower. It’s a constant symbol of their ineptitude.”But Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, is cautious. “In the last 12 months we’ve made astonishing progress in all areas of K\u0026ampC and while we may not take the council this time, we’re certainly going to come close to it,” he told the . “But there will be future elections and we will then be starting from a much stronger position.”Party insiders believe the most likely outcome is that it piles on votes in wards it already holds, while picking up a few extra seats in those which are currently split between the two main parties, although not enough to take control. “But we’re fighting seriously in wards where we haven’t fought for years,” said one Labour candidate.They also play down the relevance of Dent Coad’s victory. “It’s not quite as revolutionary as people think,” said one, suggesting the outspoken MP fears she may not win a second time so is keeping her options open by standing again for the council.Momentum has been out in force and, although Corbyn was campaigning in Ladbroke Grove, so far he has stayed away from the south of the borough. “I don’t think it would help if he was seen down the Kings Road,” said one party insider.Back in Chelsea, however, Labour is knocking on some doors it never has before. Activists report that some lifelong Tory voters think the council’s handling of Grenfell has been a disgrace, but concede that the most they can hope for is that they stay at home on Thursday.The local Conservative party was condemned for its insensitivity in November for sending out a questionnaire in one of the richest parts of the borough asking people to rate the importance of Grenfell as an issue alongside rubbish collections and parking.But some voters think that enough is enough. “The council has spent a fortune on big new homes for Grenfell victims. Why are they still complaining? It’s about time the self-flagellation stopped,” said one.Labour is attempting to stir up anti-Brexit sentiment among the thousands of European citizens who live in the borough – many of them in Chelsea - and who make up almost a fifth of the electorate.“Don’t overlook the fury of the Europeans,” said one candidate. “Usually these people don’t think local government matters. So we hope some can be prodded into casting a protest vote.”The biggest issues that come up on the doorstep in this part of the borough, however, are planning and parking. John Miller, 72, a retired accountant, said: “While we all recognise how terrible Grenfell was, I think any council would have struggled to deal with it. I am more likely to judge them on how they look after our public realm and our streets.”Whatever the result, the incoming council is going to look very different to the old one, with 17 Tory councillors not standing for re-election. Some have retired, others have stepped down over the fire and its aftermath.The Tory leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who took over after the fire, has been campaigning “all over the borough”, perhaps mindful of the damage done when she admitted she had never been inside a tower block before Grenfell.She is reluctant to comment on whether the tragedy – or the fact that some victims are still waiting for new permanent homes – will affect her electoral chances. “I can’t predict things. I can only just work as hard as I can, so we will see. Ask me afterwards,” she said in one interview.Daniel Moylan, a former deputy leader of the council who is standing down as councillor this time, is also hedging his bets. “It will be tough for the Conservatives. We could lose some seats but it will be difficult for Labour to take control of the council,” he said. “It would be a political tsunami if we lost. Though, of course, tsunamis do happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8858f93535e439a43d6b9c1fdad20ec09a934d/0_70_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad5938affb5dc440a07350b792296ae","title":"government claim of voter surge misleading says watchdog","story":"Statistics authority deals blow to argument in favour of making ID compulsory to vote in electionsThe official statistics watchdog has condemned one of the government’s main arguments in favour of trialling compulsory voter ID, saying a claim that incidents of voter fraud had more than doubled in two years was misleading.The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) made the comments after a voter complained about the claim, first made by the Cabinet Office, and then repeated by the five local boroughs testing voter ID on Thursday: Bromley, Woking, Gosport, Watford and Swindon.The Cabinet Office said the trial for English voters was deemed necessary “after reports of alleged electoral fraud through voter impersonation more than doubled between 2014 and 2016”, citing Electoral Commission data.The voter complained that not only was the dataset tiny – a rise from 21 cases in 2014 to 44 in 2016 – but that the Cabinet Office failed to mention that the number of allegations then fell by more than a third in 2017, to 28.They also pointed out that in 2016, a year that included the EU referendum, more than twice as many votes were cast than in 2014, meaning the rise in cases was even more statistically meaningless.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.The voter complained to the UKSA citing the use of the statistic by Swindon, having initially seen the claim on a leaflet produced by the council. Even though the UKSA does not officially comment on local authority statistics, a staff member responded. In an email passed by the voter to the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), they wrote: “We have reviewed the evidence presented in your email and we would tend to agree that the presentation of electoral fraud statistics in the letter is misleading. The figures could have been presented alongside the statement for clarity.”The verdict from the UKSA, the official body tasked with ensuring government departments use statistics accurately and honestly, is another rebuff for a project which has been condemned for targeting an extremely rare problem while potentially disenfranchising vulnerable groups such as older people and the homeless, who might not have the necessary ID.It has also emerged that none of the five trial areas have recorded any cases of voter impersonation in recent years, with one expert characterising the scheme as “a solution in search of a problem”.This week the ERS said it believed the plans were deeply flawed and represented a “calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens”.Darren Hughes, chief executive of the ERS, said the verdict of the statistics watchdog illustrated the “dodgy foundations” for the scheme.He said: “Ministers are grasping at straws, and their draconian push to make ordinary voters show their papers before using their right to vote now looks desperate. The government must stop trying to trick voters and come clean.”On Thursday voters in Bromley, Woking and Gosport will have to show photo ID, or two items showing their address from a list of approved documents. If they don’t possess these they can apply in person for a document allowing them to vote. Those in Watford and Swindon must bring their polling cards, while there are separate tests connected to postal votes. The Cabinet Office, which is leading the trial, argues that voter ID had been sought by the Electoral Commission and in a report on voting fraud by Tory MP Eric Pickles, and that voters in Northern Ireland have had to show ID since 2003.The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the use of the statistics, saying in a statement: “The Electoral Commission has been clear that it wants to see the introduction of voter ID as a priority. Electoral fraud is unacceptable on any level, and vulnerabilities cannot be allowed to continue and undermine the integrity of our democracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ccf23865a542882fa71cf4ef707cb7149ac7bd7/0_608_1819_1090/master/1819.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9698b2e86f7131bbc879490839483d0f","title":"liam fox accuses lords of trying to block brexit","story":"Senior Tories say amendments to EU withdrawal bill risk tying government’s hands in Brussels talksTheresa May and cabinet ministers have expressed “strong disappointment” at a string of fresh defeats in the House of Lords over the EU withdrawal bill, with Liam Fox accusing unelected peers of trying to block the UK from leaving the European Union.Ministers said they were concerned that the amendments risked tying the government’s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels at discussions during its weekly meeting, Downing Street said. The prime minister and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the cabinet the government would be “robust” when the bill returned to the House of Commons, her spokesman said, saying it was “vital to ensure that the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of everybody in the UK”.Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Fox said it would be rash for Labour MPs who represent leave-voting constituencies to back the Lords’ amendments to the EU withdrawal bill when it returns to the Commons.The government suffered three more Brexit defeats in the House of Lords overnight, taking the total to nine, and Fox’s appeal to Labour MPs suggests the government is banking on the support of opposition Brexiters to quash the changes.The key defeat was an amendment that would allow parliament to send ministers back to the negotiating table if MPs voted down Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Labour said the new clause to the EU withdrawal bill would in effect prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal and would give Tory remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging deal. The cross-party amendment, supported by 19 Conservative rebels, succeeded with a majority of 91. Fox said on Tuesday: “I think there’s a very big debate now about whether the unelected house can actually thwart the view of the British electorate in a referendum and … legislation coming from the House of Commons.”He conceded the parliamentary arithmetic was difficult in a hung parliament. “We don’t have a parliamentary majority and that makes life harder, but there are of course quite a number of Labour MPs who represent seats where there is a very heavy vote in favour of leaving … who I think are rash, to say the least, if they try to confront the democratic view of the British people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Downing Street would not commit to saying the prime minister was confident she would overturn all of the defeats in the Lords. “We will look at the amendments, but the fundamental point is that the bill left the House of Commons in a way that could deliver a smooth Brexit and that is how we want the bill to complete its course,” the spokesman said. “What is important is that it keeps the government’s hands open on negotiations with Brussels.” The slew of Lords defeats, and the difficulties they will pose in the Commons, will cast a shadow over a crucial meeting of the Brexit cabinet subcommittee this week, where senior ministers are split over the customs union.Key Brexiters want to drop one of the two options put forward by the government. Fox and Boris Johnson have called on May to abandon her preferred option of a “customs partnership”, which relies on Britain collecting EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.The option would bring the UK closer to solving issues over the Northern Irish border but Brexiter critics have said it would be a customs union in all but name. Fox said on Tuesday: “I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable. If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed, and did not challenge the assertion by the Today presenter John Humphrys that May was a “horribly weakened prime minister”, replying that a hung parliament had made agreeing its Brexit legislation harder.Overnight, peers also voted for an amendment that would require parliamentary approval for the Brexit negotiating mandate in phase two of the talks – similar to the process where EU27 leaders approve the mandate of their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The third defeat was led by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, who won backing for his amendment that would ensure child asylum seekers would be allowed to join family members in the UK after Brexit.A Liberal Democrat attempt to amend the bill to give voters a referendum on the final deal did not pass, although one Labour frontbench peer, Philip Hunt, ignored party orders to abstain and voted in favour. Labour sources said he would be hauled before Labour’s leader in the Lords and chief whip, but the Conservatives called for him to be sacked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c6a2598230a414b858f0366b349a2511499858/0_735_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa16ae1b1235e2369b46181fb989044f","title":"uk to introduce public ownership registers for overseas territories","story":"Government says it will support bill amendment to introduce public ownership registers in Britain’s overseas territories Britain’s overseas territories will have to introduce public ownership registers, after a minister announced the government would support a backbench amendment designed to stem the global flow of “dirty money”.Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, told the Commons that the Conservatives recognised “the majority view in this house” and that the government would not oppose an amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill put down by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge and the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell.The retreat came minutes after the Speaker rejected a string of government compromise amendments, which would have watered down the disclosure commitment, because they were tabled so late.The HodgeMitchell amendment requires the 14 overseas territories, including the financial centres of the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, to introduce public ownership registers by the end of 2020 or face having them imposed by the UK government.Duncan told MPs that ministers were reluctant to dictate to the overseas territories, but added: “We have listened to the strength of feeling in this house on this issue and accept that it is without a doubt the majority view of this house that the overseas territories should have public registers.”About half of the companies referred to in the Panama Papers, offshore ownership disclosures revealed by a consortium of investigative journalist organisations including the , were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via the British overseas territories between 2007 and 2016.The Panama Papers are a leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by\u0026nbspthe German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with\u0026nbspa network of international partners, including the , in April 2016.The documents show the myriad ways in which the rich exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders were among 143 politicians, their families and close associates shown to have been using offshore tax havens. They included the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif the former vice-president of Iraq, Ayad Allawi the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson.An offshore investment fund run by the father of the then British prime minister David Cameron\u0026nbspavoided paying tax in Britain by hiring residents of the Bahamas to sign its paperwork.The leak is larger than the\u0026nbspUS diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, and the\u0026nbspsecret intelligence documents given to journalists by Edward Snowden in 2013.Hodge said the importance of the issue justified intervention in the affairs of the overseas territories. “The areas on which we have intervened … are moral issues. I can’t think of another issue which is more moral than trying to intervene to prevent the traffic in corrupt money and illicit finance across the world.”Mitchell told MPs that the justification for disclosure was made “elegantly but passively” by the leaking of the Panama and Paradise Papers, which revealed the true owners of thousands of offshore companies. “It is only by openness and scrutiny, by allowing charities, NGOs and the media to join up the dots, that we can expose this dirty money and those people standing behind it.

That was enough to defeat the government had the matter been put to a vote.Representatives of the territories had argued that the disclosure requirement would be expensive to implement at a time when countries in the Caribbean were recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma. A few MPs questioned whether how effective public disclosure would be. Geoffrey Cox, a Conservative backbencher, said the benefit from transparency would be “a one-hit wonder” and argued that “money will go to where it is darkest”, other global territories where there are no public disclosure requirements.The amendment does not apply to the crown dependencies, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, because parliament does not have the legal right to impose its will on them. However, Mitchell said that in the light of the success of the amendment parliament would expect the government “to make the point persuasively, that we hope that the crown dependencies embrace the same ethical position and equal transparency”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1e8c7180255ca899c279203f531688fe8bc400b/0_49_1946_1168/master/1946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8306e555dabb1766f0fc9798cd7a135f","title":"brexit david davis lords liam fox tells may that compromising over customs union would be unacceptable politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including David Davis giving evidence to the Lords EU committee on BrexitQ: Would not having a hard border mean no physical infrastructure?At the border, says Davis.He says, whatever infrastructure there would be, it would not be wise to put it up.He says the existing border is done by intelligence-led policing and customs arrangements. That could include automatic number plate recognition cameras, but back in Belfast.Davis says he cannot imagine the circumstance in which the Irish government would put up a hard border.But he says it is for both sides to take responsibility for finding a solution to the problem.Davis is summing up the government’s two proposed customs models.The commission “pushed back on both”, he says.They were concerned about how the “customs partnership” (the one involving the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU) would be run.And, with the highly-streamlined customs arrangement, they were concerned about the impact of exempting smaller traders.Q: You visited the Irish border recently. What were your impressions?Davis says there are concerns there.He saw a sign saying that a road would be closed in the event of a hard Brexit. He thought that was wrong.But he has briefings from the police. What they said about the potential problems was “very forthright”.Davis says it is important to remember that the Ireland border is not a non-border. There is a border on customs and on tax, he says.If there is a free trade agreement, there will be no tariffs.So the border issue will be a regulatory issue, he says. But he says no one is arguing for the UK to stay in the single market.Davis says, if the UK had tried to extend the transition beyond December 2020, the UK would have had to contribute to a new MFF (multi-annual financial framework - a longterm EU budget.) The bill might have been quite high, he says.Davis says the government wants the defence and security partnership in place as soon as possible, and potentially before the end of the transition.Q: Do you agree with the head of the NAO who said that, once the withdrawal agreement comes into force, the legal payments will be legally binding?Davis says, when you make a deal, you should read the text. So it will depend what the legal text says.Q: Will the payments be staggered?Yes, says Davis. It will take quite some years for them to be paid. There was a suggestion that they would last for 40 years, he says.That was just pension liabilities, a peer says.Davis says for the vast majority of the EU 27 states, Brexit is not the priority it is in the UK.But he says it varies from region to region.Q: Barnier has said formal negotiations on a trade relationship will only start after the UK has left the EU.Davis says he does not accept that.He wants to conclude the trade negotiation by then. Then it will have to be signed, and ratified.This is from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll.Davis is now talking about whether Britons living in the EU will have onward movement rights (the right to move, say, from Spain to France). He says he did not realise until recently how important this was to some retirees.He says the commission is treating this as an ongoing relationship issue. It remains to be resolved, he says.These are from RTE’s Tony Connolly.The Labour peer and QC Helena Kennedy goes next.Q: Will there be a legal text by June?Davis says that is unlikely.He says the main aim is to get the whole thing finished by October.He says the UK has been trying to agree with the commission a timetable for talks.He says the UK wants to talk about various aspects in parallel.Q: So the framework for a future relationship will be an important document, with more than just aspirations.Absolutely, says Davis. He says the UK takes the view this will have to be fairly substantive. It must contain more than “airy fairy aims”.He says parliamentarians will have to vote for the withdrawal agreement. And they will not vote to pay the EU £39bn if they do not want to know what they are getting.He says the implementation period has to be just that the government has to know that it is implementing.And businesses need to know where they are heading.After opening remarks from the chair, Lord Boswell, the hearing gets suspended because there is a ision in the Commons and Davis is off to vote.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is giving evidence to the Lords EU committee.Here are the topics the committee intends to cover.The text of the withdrawal agreement and the timeline for agreementThe Government’s position on a customs union with the EUThe Government’s proposals for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern IrelandThe future relationship between the UK and the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The reports come from NHS Digital (England only) and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.“Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example.“The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations.“Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.”He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP.“Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.”Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a974104a1948f5b8cd3e26fae7cdf5cbb3bc91a/255_386_2458_1475/master/2458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a82fe66d77431d94bcaaf3308732128","title":"england and australia to start world test championship with 2019 ashes","story":"England and Australia have agreed to make next year’s Ashes the first series that will count towards the new nine-team World Test Championship.A league structure for Test cricket from 2019 was signed off by the International Cricket Council board at a meeting in Kolkata last week and it has now been confirmed that the format’s longest standing rivalry will see in the new era.It means both the Ashes and points will be at stake when England and holders Australia meet at Edgbaston, Headingley, Lord’s, Old Trafford and the Oval in what is already a bumper summer given the World Cup that comes before.Under the new Test championship rules, each of the nine teams must play three series at home and three away over a two-year period – it will not, therefore, be all plays all – with points allocated to a league table and the top two then playing a final.The first of these showpiece finals is scheduled to be played in June 2021 and Lord’s is currently the favourite to host, given its prestige in the eyes of all touring nations and London’s erse\u0026nbsppopulation.The ICC is yet to announce the full details as the points system is still being devised. The governing body’s general manager, Geoff Allardice, and his department are working through various mathematical models.One idea being explored is the allocation of 100 points to each series – which must be between two and five Tests – with the winners taking 60 and the remaining 40 allocated based on the results of each match so-called dead-rubbers will therefore have a fresh incentive.Another consideration is the final. The ICC must decide how best to create a marquee finish and what occurs in the event of a draw, with a concern being that the top-ranked side may not play to win if a stalemate is enough for glory. A six-day Test match was used to ensure a result in the Super Test between Australia and an ICC World XI in Sydney in 2005 – the hosts, at it happens, won in three and a half days – and could be one possibility.Zimbabwe and the two sides most recently granted Test status – Ireland and Afghanistan – will not be included in the competition at this stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15168281628687001f254c295c329bfbd0ea77ab/0_215_3230_1938/master/3230.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6473c0417dfa021361661d3b5b16dba","title":"formula one revamp cars boost overtaking 2019","story":"Formula One is to adopt new aerodynamic regulations for 2019 in an attempt to increase overtaking. The FIA confirmed on Tuesday the rule changes would be implemented next season, subject to approval by the World Motor Sport council, although it is understood there was opposition from a majority of teams.The FIA had begun investigating the difficulties in passing after this season’s opening race in Australia, where there were only five overtaking manoeuvres. The key changes are: a simplified front wing intended to direct air inward rather than outside the front wheels, reducing the turbulent air for following cars a wider and deeper rear wing, to allow a larger wing flap and increase the effect of the DRS simplified front brake ducts with no winglets.“The studies indicated a likelihood of a positive impact on racing and overtaking,” the FIA said. The proposals had been discussed at the Bahrain Grand Prix but no agreement was reached, with Albert Park being notoriously difficult to pass on being cited. Nonetheless research continued, with the teams taking part.A vote was held on Monday, the final day that regulation changes can be enforced without unanimous approval. Williams are the only team to have publicly supported the changes but it is understood Mercedes, Force India and Sauber were also in favour.The proposals are based around the research the F1 sporting director, Ross Brawn, has conducted while planning for the major regulation change in 2021. Given the sport adopted new rules last year and is to do so again in two years, there was opposition based on maintaining the status quo for stability.The proposals have been pushed by the FIA and F1’s owners, Liberty Media, in an effort to improve the show. The last major regulation change in 2017 made for faster cars with higher downforce but created considerable turbulent air in their wake. This reduces downforce for pursuing cars and prevents them from closing.Lewis Hamilton is among many drivers who have been critical of the situation. After pursuing Sebastian Vettel in Australia, he said: “I couldn’t for the life of me, with all my abilities, all my tools, I just couldn’t get close enough to be in fighting range.”Brawn described it as “an important step”, and one taken after considerable analysis. “It’s important to note that the decision has been taken after an intense period of research into the FIA’s proposals, which were made with the support of Formula One and, conducted by a majority of the teams,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c77ed6395856682e8a99d11af589eaaf8a6181/0_30_4401_2640/master/4401.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b452bf4cc531400b0b6f9037b3d75b","title":"tom brady retirement age new england patriots","story":"While much of focus of the last week has been on the new generation of quarterbacks drafted into the NFL, the league’s most bankable star says he intends to continue playing well into his fifth decade.In January the New England Patriots denied reports a rift had formed between team owner Robert Kraft, coach Bill Belichick and Brady.

When it comes to Caster Semenya and the IAAF, here’s a seventh. Be wary of anyone who says it’s all straightforward. The Semenya case isn’t just about sport, or sex, or gender, but ethics, politics, culture, race, and science. Expert opinion is split. Which is why the arguments have been going back and forth for the best part of a decade, and the case now seems bound to return to the court of arbitration for sport, where they will try to find the black and the white in all the shades of grey.Semenya keeps her counsel, her only public comments her pointed tweets. There’s a wildfire burning around her. The IAAF has been accused of discrimination, of racism, of propagating heteronormative standards of femininity, of trying to dictate what is and isn’t normal. Their policy has been compared to those used in apartheid South Africa, and said, by a member of the IAAF’s own disciplinary tribunal, to be “based on the same kind of ideology that has led to some of the worst injustices and atrocities in the history of our planet”.The language is fierce. There are athletes and coaches who disagree, but few will speak publicly.Athletes with Differences of Sexual Development, like Semenya, have significantly higher testosterone levels than the women they’re competing against. According to the IAAF, the typical female range of circulating testosterone in serum is 0.12 to 1.79 nmolL, while the typical male range is 7.7 to 29.4nmolL. Females with DSD often have testosterone levels in the male range. And since the IAAF’s position is that testosterone is the key distinguishing factor between male and female performance, they believe athletes with DSD have an unfair advantage.“Unfair” is the key word. Because on the one side, there’s an argument that high testosterone is just another natural advantage, like a basketballer’s reach or a swimmer’s large feet. And on the other, that basketball doesn’t ide players by height, and swimming doesn’t seek to protect swimmers with smaller feet. But because it has male and female categories, athletics does split competition between those with high and low testosterone, to protect the female athletes.Here, then, testosterone has been conflated with sex, as if it were the only measure of difference between men and women. It’s not, of course, it’s just the one the IAAF has settled on, because other methods it could use, such as chromosome testing, are flawed. But so is this. Because while it might seem intuitively true that testosterone provides a performance advantage, the IAAF needs to prove it, too. And it has to show that the advantage is so great that it can justify a set of regulations many think are discriminatory. Which is where its case failed the last time it came before Cas in 2015, and, it seems, where it will likely fail again if it comes back there now.In 2015, Cas suspended the old set of regulations while the IAAF went away to gather new evidence. Instead the IAAF produced new regulations. The new set only apply to distances between 400m and one mile, where, the IAAF says, testosterone advantage is most pronounced. This is the very same range of events Semenya runs. Which means that, even though none of the IAAF literature mentions Semenya, the rules seem, in the words of the South African minister of sport, Tokozile Xasa, like “Caster Semenya Regulations”.Before we begin to address the critiques of their motives, to wrangle with the complicated questions about the ethics of fairness, the IAAF has to prove the science supports its case this time. And, judging by what is publicly available, it can’t.Last year the IAAF released a key study, which found that female athletes with higher levels of testosterone had an advantage in five events, the 400m, 400m hurdles, 800m, hammer throw, and pole vault. And that study, which underpins these new regulations, now looks deeply flawed. Andrew Gelman, Higgins professor of statistics at Columbia University, described the analysis as “such a mess that I can’t really figure out what data they are working with, what exactly they are doing, or the connection between some of their analyses and their scientific goals”.Gelman is a rare voice in all this, one without any emotional investment, or even an interest in the sport. His only concern is the work. And he found it lacking. The IAAF says that this was only one paper, and that its case is bolstered by a body of confidential data. But still, after 15 years of study, its very best public evidence was debunked within weeks of its release. If after a decade of trying the IAAF still can’t prove it is right that DSD athletes shouldn’t be allowed to compete unless they lower their testosterone, then all these hard questions fade in to one easy, unavoidable, answer. The IAAF has got it wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67cbe5b961bd99029c1bd343bd04dfea3073aa44/383_677_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33694c28f8ff8205598f0f5e2fd522a9","title":"porn tackroom theatre why is the sky blue","story":"Drama created after Tackroom Theatre teamed up with Barnardo’s to conduct the largest piece of research ever done into the subjectThere’s no holding back in the rehearsal room, with talk of sex, incest porn and bondage. One musical number has a chorus about masturbating. It is funny, revealing and deeply troubling. The play, Why Is the Sky Blue? (Or How to Make Slime), is based on interviews with 10,000 people aged between six and 22, about the effects of pornography on their lives. Its title comes from the children’s search-engine questions, which included “Am I gay?” and “How big is my penis?”Tackroom Theatre worked with schools, theatres and the charity Barnardo’s to conduct the largest piece of research ever undertaken on the subject. As well as the play, which runs for three weeks at London’s Southwark Playhouse in London, there will be a website and educational material.“It’s been a really long-held ambition of mine to do this,” says the director, Abbey Wright. “We wanted to attempt to track the influence of porn from when people first see it, sometimes around six or seven, to when they’re first entering into adult relationships.” The main challenges of working with performers who are so young have been regarding what is age-appropriate. “It gets to three o’clock and you really ought to rehearse an explicit song but there’s a seven-year-old who hasn’t been picked up yet,” Wright says. The younger children wear noise-cancelling headphones during the more explicit content.In rehearsals, two actors are having a conversation about what sort of porn they watch one of them smiles and looks embarrassed. These aren’t scripted, and come from the actors’ own experiences. “We are put in quite a vulnerable position but I think the way we feel comfortable with it is we still have our own boundaries,” says one of the actors, 20-year-old Zachary Hing. “We know what we’re comfortable saying on that night. If there are circumstances or if one night someone is in the audience that we don’t want to share things with, we have that freedom to go: ‘I’m not going to reveal these things.’ When I’m talking about racism or transphobia, it doesn’t necessarily feel like I’m sharing something personal but it feels like I’m talking about a wider social issue.”Eleven years ago, Wright was working with young offenders. “I observed the extent to which pornography was shaping the way they thought about themselves and relationships,” she says. “I saw kids who were quite disturbed and confused by it and then I saw kids who completely accepted it, but in a way that I felt made them quite disconnected from themselves. I found it quite sad.” She wanted to create a project “which would have a genuine impact nationally. We started talking to children and asking about their experience, and realised children’s voices had to be the centre of the piece.”Wright also says there are the “ambiguous aspects” to porn. “I meet a lot of young queer people who talk about how queer porn isn’t necessarily a great representation of queer identity, but at least it’s something,” she says. When LGBT sexuality is rarely discussed sex education classes, porn becomes educational for many young people. “I’ve met young people who talk about that wonderful moment of liberation when they stop trying to force themselves to watch straight porn.”What is most shocking to Wright is “the lack of conversation and education on the subject”. She isn’t claiming to have come up a solution to the problem of pornography, but advocates much greater education as well as providing parents and teachers with the tools to have difficult conversations. One 14-year-old girl told her: “If you put a phone in a child’s hand, you are putting porn in their hand. Don’t put a phone in a child’s hand unless you are happy to talk to them about porn.”Wright hopes to tour a smaller version of the show and plans to do workshops with 25 theatres around the country. “There are always dangers in the world for children,” says Wright, “but somehow empowering them and giving them the tools to navigate those dangers in a very positive way seems like quite a hopeful thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b500b0bdfbc8e5b42c3e11bd6635299d2b845b/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a277c2177aaa7cd07a07883cc68ff4c","title":"brighton and hove council turns down uber licence renewal","story":"Firm can continue to operate while it appeals against ruling that it is not ‘fit and proper’Brighton and Hove has become the second British city to reject Uber, after the council decided not to renew the firm’s licence to operate private hire cars.A licensing panel announced on Monday that Uber was not a fit and proper company to continue operating in Brighton. Uber will appeal against the ruling.The panel cited concerns over a data breach in which Uber customers’ personal details were leaked, and the number of Uber drivers who were not licensed in Brighton but were operating in the city.The decision, made unanimously at a hearing on 23 April, echoes that of Transport for London, which turned down Uber’s application to renew its licence in the capital last September. The chair of the licensing panel, Jackie O’Quinn, said: “Our priority is the safety of residents and visitors and, due to the data breach and the lack of commitment to using drivers licensed here, we were not satisfied that Uber Britannia Ltd are a fit and proper person to hold an operator’s licence in the city.”An Uber spokesperson said: “This is a disappointing decision for the thousands of passengers and drivers who rely on our app in Brighton and Hove. We intend to appeal so we can continue serving the city.”As in London, Uber will be able to continue to operate in Brighton until the outcome of its appeal. The firm says it complies with all national private hire legislation, which allows drivers to work across England and Wales if they, their vehicle and operator are all licensed by the same authority. However, such “cross-border” working has become a growing issue with ride-hailing services such as Uber. Brighton said out-of-town drivers posed a risk to public safety, with regulations elsewhere failing to meet its own standards, including safety aspects such as CCTV in cabs. The council also pointed to a rush of licence applications in nearby Lewes, after a comparison page was publicised on Uber’s website. It said it expected that the majority of those applying – 130 in a month – would attempt to work in Brighton, and it accused Uber of “breaching the spirit” of its commitment to use local drivers, as well as misleading the authority. Uber is licensed to operate in 80 areas across the UK, having succeeded with 35 applications in the last year. The firm has complied with various initiatives in London to improve safety, and its appeal is due to be heard in the high court in June.Fresh concerns over Uber have emerged since TfL’s decison, including the disclosure of an attempted cover-up of a data breach in 2016 in which saw 57 million users’ details were leaked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480414.1525186938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"redacted text of note harris received about phelan case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tImage: Screenshot of PDF of note released by Government.The following is the redacted version of a briefing note about Vicky Phelan’s High Court case sent to Minister for Health Simon Harris on April 16th. It was released by the Government on May 1st.CervicalCheck: Patient claim following a diagnosis of cervical cancerBriefing Note for Minister HarrisA patient is taking a case against the HSE (National Screening Service CervicalCheck) and Med LabClinical Pathology Laboratories Ltd, the company providing cytopathology for CervicalCheck.In May 2011 the patient received cervical cancer screening through CervicalCheck no abnormalities were reported.A subsequent (routine) screening through CervicalCheck in June 2014 detected high-grade abnormalities and the patient was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014.The patient’s case is (i) that the 2011 screening test was falsely reported as negative and that the test was in keeping with a diagnosis of “query squamous cell carcinoma” and (ii) in relation to the non-disclosure of a CervicalCheck standard review process (clinical cancer audit) and of the outcome of this.The State Claims Agency (SCA) is managing the case on behalf of the HSE. It has advised that: i) liability for the 2011 screening test tests with the laboratory only (as per HSE contract with the lab, and as acknowledged by BLM solicitors, representing the lab)ii) the SCA is of the view that a claim for exemplary damages in relation to the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck standard review process is likely to failbe dropped, in the absence of any evidence of bad faith by the HSE in this regard.Mediation discussions between the patient and the laboratory were held on Monday 9th April. The SCA informed the Department that no agreement was reached the laboratory’s insurance company required complete confidentiality as a condition of any settlement and this was not acceptable to the plaintiff.Pre-trial discussions with a judge took piece on 10th and 12th April the matter may progress to the High Court on 19th April. The SCA has advised that they understand that BLM solicitors endeavour to settle the case on the best possible terms. in its view the case is likely to be settled shortly before going to court. The SCA is of the view that publicity around the case andor settlement is likely. CervicalCheck initiated a clinical cancer audit of the patient’s case, as per protocol for all notified cases of cervical cancer, in September 2014.The clinical cancer audit was closed in December 2014.At the time in 2014, the outcomes of clinical cancer audits were used by CervicalCheck for education and training purposes only. (See Appendices)BLM solicitors have shared a copy of an expert report with the SCA which we understand will form part of the laboratory’s defence in the context of liability and causation.The report was prepared by Tim D Feit, Member of the University of Wisconsin, Madison Cytotechnology Advisory Committee. The National Screening Service and Jerome Coffey, Head of the National Cancer Control Programme, have advised the Department in writing that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident but rather a reflection of the known limitations of the current screening test.A switch to HPV testing as the primary screening test in CervicalCheck has been approved and will be introduced in late 2018. The accuracy of primary HPV testing is significantly higher than the current liquid-based cytology testing and will therefore result in fewer women receiving a false negative result.The National Screening Service has assured the Department that no quality issues have arisen in relation to the US laboratory which performed the 2011 test. (Under current contractual arrangements with CervicalCheck, MedLab carry out their work through a laboratory in Ireland. )All laboratories that work with the programme, in addition to being accredited by national authorities, must comply with the programme’s quality assurance guidelines.CervicalCheck monitors the performance of inidual cytoscreeners on a regular basis to ensure that any variation in inidual practice is identified and followed up appropriately.When CervicalCheck is notified of a cervical cancer diagnosis a standardised review process (clinical cancer audit) is undertaken.The Department is in consultation with the HSE in regard to their preparation of a press statement on the matter.Suggested Quote for the Minister (if required following conclusion of legal proceedings)“I acknowledge the severe distress that this issue has caused to the patient involved, and to her family. Cancer screening programmes, offered through the National Screening Service, aim to detect cancer as early as possible, leading to better treatment options and outcomes for patients.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to the Border again and crossed it but first had to deny that the “backstop” option for the post-Brexit frontier was an EU land grab for Northern Ireland.The suggestion, in a question from a journalist with the pro-Brexit Daily , shows the extent to which the political noise in London around the negotiations on Britain’s departure is making Barnier’s job so difficult.“We have no intention of questioning the UK’s constitutional order,” Barnier told the All-Island Civic Forum on Brexit in Dundalk. “This is none of our business.”Almost two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and less than a year until its departure, nobody is any clearer about what Brexit means for the Border – and the temperature around Brexit is still too high to figure it out.Barnier, on his second visit to the Border since Brexit, said this was exactly why he had come to visit both sides of the Border: to find “technical and practical solutions to assure safety controls” that protect the EU’s single market and, he suggested, the UK’s internal market too.“We have to de-dramatise this point to avoid any kind of ideology,” he said.“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the European Union being interested in a land grab,” stressed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, sharing a stage with Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The clock is ticking down to the next critical deadline in the Brexit negotiations, the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of June, and the issue of how to maintain an invisible border remains unresolved.So far, the only solution on the negotiating table is the backstop, the default position that will effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market.It is an option the UK has agreed to and conceded should be covered by a legal text in the Brexit treaty, but it does not want it and has so far failed to agree to the legal text or proposed an alternative acceptable to the EU.In an attempt to keep the pressure on the British to come up with other concrete proposals, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney displayed a unified line of offence here near the Border. The three were “absolutely united,” the Taoiseach said, in seeking “meaningful progress” by the June summit.Barnier suggested June was a “stepping stone” to October’s deadline for a final Brexit treaty but warned that until there was agreement on an operational backstop, there was “a risk” of a disorderly Brexit.He inadvertently had a dig at Davis when he took a question from a Northern Irish journalist about Davis believing the backstop wasn’t necessary.“Who?” he asked, not quite catching the Northern accent. The backstop was there not to change the UK’s red lines (leaving the EU single market and customs union), he replied, but “because of the UK’s red lines”.The heaviest punches were thrown by Opposition politicians during the forum’s plenary session.Labour leader Brendan Howlin referred to the “civil war” that had erupted in the UK Tory party over Brexit. Independent Alliance Minister Shane Ross suggested that England’s difficulty should be Ireland’s opportunity.“If they insist on imposing this self-inflicted wound, it is probably something that we can take advantage of,” he said, pointing to the opportunities for financial services and tourism.While Barnier wants no drama, no visit to the Border area by anyone so connected with Brexit could avoid it.Hours before his visit, DUP leader Arlene Foster questioned Barnier’s honesty as a broker. He was “not ready to engage in polemics,” Barnier replied, calmly.For some hard Brexiteers, they do not seem ready to move beyond them.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480154.1525167423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lord kilclooney accused of racism after calling taoiseach typical indian","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLord Kilclooney claimed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar “constantly antagonises Unionist feelings and is damaging the improved NorthSouth relations”.Veteran unionist politician John Taylor, now Lord Kilclooney, has been accused of making racist remarks on social media after he referred to Leo Varadkar as a “typical Indian”.Responding to a tweet from BBC Newsline that featured the headline “DUP: Varadkar’s visit to Northern Ireland showed ‘disrespect’”, Lord Kilclooney tweeted on Monday afternoon the Taoiseach was a “typical Indian”. When asked to explain the term “typical Indian”, Lord Kilclooney wrote it was “typical of this particular half Indian”.He continued: “No Irish PM has previously ignored the normal courtesies of visiting the UK.The 80-year-old peer defended his use of the term Indian, saying Mr Varadkar was “racially a half Indian and proud of it” and that there was “nothing racist about it - simply factual”.He tweeted: “It is not racially abusive as he himself has confirmed he is half Indian. That is great and not to be dismissed as Indians are a great race. However he has damaged NorthSouth relations by being continually offensive and provocative to the Unionist majority in NIreland.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted that Lord Kilclooney’s language was “a racial slur, insulting of not only the Taoiseach and the Irish people, but of Indian people too. There is no explaining this one away like last time.”Ms Long called for the House of Lords to address Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour on social media. “It is deliberate, calculated disrespect,” she wrote.Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt also accused Lord Kilclooney of racist language, using the #NotInMyName in a tweet. Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile tweeted that he was planning to ask the Seanad Cathaoirleach to contact the Speaker of the House of Lords “urging him to take appropriate action regarding yet another offensive tweet from a member of the House of Lords regarding An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar”.DUP member Christopher Stalford tweeted: “I don’t know what John Taylor thinks he’s playing at but he doesn’t speak for me. Absolutely ridiculous behaviour.”Alliance Party councillor Emmet McDonough Brown tweeted that “reducing someone to their race denies their humanity \u0026amp agency and lays prejudice bare. Every generation has to stand against racism and this pound-shop bore should know better by now.”A spokesman for the House of Lords press office said Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour would only be investigated if they received complaints that he had breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct. If a complaint is raised, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards would undertake an independent investigation of the alleged breaches, he said. The House of Lords code of conduct states that members must always act “on their personal honour”. It notes that “members cannot rely simply on their own personal sense of what is honourable. They are required to act in accordance with the standards expected by the House as a whole”. The Taoiseach’s spokesman declined to comment on the matter.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480494.1525191082!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister advised phelan case likely to attract publicity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris was advised that publicity around Vicky Phelan’s High Court case was likely. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe The Minister for Health Simon Harris was advised by his officials prior to the hearing of the legal case taken by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan that it was likely to attract publicity.The Minister was told that the Department of Health was in consultation with the HSE regarding the preparation of a press statement on the case.The briefing note which was given to the Minister on April 16th was published on Tuesday by the Government under pressure from the Opposition in the Dáil who were seeking answers about the background to the current cervical screening controversy.The briefing note sets out the details of the claim taken by Ms Phelan.The controversy arose after Ms Phelan settled her action against a US laboratory, subcontracted by the CervicalCheck screening programme to assess the tests, without admission of liability for €2.5 million last week.Ms Phelan discovered that a 2011 smear test that had initially shown no abnormalities was, three years later, found to be inaccurate, but she was not told of the false test until September 2017. She is now suffering from terminal cancer.The briefing note drawn up by the cancer, blood and organs policy unit in the Department of Health advised the Minister of the background to the case and set out information on the screening programme and the audit process.It told the Minister that the case involved claims by Ms Phelan that the screening test she had in 2011 was falsely reported as negative and that separately she had not been told about a CervicalCheck standard review process – known as a clinical cancer audit – and its outcome.The Minister was advised that the State Claims Agency believed that “a claim for exemplary damages in relation to the non-disclosure of the Cervical Check standard review process is likely to failbe dropped in the absence of any evidence of bad faith by the HSE in this regard”.The Department of Health said the State Claims Agency also believed that the while the case was likely to be settled before going to court, that “publicity around the case andor settlement is likely”.The briefing note said that at the time the clinical cancer audits in question in the case, “were intended for use in supporting continuous process improvements and in supporting education and training only”.It said that: “In 2015 a decision was taken in the HSE, in line with best international practice, to provide information on outcomes of clinical cancer audits to treating clinicians for onward communication to patients as appropriate.”“The outcomes of all current and historical clinical cancer audits were subsequently communicated to treating clinicians in 2016 (including the case of Ms Phelan)”.It said that more recently women were informed of this audit process “and they have the option to request information on the outcomes of these reviews, which are sent to the treating doctor for discussion with the patient”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480521.1525191752!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world view podcast javid s appointment strengthens hard brexit wing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s home secretary Sajid Javid leaves after attending the weekly meeting of the cabinet at Downing Street in London.

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Uber has its licence removed in Brighton as three councillors who made the decision admitted to never using the appOED looks for words used worldwide to reflect global nature of English South Korea, China and Japan to hold summit, as Pyongyang starts removing propaganda speakers Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updateMozambique in drive to circumcise 100,000 men in effort to combat HIVEasyjet named best-value airline in UK - but where does BA rank?96-year-old Tory candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK Britain\u0026#39s most senior Catholic at odds with the Pope over Alfie Evans treatmentNUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Palestinian terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being suspended over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

Rational action, spared of emotion, can be an expression of love and I’m sure Alfie received this kind of care.It’s very hard to act in a child’s best interest when this isn’t always as the parents would wish – and this is why a court must decide what’s best, not for the parents, but for the child.Last month Pope Francis said he hoped Katie and Tom Evans\u0027 desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted. Via his Twitter account, he also said: It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.In a joint statement released on April 18, the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales praised the “professionalism and care for severely ill children” at the Liverpool hospital, and added: We know that recently reported public criticism of their work is unfounded as our chaplaincy care for the staff, and indeed offered to the family, has been consistently provided.Uber has its licence removed in Brighton as three councillors who made the decision admitted to never using the appOED looks for words used worldwide to reflect global nature of English South Korea, China and Japan to hold summit, as Pyongyang starts removing propaganda speakers Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updateMozambique in drive to circumcise 100,000 men in effort to combat HIVEasyjet named best-value airline in UK - but where does BA rank?96-year-old Tory candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK NUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Palestinian terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being suspended over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

But Venables has since been convicted and sent back to jail over indecent images of children.In February, he was jailed for three years and four months after admitting surfing the dark web for extreme child abuse images and possessing a sickening paedophile manual.He was charged after police found more than 1,000 indecent images on his computer. It was the second time he had been caught with such images and when he was arrested he told police he was plagued by stupid urges.James\u0027s mother, Denise Fergus, and father, Ralph Bulger, both attended the Old Bailey when Venables was sentenced in February.Law and orderUber has its licence removed in Brighton as three councillors who made the decision admitted to never using the appOED looks for words used worldwide to reflect global nature of English South Korea, China and Japan to hold summit, as Pyongyang starts removing propaganda speakers Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updateMozambique in drive to circumcise 100,000 men in effort to combat HIVEasyjet named best-value airline in UK - but where does BA rank?96-year-old Tory candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK Britain\u0026#39s most senior Catholic at odds with the Pope over Alfie Evans treatmentNUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Palestinian terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being suspended over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

But they also understand that lots of things need to develop a certain way, and then we can all be joyful together”.Despite the speakers being switched off, North Korean defectors in the South continued their campaign of sending water bottles filled with rice and K-pop-loaded USB sticks floating towards their homeland.Jung Gwang-il, a former North Korean political prisoner, and other activists tossed bottles into the sea from an island, hoping the tide will carry them northwards.What is one thing that Kim Jong Un hates the most? he asked. It\u0027s North Koreans becoming aware of the reality.Park Jung-oh, another defector, added: We all lived in North Korea for at least 30, 40 years so we know exactly what the people there want and need, Park said.When they watch the content of our USB sticks, they will realise that they have been tricked by their government, he said.Films and television programmes from abroad have long been banned in the North due to the regime’s fear that it will show its citizens the high living standards of foreigners, while travel abroad was impossible unless a person was willing to take their chances and defect.On Tuesday Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u0027s president, asked the United Nations to help verify North Korea\u0027s planned shutdown of its nuclear test site. Moon made the request in a phone call Tuesday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Yonhap news agency reported.Please review our commenting policyUber has its licence removed in Brighton as three councillors who made the decision admitted to never using the appOED looks for words used worldwide to reflect global nature of English Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the latest game updateMozambique in drive to circumcise 100,000 men in effort to combat HIVEasyjet named best-value airline in UK - but where does BA rank?96-year-old Tory candidate could become oldest councillor in the UK Britain\u0026#39s most senior Catholic at odds with the Pope over Alfie Evans treatmentNUS in row after women\u0026#39s toilets abolished at trans conferenceBritish ambassador to Israel filmed by Palestinian terrorist group during secret visit to Gaza borderHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?LIVE: Jamie Oliver discusses child obesity at select committee Four children murdered amid feud between their brother and arsonist who torched house, court hearsSpanking barrister takes firm to court after being suspended over BDSM session with colleague in a partner\u0026#39s office High earners most likely to hit the boozeWant to learn a foreign language fluently?

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It also helps both humans and animals to navigate, and protects our telecommunication and satellite systems.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field foundIf the two magnetic poles were to switch places, something that has happened periodically over the course of Earth’s history, all of this would be compromised.Since 1840, the year scientists began to measure such things, the global strength of the Earth’s magnetic field has been declining at a rate of around 5 per cent per century.This weakening, combined with the expansion of a particularly weak area in the planet’s magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to speculation that Earth’s magnetic fields were about to\u0026nbspreverse.The last time such a “geomagnetic reversal” or “excursion” happened was 780,000 years ago, but coverage of this phenomenon has suggested such an\u0026nbspevent is right around the corner.\u0026nbspAn extract from a book by journalist Alanna Mitchell was published on the science website Undark.The book was titled The Spinning Magnet: The Electromagnetic Force That Created the Modern World — and Could Destroy It, and the extract included a warning that it was “time to wake up to the dangers and start preparing” for a magnetic pole reversal.This warning was picked up with gusto and soon many other articles were popping up warning of the dangers of an imminent pole reversal.However, the new study suggests the worst of these fears may have been unwarranted.Based on the Earth’s history of flipping its magnetic field, something which can be calculated based on magnetics minerals in rocks, they think such an event is unlikely to happen any time soon.“There has been speculation that we are about to experience a magnetic polar reversal or excursion,” said Professor Richard Holme, a geomagnetism expert at the University of Liverpool.Why the Earth’s magnetic poles could be about to swap places – and how“However, by studying the two most recent excursion events, we show that neither bear resemblance to current changes in the geomagnetic field and therefore it is probably unlikely that such an event is about to happen.Our research suggests instead that the current weakened field will recover without such an extreme event, and therefore is unlikely to reverse.Instead, the scientists predict it may take thousands of years before Earth’s magnetic field reverses again.Scientists are certainly aware of the possibility that the Earth’s magnetic field will flip its polarity at some point in the future. As Nasa states in a post on its website from 2011: “Reversals are the rule, not the exception”.In the Undark extract, Ms Mitchell quotes physicist Dr Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, Boulder saying he fears parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during such a reversal.However, the consensus still seems to be that even if such an event did take place, its outcomes would not be as serious as some commentators have made out:“Many doomsday theorists have tried to take this natural geological occurrence and suggest it could lead to Earth\u0027s destruction,” Nasa continued in their post.“But would there be any dramatic effects? The answer, from the geologic and fossil records we have from hundreds of past magnetic polarity reversals, seems to be \u0027no.\u0027”Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cambridge Analytica insisted the Facebook data it received was obtained legally and that it was not used in the Brexit referendum.Mr Banks and Eldon Insurance have denied that the company shared any data with either Leave.EU or with Cambridge Analytica – and insisted the data consultancy did no work for its campaign.AIQ, meanwhile, says it has never been a part of either Cambridge Analytica or SCL, its parent firm, nor entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.However, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating both Leave.EU and Mr Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act, issuing “information notices” requiring specified cooperation.Her office also raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices, as part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum.A few days ago, Ms Denham publicly accused AIQ of failing to co-operate with her inquiry, saying: “We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.”Of the 87 Facebook users whose personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, more than one million live in the UK, the company has acknowledged.“One million people was the margin of the win in the Brexit referendum,” Ms Sandbach pointed out.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The verification provisions in the Iran nuclear deal would make it harder for Iran to restart any such research. That is another good reason for keeping the deal while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US and our other allies.”Under the 2015 nuclear deal struck by Iran and six major powers – Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Russia and China – Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for relief from crippling sanctions.Donald Trump has signalled he will pull out of the agreement, which he has called “the worst deal ever”, but he faces intense pressure from his European allies to stick with it.The US president gave Britain, France and Germany a deadline to fix what he views as the deal’s flaws – its failure to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites, and “sunset” clauses under which some of its terms expire – by 12 May, or he will reimpose US sanctions.Netanyahu says he believes Trump will make the correct decision about the Iran nuclear deal (Getty)On Monday, Mr Netanyahu stood in front of stacks of files representing what he said was a “half ton” of Iranian nuclear documents collected by Israeli intelligence.“Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons programme,” he said. “One hundred thousand secret files prove it did. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.”The White House said in a statement: “This information provides new and compelling details about Iran’s efforts to develop missile-deliverable nuclear weapons.“These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran had a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people.”An earlier statement by the White House made the extraordinary claim Iran “has” a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, before it was corrected due to what it said was a clerical error.Iran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it. A spokesman for the country’s foreign ministry called Mr Netanyahu’s performance a “threadbare charlatanism” show.The state-run IRNA news agency quoted the spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, as saying Mr Netanyahu’s speech was part of “fruitless efforts of a bankrupt and scandalous liar”.France and Germany also confirmed they will continue to back the nuclear agreement. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish. It wasn’t the biggest shock to them.Again this description seems at odds with the portrait of the naïve and lonely girl that Jade also likes to paint of her past self.Either way, today Jade likes to think of herself as an entrepreneur as well as a porn performer.She has given up travelling to shoots and instead works from her Manchester flat creating her own content, which she sells to subscribers.I work three days a week from my own home and while I’m not rich I’m not poor. For me it’s not about the money, she says. It’s about doing something I enjoy.Is there a sell-by date on what she does? Who knows?, she asks. I live each day by the day. What about regret in the future? After all, the 60-year-old Jade might feel differently about what she did as a young girl.Maybe but I don’t think so, she says. I like to think that I’ll enjoy seeing how hot I was.I am proud of what I do. I honestly think that discovering the porn industry made me the person I am today, and I couldn’t be more grateful.Jade features in Jade: Why I Chose Porn on BBC iPlayer and Things Not To Say To Someone Who Works In Porn on BBC Three’s YouTube channelOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinets 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It stated: “This is very effective.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough. I don’t think anyone else should interfere.”Dr Goodall told Seven News: My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide.Controversial euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke said his organisation, Exit International, was assisting Professor Goodall to travel business class to the clinic.Dr Goodall has been a member of the group for almost 20 years and will fly out of Perth on Wednesday.One of the organisations nurses, Carol O’Neil, will accompany him to the Life Circle in Basel, Switzerland, which has been able to fast track him.Exit International started a GoFundMe campaign, which had raised more than $18,5000 by Tuesday.Dr Nitschke, who burnt his practising certificate in 2015 to protest against Medical Board conditions on his registration, said it was a shame Dr Goodall had to undertake an arduous trip to have a peaceful death at the time of his choosing.The centenarian made international headlines in 2016 when his university reversed a decision to kick him out of his office on campus amid concerns his long public transport commute was a health risk.Considered a leading botanist and ecologist, Prof Goodall was born in Edmonton, London, in 1914.He received his PhD from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in the capital in 1941 before emigrating to Australia in 1948, where took up a post at the University of Melbourne.David was awarded a Doctor of Science from Melbourne University as well as an honorary doctorate from the Università degli Studí di Trieste  in Italy. He held a range of academic positions in the UK, US and Australia (CSIRO ) before retiring in 1979.After his retirement, he edited the 30 volume series of Ecosystems Of The World with over 500 authors.Dr Goodall has produced more than 100 research papers in an ecology career spanning 70 years.He celebrated his 104th birthday earlier this month and has since made the decision to travel to Switzerland where voluntary euthanasia is legal.A version of this article appeared originally appeared on news.auIf you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans on (free) 116123 or 020 7734 2800.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That included:Ministers only lost one vote on the EU withdrawal Bill in the Commons - when 11 Tory rebels voted in favour of a change which would only allow ministers to use powerful statutory instruments to change law if Parliament voted in favour of the withdrawal deal first.Many of these amendments are tricky for the Government because it means handing over more powers to MPs and Lords to dictate our EU exit and what it will look like.Last nights changes - if they are accepted by MPs - would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving without a deal, and could keep us in altogether.It would mean that Parliament has the power to decide what happens if MPs turn down the final arrangement that David Davis and Michel Barnier strike.Critics say this is ignoring the will of the 17 million Brits who voted for Brexit.Ministers said it could even risk weakening the UKs hand in negotiations - because the EU know that they will have to get MPs to pass it at the end of the day. Lords have another day to debate amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill tomorrow, on May 2.Then it will return to the Commons for MPs to consider the changes.But the Government are sure to try and overturn them, and it could result in a game of ping pong between the two Houses as t hey fight over the wording.When it has been agreed by both the Commons and the Lords, its ready for Royal Assent and will officially become law when we quit the EU.But if they dont agree on it, the Bill could fail totally.In that case, the Commons could use an Act of Parliament to pass the Bill without the consent of the Lords.Only seven have become law under this procedure - and a further three were set to do so but the Lords eventually caved in.Ministers could also try invoke the Salisbury Convention - which ensures that Government Bills can get through the Lords when they have no majority there - because it was a promise mentioned in an election manifesto. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ms Judd held firm, saying, No, when I win. And then she fled the scene.Judd said the first time she became aware of why Sir Peter failed to cast her was when he spoke about the decision last year as dozens of women publicly accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.Weinstein, 66, is being investigated by police in London, New York and Los Angeles. He has apologised for his past behaviour but denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.A spokeswoman for Weinstein refuted the claims of Judd and Sir Peter and said the shamed producer would launch a vigorous defence.The most basic investigation of the facts will reveal that Mr Weinstein neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judds career, and instead not only championed her work but also repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies over the next decade, she said.After the lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles on Monday, Judd said she would donate any damages won to the Times Up initiative and its legal defence fund to help women fight sexual harassment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My skin peels off and, at times, there is bleeding.“All I can do is watch children my age play and enjoy their life.”Vedika, from Indore in India, spends her time alone studying, painting and watching TV as she doesn’t have any friends.Her family have taken her to several doctors but none have been able to provide her with a cure.She has to cover herself in moisturiser several times a day to stop her skin from cracking, flaking and bleeding.Vedika’s older sister Sunidhi, 20, also suffers from the condition and is so self-conscious about her looks she doesn’t go outside.Their aunts also suffer from the genetic condition.“My elder daughter who also has the same skin disorder keeps herself confined in her room,” said mum Madhuri Gupta.“She is now a grown woman conscious about her looks and appearance. Hence, she avoids socialising, interacting with people or even coming in front of the camera.”Desperate for a cure the sisters turned to alternative treatments, which only made their skin worse.Then they heard about the plight of Shalini Yadav, an Indian teenager whose lamellar ichthyosis was cured by treatment in Spain.They are now crowdfunding for the same medication, which doctors say will be available in India.“All I want is that my daughters dont suffer the same way like me in the future, giving birth to babies with similar disorders, there should be a treatment,” Madhuri said.“At home, I keep my daughters in comfort, but outside the struggle that they face, I cannot do anything about it.”Vedika hopes the new treatment will change her life.“Everyone has treated me equally, but yes when I speak to some stranger then I feel a little uncomfortable,” she said.“If I get help like Shalini got, I can also lead a life of dignity.“If there is any treatment that helps improve my skin condition by 50 per cent, it will give my confidence a boost.”You can donate to their cause at their fundraising page here.The skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin and are not shed as quickly as they should be.The result of this retention is the formation of scales.Symptoms:Signs of the condition will be present at birth.Babies are often covered with a clean membrane and have dark red, tight skin.Often the eyelids and lips are forced open by the tightness.Babies also can experience problems with temperature regulation, water loss and secondary infections.People with lamellar ichthyosis often have trouble closing their eyes completely because of the tightness of the skin around the eyes and eyelids.In some cases, the skin around the eyes pulls so tightly it causes they eyelids to turn outward exposing the inner red lid and causing continuous irritation.The dry skin builds up so much that suffers shed skin on a daily basis.Treatment:Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin.Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids.Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.There is no known cure, but several clinical studies are active around the world."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0004025960991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory power pose stance sajid javid theresa may george osborne","story":"New home secretary Sajid Javid is the latest to be mocked for striking the Tory power pose. Heres what you need to know.The power stance is a pose adopted by the Tories standing with legs apart and arms at their side.A number of senior Conservative politicians have chosen this particularly bizarre way to stand.The strange cowboy pose has also been dubbed the Beyoncé after the Single Ladies singers famous dance moves.The origin of the stance in politics is thought to be a scientific study in 2010 that claimed those standing like that were projecting power.But lead author Professor Dana Carney of California University has since admitted it does not work.She said the “evidence has been mounting” suggesting there is unlikely to be an effect “on internal or psychological outcomes”Adding: “As such, I do not believe ‘power pose’ effects are real.” George Osborne was first to adpot the pose at the Tory party conference in Manchester in 2015 when he appeared on stage with his legs wide apart.Body language experts said the then Chancellor could have been trying to take up space to appear strong.But his advisers must have forgotten to tell him not to turn his feet inwards, so he ended up looking like a child on a skiiing lesson.Despite widespread ridicule of Mr Osbornes stance, Theresa May - then Home Secretary - copied the pose at the same conference.And the following year PM David Cameron was pictured with legs spread like John Wayne during a Sky News debate on Brexit. The much-mocked Tory power stance was thought to have been put to bed after it had not been seen for nearly two years.But Mr Javid resurrected it when he posed for the press on his first day in charge at the Home Office.The new Home Secretary spread his legs way too far apart with his arms straight by his sides - apparently trying to look powerful.But everyone else thought he looked silly and the inevitable Twitter jokes rolled in.Mr Javid was compared to Cristiano Ronaldo lining up to take a free kick, and to Hugh Lauries foppish Prince Regent performing the “heroic stance” in BBC sitcom Blackadder.Others said he looked like guitar-thrashing rockers Status Quo, while one meme placed him in the line-up of newly reformed Abba.And over a montage of four Tories adopting the pose, Twitter user Dean Burnett joked: Want to feel old?

And this is true across the animal kingdom - its not limited to primates - and humans do the same thing.When we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite.We close up and make ourselves small.But its not just about projecting power over other people - Amy says we can fake it till we make it and convince ourselves that we are more confident and dominant just by consciously adopting a bold power stance.When you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful, she explains.Powerful people tend to be more assertive, confident and optimistic, and they take more risks.The body can shape the mind. In her own research, Amy has taken groups of people and asked them to adopt high or low-power poses, without telling them why.The famous legs-spread Tory stance is an example of a high-power pose, while low-power poses could include seated positions with the limbs tucked in.After two minutes in this pose, subjects were asked to play a gambling game, and the choices of the high-power and low-power groups were compared.Cuddy found that 85 per cent of the people primed by just two minutes in a power pose were prepared to take risks, while just 60 per cent of the low-power group took the same risks.By swabbing the mouth before and after a two-minute pose, researchers also found that testosterone, the male sex hormone associated with physical strength, increases by 20 per cent after adopting a high-power pose.This is true of both men and women, meaning anyone can gain a rush of masculine power just by standing with your legs spread.And on the flip side, testosterone levels tend to dip by around 10 per cent after two minutes spent in a low-power pose.Meanwhile, cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, decrease after a few minutes in a dominant pose, and rise after taking a cowering, submissive pose.In another test, Cuddy put a group of people through a mock job interview, with half of the group spending a few minutes in a power pose before they went in, and the other half adopting a low-power pose while waiting for the interview to start.She found that the people who had prepared with a power pose were more likely to get positive feedback from the test interview - suggesting that power stances can be useful to boost your own confidence, as well as to project your confidence to the world.By taking an exaggerated Javid-style power stance (sometimes dubbed the Wonder Woman pose) before you go into a meeting or give a speech you can improve your own confidence and presence.It can also make you come across as more comfortable, passionate and authentic - which explains why its so popular among big-name politicians.However, Cuddy explains that youre not necessarily meant to strike this exaggerated power pose while youre delivering a big speech - as Tory ministers are prone to doing.Its more something which you should do for yourself, in private, to gee yourself up before a big event.As Cuddy says: For two minutes before you go into a high-stress situation, try doing this: in an elevator, in a bathroom stall or at your desk, behind closed doors.Configure your brain to do the best in that situation and get your testosterone up.Of course, you dont have to be a government minister to benefit from this psychological boost - anyone can try a few minutes of power posing before a stressful or intimidating event.Just take a moment to privately adopt a big, space-hogging Alpha pose, and youll find that youre that bit more calm and composed when it comes to crunch time.Cuddy says: Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. You dont just fake it till you make it, you can actually fake it until you become it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You wouldnt want to go through this.Charlies mum Connie replied: Were not really thinking about having a child right now.All of this is really important to us - we cant bring Charlie back, but we can try to help people in the future, or other people here now, thats our focus right now.Well think about it a bit further down the line - we cant wait til I get too old obviously.Partner Chris added: We havent had time to think about it.The couple, who are also trying to change the way hospitals and families interact when making decisions about the future of children, said they were focusing on Charlies Law.Charlies parents say the proposed law would address problems around the “best interests” test used by courts to decide what is best for the child rather than the parents.It would also increase transparency so that cases can be dealt with before they reach the courts.Speaking this morning, Chris Gard said his heart went out to the family of Alfie Evans, saying: No one will be in more pain than they are in now.From a personal experience, obviously I do this day, nine months later, I can get very angry at the world and at life.I can get extremely upset - but my overwhelming feeling, and I imagine Tom feels it as well, is pride.Charlie was our little boy.He touched the hearts of people around the world, and so did Alfie.Alfies parents are also campaigning to have a change made to the law after losing their little boy.Alfies Law would give parents more power over choosing care for their sick children.Currently, if a public body considers that a parents choices risk harming a child, it can challenge them in court.Doctors and social workers can ask a judge for an order to override the legal state of parental responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds monopoly man jumps over counter","story":"In the footage, the man can be seen grabbing the roll of vouchers before bolting from the London branch.The annual competition run by the fast food chain from March 21 to May 1 allows customers to receive a Double or Triple Game Piece which consists of two or three stickers, some of which are an online game sticker while others are an instant win like free food or a drink.Big prizes from the game also include £100K in cash, a Mini Cooper, a trip to Universal Florida, an XBox One games console amongst other items.While its unclear when it was filmed, the shameless thief jumps the counter with his hood pulled up and grabs the roll - just feet away from McDonalds staff.He then hops back over - dressed in a dark top, grey tracksuit, trainers and carrying a backpack - and sprints through the restaurant towards the door as his friend recording the video laughs in the background and customers look on.At the end of the clip, the stolen tickets are then boldly showed off.A McDonalds spokesperson told The Sun Online: “We take criminal activity like this very seriously.All of our Monopoly game pieces are traceable and as such any prizes won by unlawful means will not be redeemable.” The clip has emerged just a day after The Sun Online reported the shocking moment a McDonalds worker slapped a customer at a Camberwell branch after the female customer flicked her in the head for being rude.In the clip, the female customer gets into an argument with the staff when her fast food order takes too long – ending in the McDonald’s employee hitting her several times and pulling her by the hair. A spokesperson for McDonalds told The Sun Online: “We take matters like this extremely seriously and do not tolerate violence in any form, either from customers or our crew.We are investigating this incident as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402773023-e1525182372264.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tots tv cottatge 20 years later","story":"In a stark contrast to its 1990s glory days, the Warwickshire set has fallen into disrepair with a rotting roof, missing roof timbers and broken floorboards.A video showing the former TV set was captured by Lewis Cooper, from East Sussex, who tracked down the secret location in Warwickshire, in March 2017.He said: I spent several hours searching the web as at the time the location was kept far more secret.I had found several clues online and eventually found it by finding landmarks that I knew were nearby on Google maps and narrowed it down to the small area where the house is located.We found that the famous red door at the front of the house had been removed and was nowhere to be found.This was quite sad to see as it was an iconic part of the house.Production of the Tots TV television show ended in 1998 and it was famous for its three main characters, ragdoll friends, Tilly, Tom and Tiny.Lewis said: There were a lot of wires and electronics in the production area behind the house but these had all be completely destroyed by the water that flooded the room.There are no floorboards in the house. Tots TV was filmed in such a way that the floor was rarely shown on camera.This allowed for hatches to be built into the floor so that the puppeteers could hide below.I mainly had a sense of nostalgia when I saw the set.I remember watching Tots TV on VHS tapes when I was younger and I would never have thought that I would visit the filming location one day.It was also sad to see it in this state, I have had many people comment on my video that feel the same way and have even called for it to be restored and turned into some sort of attraction."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378340145.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british kfc worker told he was being deported to uganda even though hed never left the uk in his life","story":"Kyle Herbert, 22, was born in Shrewsbury, has lived in the town his whole life and doesn’t even have a passport.But Kyle was sent a letter warning him that he was being sent to East Africa - and his bosses at KFC suspended him from work because they were told he was an illegal immigrant.Eventually Home Office workers had to admit they’d made a mistake, saying they had no clue how it happened.Mr Herbert is speaking out about his ordeal - which took place in 2015, when Theresa May was Home Secretary - in the wake of the Windrush scandal which saw dozens of British citizens wrongly threatened with deportation.He told MailOnline: “I was at work and my manager called me over and said that the UK Border Agency had rang. They told her that I was wanted by the Home Office for deportation.“She told me that she had to suspend me because they had told her that that they could be prosecuted and fined if they kept me on the books.”It then took him several days to get through to the Home Office - leaving him unable to work during that time.He said that when he got through, “I explained the situation. I was hysterical. I told him that the idea of me being deported to Uganda was ridiculous.“I was passed on to a manager who said that they had no idea how or why it had happened.”Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary on Sunday night in the wake of the Windrush generation crisis.Today it was claimed that up to 7,000 foreign students may have been wrongly accused of cheating and kicked out of Britain.A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Mr Herbert was sent a letter in May 2015 incorrectly warning that he was the subject of enforcement action.“When the mistake was identified in October 2015, we wrote to Mr Herbert to acknowledge the error and apologise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402206917.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pension watchdog faces calls to investigate sainsburys tie up with asda to stop workers being left out of pocket","story":"Labour’s Frank Field called on Sainsbury’s chief Mike Coupe - panned for singing We’re in the Money over the deal – to prove that staff won’t be left out of pocket once the merger is complete.And he said the regulator also had to be given a veto on the historic supermarket deal.Speaking to The Sun, Mr Field, head of the cross-party Commons Work and Pension Committee said: “The living standard of hundreds of thousands of worker and pensioners are on the line.“Given that both companies’ pension schemes have significant accounting deficits, it seems to be as clear as day that the deal should proceed only once it’s been cleared by The Pensions Regulator.”The Labour campaigner said Sainsbury’s had a near £1billion black hole in its pension scheme while Asda’s was almost £900million in the red.Sainsbury’s is washing its hands of Asda’s scheme under the merger plans – with the obligation for funding Asda retirement pots left with former owner, US giant Walmart.Walmart will get £3billion in cash under the merger.In a letter to Mike Coupe, Mr Field asks if there is any specific provision under the deal to include a “specific provision” for Sainsbury’s pension scheme members.And he asks: “What risk analysis have you undertaken regarding the deal’s impact on the covenant underpinning the Sainsbury’s defined benefit regimes?”Frank Field’s Commons Ccmmittee went to war with Sir Philip Green over the collapse of BHS. The billionaire in February agreed to write a £363million cheque to shore up the high street chain’s pension fund.Last month, the Government dropped plans to give the Pensions Regulator power to stop mergers or takeovers that threaten the solvency of a UK retirement fund. The power would have worked in a similar way to the “fit and proper person” test applied by the Football Association on foreign takeovers of English clubs.Explaining the U-turn, Government sources explained that Ministers had sought to strike a balance between supporting pensioners and allowing British companies to “grow and prosper”.Mr Coupe was caught singing We’re in the Money on TV as Sainsbury’s shares soared 17 per cent on the merger plan with long-time rival Asda.The chief exec didn’t realise his rendition of the Gold Diggers’ Song was being recorded by ITV. Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself before an interview on ITV about the merger.It came as critics claimed the merger could lead to widespread store closures and job losses – as well as a thumping for suppliers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He shouldn’t just do that, it’s a matter for the police.”A spokeswoman for Costa Coffee told The Sun Online it was investigating the incident and that the man had been suspended.She said: “We were extremely disappointed to see this behaviour from one of our baristas and have apologised to the family.An immediate investigation was launched by our franchise partner and remains ongoing."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402836279.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ebay openly selling magnet tools shoplifters use to remove security tags from clothes for as little as 3","story":"The tools - known as magnetic bullets - are disguised to look like miniature torches and can be attached to key-rings.They feature powerful magnets which sellers claim can disable stores’ security measures in seconds.They range in price from £2.72 to over £14.In a listing on the auction website one seller boasts: “The variety of security tags is so large I cannot possible list every variety.“It does not work on every security tag.“I cannot be held responsible if you cannot open a tag not shown in the listing.“If you cannot open a tag I will be able to explain how to use the detacher.In the majority of cases if you cannot work the detacher it is because you are using it incorrectly.”When approached by The Sun eBay removed the items from sale.A spokesperson said: “We work closely with law enforcement authorities and sellers to make sure we have the right restrictions in place and we have banned the sale of these types of item on our platform.“Listings that don’t comply with our policies will be removed.”It comes as The Sun revealed this week how video-sharing giant YouTube was found to be hosting shoplifting tutorials.One shoplifting video, viewed 202,125 times, showed how to line a bag with foil and clingfilm so that security tags did not trigger alarms.It stated: This is very effective. Now you can go and steal as much as you can.In February a shoplifter boasted he went on a stealing spree after watching a video tutorial on YouTube.Joseph Burwood, 22, targeted four stores at Clarks Village in Street, Somerset. He told JPs he wanted to give it a go.Burwood got a 12-month conditional discharge.Shoplifting costs the economy more than £6billion a year.
