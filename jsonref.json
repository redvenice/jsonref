On Friday, their fate was still uncertain, with conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble. Communications are disrupted across the city and movement is difficult because of shelling and fighting.‘We hope and we think that some people who stayed in the shelter under the theatre could survive,’ Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor’s office, told the Associated Press on Thursday. He said the building had a relatively modern, basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes. Other officials said earlier that some people had gotten out.Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed the at least three-story building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed. Satellite imagery on Monday from Maxar Technologies showed huge white letters on the pavement outside the theatre spelling out ‘CHILDREN’ in Russian to alert warplanes to the vulnerable people hiding inside.Russia’s military denied bombing the theatre or anyplace else in Mariupol on Wednesday.In Chernihiv, at least 53 people were brought to morgues over 24 hours, killed amid heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday.Ukraine’s emergency services said a mother, father and three of their children, including three-year-old twins, were killed when a Chernihiv hostel was shelled. Civilians were hiding in basements and shelters across the embattled city of 280,000.‘The city has never known such nightmarish, colossal losses and destruction,’ Chaus said.Ukraine’s comic-turned-wartime leader Volodymyr Zelensky said early on Friday he was thankful to President Joe Biden for additional military aid, but he would not get into specifics about the new package, saying he did not want Russia to know what to expect.He said when the invasion began on February 24, Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when Russia seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region.Instead, he said, Ukraine had much stronger defences than expected, and Russia ‘didn’t know what we had for defence or how we prepared to meet the blow’.In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies accused Putin of conducting an ‘unprovoked and shameful war’, and called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.Both Ukraine and Russia this week reported some progress in negotiations. Zelensky said he would not reveal Ukraine’s negotiating tactics.‘Working more in silence than on television, radio or on Facebook,’ Zelensky said. ‘I consider it the right way.’Putin spoke by phone on Friday with German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who urged the Russian president to agree to an immediate cease-fire and called for an improvement to the humanitarian situation, a spokesman for Scholz said.In a statement about the call, the Kremlin said Putin told the German chancellor that Ukraine had ‘unrealistic proposals’ and was dragging out negotiations. The Kremlin also said it was evacuating civilians, and accused Ukraine of committing war crimes by shelling cities in the east.While details of Thursday’s talks were unknown, an official in Zelensky’s office told the AP that on Wednesday, the main subject discussed was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would be.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Ukraine was insisting on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations and on legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine.In exchange, the official said, Ukraine was ready to discuss a neutral military status.Russia has demanded that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine to the alliance or station forces there.The fighting has led more than 3million people to flee Ukraine, the UN estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.  "},{"url":null,"title":"No10 staff told prepare general election autumn 2023","story":"Share this article Intended to be policy-light, Mr Sunak has been under huge pressure to include measures to help low and middle-income households being clobbered by soaring energy bills, record fuel prices and a hike in National Insurance. Speaking at the party\u0027s Spring conference in Blackpool, the Chancellor insisted he had \u0027enormous sympathy\u0027 for people being hammered by soaring inflation and energy costs.But he defended the eye-watering national insurance rise and tax threshold freezes due to take effect next month, saying the government needed to do \u0027difficult\u0027 things to get the public finances under control.However, one MP told the Telegraph that Mr Sunak had \u0027considered resigning\u0027 over the planned rise in National Insurance contributions and that his relationship with Boris Johnson had \u0027completely disintegrated\u0027.Mr Johnson was said to have considered scrapping the National Insurance hike earlier this year to stop Tory MPs sending letters of no confidence in his leadership amid ongoing reports of parties in Downing Street.Eventually, he faced down mounting opposition to the 1.25 percentage point tax rise by insisting, alongside Mr Sunak, it was the \u0027right plan\u0027 and it would go ahead in April.In a joint article, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak said: \u0027We must go ahead with the health and social care levy.\u0027Mr Sunak has vowed that he will \u0027prioritise\u0027 cutting taxes in the coming years, stressing his own Thatcherite outlook.But he played down the prospect of major steps today arguing that factors like global inflation are \u0027somewhat out of my control\u0027.Interviewed on stage in Blackpool by local Tory MP Paul Maynard, Mr Sunak said: \u0027It is about taking stock of the situation which, of course, is difficult.\u0027I can see that, and I have enormous sympathy for what people are going through at the moment and that\u0027s why we will always be there to help make a difference where we can.\u0027I can\u0027t solve every problem, no government can solve every problem, particularly when you are grappling with global inflationary forces – they are somewhat out of my control.\u0027But as you saw a month or so ago when we announced the very significant intervention to help people meet some of the additional costs of energy bills, where we can make a difference, of course I can – I\u0027m always going to do that, we\u0027ve done it over the last two years.\u0027So, we will have an update on the situation and a little bit of a look forward to where we are heading.\u0027 Mr Sunak said it had been necessary to put up taxes to rebuild the public finances following the Covid-19 outbreak, but suggested there would not be more increases.\u0027That is done. We have made the difficult decisions that we had to make. My priority going forward is to cut taxes. I made that very clear at the Budget,\u0027 he said.Mr Sunak defended the rises he had introduced, saying it would not have been \u0027economically responsible\u0027 not to have addressed the problems caused by the pandemic.\u0027I did not get into this to have to put up people\u0027s taxes.

On this day in 1994, Eric Cantona mistook John Moncur for a tap dance mat. And on the same day, Ian Wright flaunted his goalscoring genius. The second goal is a gem. This is well worth your time. Lots of Derby pressure at the staart of the second half. They’ve already had a decent penalty appeal turned down and now they had a free-kick right on the edge of the D. Tom Lawrence hoofs it straight into the wall.Napoli will go top, for a few hours at least, if they win this afternoon. The leaders AC Milan are at Cagliari tonight. Coventry, who are 11th in the Championship but still right in the mix for promotion, lead at Derby through a quite brilliant goal from Matt Godden. Pick this out. There’s another lunchtime kick-off in the Championship at Bramall Lane, where the half-time score is Sheffield United 0-0 Barnsley.Bukayo Saka’s goal has given Arsenal the lead at Villa Park.

Staff working on that route had believed their job was “as safe as a house,” he said.Mr O’Donoghue said he believed the move from the company was an attempt to “get rid of unionised staff”.Protests were held at a number of ports on Friday, including Larne, over the decision to sack staff, with trade unions calling for a boycott of the company.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nuns sold donnybrook convent in deal that put conservative 20m valuation on site","story":"The Dominican College at Muckross Park in Donnybrook, Dublin 4:  the Muckross Park House site is next to and shares an entrance with Muckross Park College. Photograph: Matt KavanaghDominican nuns sold their former convent in Donnybrook to property developers in a deal that potentially put a “conservative” €20 million valuation on the Dublin 4 site. The transaction last year has come to light in a planning submission to Dublin City Council by the new owners of the 1.19-hectare property off Marlborough Road, who want it zoned for housing in what would be considered a prime location. The Muckross Park House site is next to and shares an entrance with Muckross Park College, one of the best known secondary schools for girls in the south city. The last remaining nuns left the site three years ago, ending their presence for 120 years on property the Dominicans acquired in 1900 for £4,000. Muckross Park House and its surrounding lands are now owned by a company, Reilly Lands 2012 SPV, whose directors Gerald McGreevy and Seán McGreevy are based in Co Down. Neither the directors nor the Congregation of Dominican Sisters replied to calls from The . But the sale was set out in a letter to Seán McGreevy from Sr Martina Phelan, prioress of the congregation, included in the company’s recent submission to the city council on its draft development plan. Current valuations “I can confirm on behalf of the order that the subject property, comprising the former Dominican convent at Muckross Park House, Marlborough Road, is no longer required by the Dominican Sisters for the purposes of our functions and mission.”According to a senior professional in the property sector, current valuations put a potential price of “€20 million-plus” on the site even without residential zoning. The site of almost 1.2 hectares extends to some 2.94 acres, and such property has fetched between €5 million and €7 million per acre in recent times. In its submission to the council, Reilly Lands 2012 SPV said the proposed “community and social infrastructure” zoning on the site was “no longer appropriate” and called for “residential neighbourhoods” zoning instead. “This would allow for an integrated residential development with ample public open space for a well-located site that complies with relevant compact development and brownfield development objectives.”The company is a subsidiary of McGreevy Investment Holdings Ltd of Dundalk, Co Louth, whose ultimate controlling party is Gerald McGreevy. The parent company had retained earnings of €37.6 million in November 2020, according to its most recent accounts. In a surging property market, the Muckross Park deal is another example of a Catholic religious order selling off valuable real estate in its ownership for generations. As priests, nuns and brothers age and vocations decline, the Jesuit and Carmelite orders as well as the Spiritan congregation and the Order of St Augustine have been linked to multimillion-euro land sales. Church bodies have long ranked among the largest and most sophisticated real estate owners in Ireland, with extensive holdings throughout the State. Although the disposal of church lands has been a feature of the sector for decades, sales in recent years have coincided with rising valuations as the housing market goes through another boom.

The Norbank is set to resume sailings on the Liverpool-Dublin route  on Saturday evening. Photograph: Getty At least 60 employees who lost their jobs when P\u0026ampO Ferries sacked them on Thursday are from Ireland, their trade union has stated.Maritime union, Nautilus International, official Mickey Smyth said he estimated that 25 workers from the Republic and 35 from the North are among the 800 who were dismissed without notice on Thursday.Most work on the European Causeway vessel which sails between Larne and Cairnryan.The workers affected were employed by a hiring agency in Jersey and are subject to UK law.Mr Smyth said the workers on the P\u0026ampO Ferries ferry between Liverpool and Dublin are not affected as they are employed under Dutch law.The Norbank left Dublin Port at 7.30am on Saturday morning for a scheduled sailing and is due back from Liverpool tonight.“The Dutch obviously have different employment laws and they are protected. It is not part of the dispute. The other vessels are chartered vessels which are impacted,” he said.Mr Smyth said he hoped the Irish Government would intervene to persuade P\u0026ampO Ferries to change its mind.The British government has said it is unhappy with the decision and is investigating the legalities of it.Mr Smyth added that he felt the actions of P\u0026ampO Ferries copied the example of Irish Ferries which sacked 543 workers and replaced them with cheaper foreign workers.P\u0026ampO Ferries terminated the employment by conference call on Thursday. They are being replaced by cheaper agency staff.The decision has caused outrage among unions and politicians in the UK and there have been calls for the boycott of the ferry company.P\u0026ampO Ferries, which transports passengers and freight, operates four routes: Dover to Calais Hull to Rotterdam Liverpool to Dublin and Cairnryanto Larne.It has 2,200 employees remaining in the UK and began operating ferries in the 1960s.In a letter to staff Mr Hebblethwaite said P\u0026ampO Ferries was losing £100 million a year and had to change its business model.The Norbank is a Dutch-flagged vessel crewed by Dutch officers and Filipino crew.Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson expressed the union’s anger at this move by the company, and warned there was a clear threat to public safety posed by agency crew.“Clearly, we are outraged by this suggestion. We call on the public to boycott P\u0026ampO Ferries and to not travel with this shameful business,” he said.“We ask the government to act in support of loyal UK seafarers, and we demand to know how its vessels can run with agency crew who are unfamiliar with the vessel.”His union tweeted: “P\u0026ampO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite reckons the Liverpool-Dublin route will restart today. Nautilus demands to know how the vessels can run with agency crew unfamiliar with the ship? The government must urgently inspect the vessel and make its report public.”Liverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne tweeted: “I’m sure the good folk of Liverpool and Dublin will boycott this scab vessel if it restarts today.

So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Up to 100 feared dead after Russia strikes Ukrainian barracks Cricket in the cold is the most likely time for a leg breakRussia uses \u0026#39invincible\u0026#39 hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for the first timeMurder investigation launched after woman, 19, found dead in LondonBritish volunteer fighters may have triggered deadly strike on Ukrainian base after their phones were detectedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anglophobia helped drive scotland","story":"Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, may seem an odd place to be flagging up the thorny issue of anti-English racism.A rural middle-class constituency with a large air base at RAF Lossiemouth and barracks at Kinloss, it is surely a community accustomed to incomers, especially from the south.Represented by the SNP at Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster, by Scottish party leader Douglas Ross, Moray is also relatively civilised politically. Even its council is a blend, with the minority SNP administration working (just about) alongside the Conservatives.But it was in Moray this week that Anglophobia reared its ugly head. During a committee meeting about Islamophobia, a Tory councillor said she received more complaints from English residents, made to feel unwelcome by Scots, than from any other minority group.Anglophobia is there all the time, said Claire Feaver. Numerous constituents over the past five years have come to me asking what we’re going to do about this.Scotland prides itself on its egalitarian reputation, it has been quick in the recent Ukrainian humanitarian crisis to pledge support for refugees, and the government is pro-immigration. But there are big holes in its hospitality.Under 15 years of Nationalist rule and an increasingly isive debate over Scottish independence, there is no escaping the fact that Anglophobia is the embarrassing by-product of devolution.While the SNP’s official line is to denounce anti-English prejudice, there are no sanctions for those in the movement who can’t keep their hatred in check.The pandemic offered an insight into how this might play out in the event of independence, with the closing of borders, the restrictions on travel and the separatist warning to England to stay away lest it infect its neighbour.Saltire-waving loons on bridges over the A1 became a backdrop to Nationalist xenophobia, and SNP politicians, taking their lead from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, embraced strict lockdowns that kept the English in Scotland apart from their families. For me, this was probably the last straw and after living in Scotland for 25 years, I moved, with my Scottish husband, back to London just before Christmas.The motivation was personal – to be closer to our grown-up children – but there is no doubt that politics played a part too.The country I migrated to in 1996 was a different world from the place I’ve just left. This was on the eve of the devolution experiment, which was supposed to nip nationalism in the bud, and we witnessed the creation of the new parliament and the dawn of a political renaissance.Back then, we had friends from across the political spectrum and many a night at our dinner table we entertained SNP, Labour and Tory MSPs, together in cross-party conviviality.On election nights we stayed up late, with leading SNP officials rubbing along with Scottish Conservatives, all under the same roof. Nationalist guests mingled with Unionists at our children’s christening parties. This all seems unimaginable today.Having married a Scot and raised two children north of the border, I believed I had found the perfect spot to lay down roots forever, with Scotland’s uncrowded city spaces and its glorious countryside, more affordable (compared to London) standard of living and, in particular, its friendly people. My sense of belonging was secure.Even during the referendum, nearly eight years ago, when the constitutional battle split the country in two, and neighbour turned on neighbour, I didn’t budge. My adopted home still had much to offer, I thought, though little old ladies were too scared to put up ‘Better Together’ posters in their windows, and my daughter, canvassing for the Unionists, was chased down the road by a Nationalist nutter.The separatists might have been defeated in 2014 but their mounting supremacy ever since has transformed Scotland into a one-party state. In power too long, Nationalist group-think has permeated the culture and, for many non-Scots, made the place feel like a foreign country.I always maintained that being English in Scotland was not the problem, but being anti-Nationalist was. Now, despite the likes of Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader in the Commons, saying Nationalists should be nice to the English, I can see that for hard-line secessionists this is a big ask. There is a fine line between bashing Westminster - the SNP leadership’s stock in trade - and denigrating the entire country. There are Nationalists who don’t even recognise the difference and whose desire to break up Britain seems based solely on their dislike of the English.Even in the higher reaches of the party hierarchy, Anglophobic sentiments colour all judgement. Former presiding officer Tricia Marwick described students at St Andrews as ‘anti-Scottish’ this week after an undergraduate penned a mocking piece about Sturgeon in the student newspaper.Why a so-called Nationalist grandee saw it necessary to interfere in campus mischief is mystifying, but Marwick’s inability to distinguish between ‘anti-Nationalist’ and ‘anti-Scottish’ betrays the Anglophobia at the heart of the SNP.Older, wiser Nats, such as Jim Sillars, former deputy leader of the SNP, despair at this seeping poison and blame it on those at the top.I don’t think we should exaggerate the undertone of anti-Englishness that exists in Scotland, he said last year, but it is there, and the grudge and grievance tactic of the SNP leadership does play to it and keeps it alive.It is only now that I am 400 miles removed, and not tuned into the daily nuances of Scottish political discourse, that I realise how deeply ingrained the Nationalist rhetoric has become, how monotonous, and, yes, how alienating to those of us who see our future differently.The prospect of independence might still be remote but the two sides of the ide remain entrenched, with the (roughly) half of Scotland that wants to break up Britain co-existing uneasily with the other half.The view from London is liberating. I have swapped Edinburgh’s grandeur for a Thameside suburb. From my study window, instead of the splendid Botanic Gardens, I can see right inside the top deck of the number 281 to Tolworth. Property is expensive, council tax eye-watering and the roads are choked. But the cultural and political landscape is pluralistic, and the atmosphere, from my English perspective, nowhere near as toxic. Even after a quarter of a century away, it feels like home. More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Up to 100 feared dead after Russia strikes Ukrainian barracks Cricket in the cold is the most likely time for a leg breakRussia uses \u0026#39invincible\u0026#39 hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for the first timeMurder investigation launched after woman, 19, found dead in LondonBritish volunteer fighters may have triggered deadly strike on Ukrainian base after their phones were detectedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive nazanin zaghari ratcliffe spends first days reunited","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family spent their first days together in Britain staying at a government-owned grace-and-favour mansion in the Buckinghamshire countryside, The  can reveal.The British-Iranian national, who was imprisoned in Tehran for nearly six years until her release this week, was driven from RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning to Dorneywood, a country home historically used by Chancellors of the Exchequer.She stayed there until Saturday morning with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, and was pictured on Friday making pizzas with them in the house’s large professional kitchen.Dorneywood is an 18th-century Georgian property donated to the National Trust in 1947 by Lord Courtauld-Thomson, a British businessman who had previously used it to house officers from the allied air forces.It sits in 215 acres of parkland and woodland, and boasts a swimming pool, conservatory and croquet lawn famously used by the house’s former occupant, John Prescott.Generally, the house has been used by Chancellors of the Exchequer, but the Prime Minister can choose to allow any member of the Government to use it. In recent years it has been used by Philip Hammond, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak.Like Chequers, the Prime Minister’s grace-and-favour home, and Chevening, which is usually used by the Foreign Secretary, the house is managed by a trust overseen by peers, aristocrats and heritage experts.Government departments can request use of the house from the trust, which was this week snapped up by the Foreign Office, who designated it as a “safe house” for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family.The family were sworn to secrecy on the location of the property in an attempt to allow them to reunite in peace, outside of the glare of the media.Broadcasters positioned a camera outside their London house for two days after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return to the UK in the hope of picturing their return home.On Friday Mr Ratcliffe tweeted that his wife and daughter were making pizzas in the kitchen, accompanied by a photograph at Dorneywood that was quickly copied by Tulip Siddiq, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for his wife’s release.The  understands he was later contacted by Foreign Office officials who asked him to delete it because they were concerned it would allow their location to be identified.Mr Ratcliffe has been prolific in the British media since his wife’s imprisonment in Iran in April 2016, after she was accused of training journalists in the country - a claim he has always denied.He has completed two hunger strikes since her internment in an attempt to persuade ministers to do more to secure her release.The Iranian regime finally agreed to allow her to leave the country this week, after Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, negotiated a deal involving the UK repaying a decades-old debt of £400million.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was accompanied by Anoosheh Ashoori, 66, a fellow British-Iranian national imprisoned by the regime in 2017.As Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe disembarked from her jet at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning, seven-year-old Gabriella was heard to exclaim: “Mummy!” Mr Ratcliffe told reporters that the trio were “looking forward to a new life”.You can\u0027t get back the time that\u0027s gone,” he said.“That\u0027s a fact. But we live in the future.Ms Truss tweeted on their return to the UK: “Delighted that Nazanin and Anoosheh have landed safely in the UK and are reunited with their families and loved ones.

The prime minister is told by his spin doctor to distance himself from James Whitehouse “because the behaviour of entitled toffs is something the public no longer finds cute”.The six-part drama is based on the novel of the same name by Sarah Vaughan, a former political correspondent for .The drama was launched at a Netflix event this week where SJ Clarkson, the director, was cautious about discussing the inspiration for her on-screen depiction of “debauched boys with champagne and money”.“Is it based on anything? It’s based on a book,” she said.However, Miller was more direct: “It deals with privilege in a way that we are seeing unravel daily in our government. It really is very close to the bone.“It’s art imitating life. It’s exciting. We do live in a country that’s not really a meritocracy a lot of the time where if you had access to education of a certain standard and calibre, and go through the motions, you have aspirations of being in government.Miller said that the drama is also the study of a marriage, and of how a woman reacts to news that the man she thought she knew has been unfaithful.The media spotlight is turned on Sophie Whitehouse\u0027s character and Miller said she knew how that felt. In 2005, Jude Law, Miller’s fiance at the time, was caught cheating on her with his children’s nanny and made a public apology.“What would a rational person’s response be to some terrible behaviour? It felt meta and weird and uncomfortable.”The original novel was published in 2018 and became an instant bestseller. Vaughan has said that it was inspired in part by Boris Johnson’s affair with Petronella Wyatt, which led to him being sacked from the Conservative frontbench in 2004.“To me, Anatomy is really about entitlement and the scandal of entitlement,” Vaughan recently told .She said that Mr Johnson is “not in any way James”, adding: “I obviously don’t think he’s guilty of any sort of sexual offence. It was his approach to the truth that interested me.”Anatomy of a Scandal will launch on Netflix on April 15. Miller said that the rape allegation is portrayed with nuance: “James is the product of a system and he doesn’t believe he’s done anything wrong. He’s always been told ‘yes’, he’s always been privileged, he’s always been entitled.“When does he know if ‘no means no’ if he’s never been taught this?”Miller said that the fictional rape case was “really polarising” and she hoped it would provoke “wild arguments across dinner tables… it’s complicated and people feel differently about it and that is how you start to inspire interesting conversations about change”.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Up to 100 feared dead after Russia strikes Ukrainian barracks Cricket in the cold is the most likely time for a leg breakRussia uses \u0026#39invincible\u0026#39 hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for the first timeMurder investigation launched after woman, 19, found dead in LondonBritish volunteer fighters may have triggered deadly strike on Ukrainian base after their phones were detectedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"po ferries sackings not cost brexit","story":"Brexitdisaster was the Twitter hashtag that greeted news of the mass redundancies at P\u0026ampO Ferries this week.The leading operator of ships between Dover and Calais brutally made 800 workers redundant over a video-call on Thursday after organising for cheap agency staff to replace the sacked employees when the three-minute pre-recorded message went out.Naturally, Remainiacs could not resist blaming the crisis on our exit from the EU, for no obvious reason whatsoever.They ignored entirely the pandemic-sized hole that Covid has left in P\u0026ampO Ferries’ finances. The business made a £100 million loss year on year because of coronavirus travel restrictions. (I can’t imagine French President Emmanuel Macron’s ludicrous omicron ban on the English travelling to France before Christmas will have helped much either).Pro-EU fanatics also disregarded the fact that P\u0026ampO Ferries is ultimately owned by Dubai-based giant DP World, which only last week announced “record results”, with sales up 25 per cent to $10.8 billion.Run by Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, DP World is reportedly spending more than £100 million to be title sponsor for the 2022 European Golf Tour.A foreign-based company seeking to replace British workers with cheaper labour is not a consequence of us leaving the EU. In fact, it’s the sort of behaviour that caused millions of people to vote for Brexit in the first place.More than that, one of the ways the Government might now be able to penalise DP World actually comes thanks to the referendum result – since it can take away lucrative contracts to operate two of the UK’s planned freeport schemes.But you won’t hear many Remainers admitting to that.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Up to 100 feared dead after Russia strikes Ukrainian barracks Cricket in the cold is the most likely time for a leg breakRussia uses \u0026#39invincible\u0026#39 hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for the first timeMurder investigation launched after woman, 19, found dead in LondonBritish volunteer fighters may have triggered deadly strike on Ukrainian base after their phones were detectedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west putting mercy hostile nuclear powers","story":"If you happened to catch the moment when Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya described the bombing of civilian targets in Ukraine as fiction invented by a western disinformation campaign, you may have been tempted to laugh. Not because the actual events we witness on our television screens every day are remotely funny, but because the audacity of this man’s insistence was so ridiculous as to constitute a kind of comic relief.There has been much speculation about whether Putin himself is technically mad or just the latest in a historic line of murderous dictators whose actions are rational in their own terms. But it is equally important to determine whether his agents at home and abroad are party to what must be either psychosis or pure evil. Are they, in other words, enthusiastically complicit with whatever this is – or just trapped in what has become too big a lie to unwind?The West needs to make a working decision on this as a matter of urgency because it is the key to how the war must be handled. So far the political leadership on our side has decided that for the moment at least, it is impossible to know the definitive answer. That is why the West’s strategy for reacting to the crisis, for all its celebrated unity and vigorous resolve, lacks any sense of a clear ultimate objective.What exactly are we aiming for here apart from an immediate end to the criminal invasion of a sovereign country? If the leaders of the western nations, who are so enthusiastically unanimous in their support for Ukraine, do not know what they are dealing with (lunatics or cold-blooded murderers?), how are they supposed to calibrate the effectiveness of their own moves?While it might be hard to deny the sense and obvious conscientiousness of this observation, what was the point of stating it so unequivocally at precisely this point? Was the US president (who apparently said this spontaneously and without consultation, to a television interviewer) running on the assumption that Putin is so mentally unstable that he might press the nuclear button at any opportunity? Or was he betting that Putin is perfectly rational and would therefore be shamed in the eyes of the world by this display of moral responsibility from the West?The philosophy of nuclear weapons as a deterrent always rested on the principle that they could be used. If this threat is voluntarily surrendered at the outset of any conflict then their deterrence value evaporates. But more importantly, the existence of them in the hands of another country prevents (according to the Biden doctrine) even a conventional military response to its actions, however vile they are.In other words, we are declaring ourselves helpless in the face of any onslaught from any nuclear power, and the fact that we also possess such weapons counts for nothing. We might as well go for unilateral nuclear disarmament and admit that we are at the mercy of any country that has such weapons: however immoral its actions are, we will never act against it. Lesson to the nations of the world: get and keep your own nuclear arsenal and you will become invulnerable.Not in the short term, they won’t. Putin himself (and his personal wealth) will be untouched for the foreseeable future – and to a man who has anointed himself  of the national soul, it is his own survival that matters. As for the rest of the damage, Russia has lived through such catastrophic times before.When the Soviet Union was a global pariah, its people endured material hardships and a degree of cultural isolation that had become unthinkable in western Europe. It had a fictitious economy built on a valueless currency and a closed society that perpetuated an absurd myth of national triumph. Not so different from today. You think Putin can’t get away with this for long? Stalin got away with it for 30 years. Of course, fashions change in the style of tyrannical rule.

The Insolvency Service has been tasked with probing whether the firm complied with strict notication requirements. No said ministers do not believe PO explored all possible avenues to secure the future of their firm before making staff redundant. RMT union general secretary Mick Lynch claimed PO Ferries had “flagrantly broken the law, deliberately”.  Asked by the Mirrorit broke the law, PO today insisted it followed “standard industry practice” by offering “enhanced severance terms” to those affected and “properly compensating them for the lack of warning and consultation.”.So what can the government actually do  How much did Boris Johnson know  And are his own failings on workers’ rights to blame - including failing to ban fire and rehire There are an awful lot of questions the Prime Minister needs to answer…Who owns PO Ferries This is not a question for Boris Johnson but is important to give context. The brand was bought in February  by DP World, a global shipping giant primarily owned by the Government in Dubai, UAE. It was founded  years ago and runs ports around the globe, handling around one in  of all the world’s shipping containers. Last year the companyaposs revenue soared by more than a fth to more than £.bn and pre-tax profit rose by nearly m.The Mirror revealed in January how the giant firm splashed up to £m sponsoring a golf contest despite a £m pension black hole. The company declined to comment but did not dispute the figures. Have PO ferries acted illegally TV’s Judge Rinder claimed yesterday “it’s legal” - but employment lawyers and the government have serious doubts. Downing Street confirmed it is looking into whether PO followed laws on having to consult with workers and noty the authorities. Firms must by law noty the Insolvency Service - and consult with staff -they plan to make more than  staff redundant at one site. If there are  to  redundancies at a site, this must be at least  days before the first dismissal. If there are  or more, it’s  days. A union source told the Mirror union officials are % sure the action was unlawful, in their opinion, and are looking into the situation. Chris Deeley of JMW Solicitors said PO’s actions “seem to be flagrant breaches of employment law” which would trigger “incredibly expensive” enhanced severance packages.  Employment lawyer Colin Davidson of Edwards Duthie Shamash said: “PO could be facing a potential bill of millions in compensation for the shocking and callous sacking of  employees with no notice. “There are two separate claims that they could be hit with – a payment for failing to consult and one for unfair dismissal,it is found that the sackings are unfair. Employment lawyer Peter Woodhouse of Stone King, said: “It’s dficult to see how the dismissal of the workers was lawful”. He said there were four key questions - whether the firm consulted in advance whether there was unfair dismissal whether employees were given notice and whether a discrimination claim can be brought. Katie Maguire, employment partner at Devonshires, said: “The way PO have flown in the face of employment law beggars’ belief and their potentially unlawful actions will cost them dearly. PO’s response is at the bottom of this article.If PO acted illegally, what will the punishment be TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the firm “must be made an example of” and “a slap on the wrist is not going to cut it”. The TUC want the government to “increase penalties on companies that break employment law”. It also wants the government to use its leverage with Freeports and contractsto go above and beyond any legally-required punishment. Union officials fear any punishment or civil action against the firm will not be strong enough to stop others doing the same thing. One told the Mirror: “They don’t give a s*** about the fact it’s unlawful.” Was your Brexit workers’ rights promise hollow  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps fumed today: “No-one should treat employees in that way in the st century.But critics say Boris Johnson could have acted to toughen up the law already. Not only that - he promised to.The PM pledged an Employment Bill after Brexit would “protect and enhance workers’ rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work.”Yet we are still waiting for that Bill with no guarantees it will even be listed in the next Queen’s Speech. The Tories also passed the  Trade Union Act which diluted workers’ power and made it more dficult to go on strike. Read more Commentator Otto English tweeted: “One of the key selling points of Brexit was that ‘no longer’ would cheap foreign labour undercut British workers. The PO debacle totally undermines that lie doesnapost it.” Downing Street today insisted one “extreme example” does not indicate “the direction of travel for the entirety of the UK”. But employment law expert Dr Ioannis Katsaroumpas of the University of Sussex said the scandal highlighted the “weak legal framework for preventing it happening again.” The TUC demanded tougher laws to stop staff being fired at will.Will you stop the actual sackings The TUC say all sacked staff must be reinstated immediately without loss of pay, and PO should face serious consequencesnot. But can the government actually do anything to ensure this  Andnot, will Boris Johnson get round the table with them  Defence Minister James Heappey said the company had behaved disgracefully but claimed the Government was powerless to stop it. He told Sky News: “Sadly it is the case that the government cannot force an employer to continue to employ people that the employer has said it doesn’t want to employ.” When did you find out Senior Department of Transport officials were informed on Wednesday night of PO’s plan to axe workers. But it is thought they did not tell ministers - and the Prime Minister, who was travelling in the Gulf, was not told either. The PM’s official spokesman said: “As is standard practice, the information was on a restricted circulation due to its commercial sensitivity and the potential for insolvencythis leaked”. He added: “I don’t know exactly when the Prime Minister was informed”. This raises the extraordinary prospect that civil servants had to withhold a scandalous treatment of workers from ministers who could have tried to do something to stop it.Was it raised on your trip to the Gulf Boris Johnson visited the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, hours before the grim news was conveyed to officials. PO Ferries owner DP World is majority-owned by the Dubai Sovereign Wealth Fund and, therefore, ultimately by the Dubai Royal Family. Labour today demanded the Prime Minister answer whether “anyone” raised the issue on his trip.The PMaposs spokesman denied PO was raised in his meeting with the Crown Prince of the UAE on Wednesday. He suggested the issue did not come up at all, in any way during the trip, though could not completely rule it out. But he ruled out lobbying Dubai directly to solve the issue. The PM’s spokesman said: “I think we will deal directly with this company to find out what has happened. It’s not a question of needing to convince any inidual or group. We’ll find out the facts and see whether they complied with the law.”Will DP World’s Freeport licence be revoked DP World owns the Thames Freeport in Tilbury, Essex, part of a wave of low-tax initiatives pioneered by the Tory government. No did not rule out stripping the container port’s special status away, but any decision to do so would fly in the face of Tory dogma. The PM’s spokesman said: We are looking very closely at the actions that this company has taken to see whether they acted within the rules. Once we have concluded that, we will decide what the ramications are. “Obviously there are a lot of valid questions in relation to existing contracts, etc. We are working through exactly the detail of what action the company took. “Once we have come to that conclusion, we will set out any further steps.Does PO have any current government contracts and will you dump them Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: Iaposll be looking at whether there are contracts the Government might have with PO. “I’ve asked my officials, legal teams, to look at whether they exist. Records show PO Ferries previously held government contracts to keep supplies runningports were hamstrung due to Brexit. These included a deal worth up to £.m to provide freight capacity between Tilbury and Zebrugge from October  to June . But that contract has already ended. It was not immediately clearany current PO Ferries contracts with the government were in force. No conspicuously didn’t rule out terminating PO contracts with government - butnone exist, then this is an empty threat. Will you nationalise ferry routes The TSSA union called for the government to hit PO Ferries “where it hurts” by nationalising ferry routes such as across the Channel. Manuel Cortes, TSSA general Secretary, said: “PO are holding our country to ransom by halting vital ferry trade routes so they can illegally and immorally sack their staff. The Tory government must stand up to PO bullies who are controlled by Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem the owner of the company. “The government should nationalise these vital ferry routes which allow people and goods to get to and from our country - PO must be hit where it hurts!” But Tory chairman Oliver Dowden said he was not aware of any plans to nationalise routes. Why didn’t you ban fire  rehire  The scandal erupted just five months after Tory MPs killed off a bid to outlaw ‘ fire and rehire’.Dover MP Natalie Elphicke was heckled by union members today who chanted “shame on you!” Labour MP Barry Gardiner had tried to ban the practice of firms sacking staff, then hiring them back on worse terms and conditions. But Tory ministers blocked attempts to force a vote on his Bill, talking beyond a .pm cut-off time under arcane Commons rules. Mr Gardiner said last night: “The disgraceful actions taken by PO against their  seafarers shows yet again how employers are abusing the laws around fire and rehire.”  A Whitehall source hit back that PO Ferries’ actions did not appear to be a case of fire and rehire. They said instead the firm appeared to be firing staff to hire dferent people on less money. But No contradicted this, saying whether or not this counts as ‘fire and rehire’ is one thing the government is looking at. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: There are rules around fire and rehire. There are rules around notying relevant government departments when you are making redundancies, and obviously there are the contracts that we have with the company. We are looking at all of those issues before deciding what steps . We will find out the facts and seethey have complied with the law.Will you claw back furlough cash The £ million purchase of PO Ferries was unfortunately timed for DP World. The company was forced to claim around £ million to furlough , workers during the pandemic. No appeared to dampen hopes that the firm could be asked, or forced, to give back furlough cash. The PM’s spokesman said: “Businesses in receipt of support for the furlough scheme would have been using that money to carry on employing their employees during the pandemic. “That was a leline for people during that global pandemic. And it is right that we took that step.” What do PO say A spokesperson for PO Ferries said: We know that for our staff this redundancy came without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families. “We took this dficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn’t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies. “We also took the view, in good faith, that reaching agreement on the way forward would be impossible and against this background, that the process itself would be highly disruptive, not just for the business but for UK trade and tourism. “We have offered enhanced severance terms to those affected to properly and promptly compensate them for the lack of warning and consultation. The changes weaposve made bring us into line with standard industry practice. The firm added: “All affected crew who worked yesterday were notied face-to-face and in-person, on board their vessels. “For crew who were rostered off, PO Ferries made all efforts to noty them personally: Virtual meetings were held, they were also inidually telephoned, plus email and SMS notications were sent before dismissal letters and severance terms were shared via courier and email. “For any crew members we did not reach personally despite this cascade of steps, regretfully the news of their dismissal must have come as a shock and we apologise for this.

While most OECD countries have delivered signicant pay growth to their workers since the financial crisis, real wages in the UK have fallen. The Trades Union Congress has revealed we lag behind  OECD countries. Average annual pay growth in the UK has been -.% since , and it is among just seven out of  OECD countries where real pay growth since  is negative. The highest rates of annual real pay growth since  have been in the Baltic states, Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia , followed by Polandand Slovakia , said the TUC.  If the UK had kept pace with the OECD average since , the typical UK worker’s pay packet would be worth £, more today. General secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Over the last decade, workers in most of the world got a pay rise, but in the UK wages are now worth less than they were before the financial crisis. “Over the last  years, Conservative ministers chose to impose austerity, cut public sector pay, and attack workers’ rights to bargain for fair pay through their trade unions. “Now these years of weak pay growth have left millions of working families badly exposed to soaring bills and prices. Everything’s going up – but wages. “Britain needs a pay rise. The Chancellor must put higher wages at the heart of his Spring Statement, and ministers must get unions and employers around the table to negotiate binding fair pay agreements in every sector of the economy to get wages rising.”Full list of  countries with higher real pay than the UK Lithuania .

The Americans agreed earlier this year to open talks aimed at abolishing the duties. But experts believe President Joe Biden may be resisting cutting tarfs because of the ongoing deadlock over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Cabinet Minister Ms Trevelyan is due to hold trade talks with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai in Baltimore next week. In his letter, Mr Thomas-Symonds tells her: “I urge you to raise this issue and ask that negotiations can be expedited so that a satisfactory resolution can be found as soon as feasibly possible.”Speaking to the Mirror, he added: “ Two months have passed since Anne-Marie Trevelyan confirmed the opening of negotiations to lt the punishing steel and aluminium tarfs imposed by President Trump in  and, as of yet, no solution has been found to get these tarfs lted.“With the same tarfs having been eased for the EU on New Year’s Day and, shortly, to be eased for Japan, too, the pressure on our UK steel industry is increasing.“Steel is a foundational industry for our country, vital for its security and prosperity. “Time is running out. Effective action on this issue from the Secretary of State for International Trade is long overdue.” A Department for International Trade spokesman said: “The International Trade Secretary continues to speak toSecretaryRaimondo regularly to maintain momentum behind constructive discussions to resolve Section  tarfs. “Until a deal is reached that works for the UK and is in the interests of our steel and aluminium industry, we will continue to apply rebalancing measures on US products.” Sources said it took Japan and the US three months to agree to end tarfs, and the US and EU five months.

The Chancellor unveils his Spring Statement mini-Budget on Wednesday and is under pressure to unlock cash so steel companies can invest in more environmentally-friendly technologies. A coalition of unions and think-tanks is calling on the Cabinet Minister to intervene so the sector can thrive while helping fight climate change. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter It has issued three demands, seen exclusively by the Mirror, including: allocating £million pledged through the Government’s Clean Steel Fund, first announced two years ago using next week’s Spring Statement to “level out the playing field and tackle the structural lack of competitiveness of UK steel industry” and using former EU research and development funds for coal and steel to “support innovation in viable green steel technologies, such as hydrogen”.  Community steelworkersapos union operations director Alasdair McDiarmid said: “Britain cannot deliver net-zero without a strong steel industry at the core of our green supply chains. “Supporting a green steel transition is a test of the Government’s commitment to British industry and industrial communities. “The forthcoming budget presents a golden opportunity for the Chancellor to back our steelworkers and put levelling-up into practice.”  Miriam Brett, of the Common Wealth think-tank, said: “The future of steel is green, and securing a long term future for green steel means protecting steel jobs now. “The industry currently sits at a critical juncture, and safeguarding its future should be a priority. “The UK Budget provides a key opportunity to implement a strategy for urgent and signicant investment to create a world-leading green steel sector, helping the Government to deliver on its promise of levelling-up, while securing good, green, unionised jobs and boosting innovation and exports.” UK steelmakers belched out about  million tonnes of carbon dioxide - including indirect emissions from power production - in . Producers accounted for .% of UK industrial emissions and .% of all Britain’s greenhouse gases.  Industry figures say pumping cash into greener technologies to boost production will help manufacturers fight global warming - rather than fuelling climate change. The Commons Environmental Audit Committee is carrying out an inquiry into how to make the £.billion industry, which directly employs , workers, with another , in supply chains, more environmentally-friendly. TUC Cymru general secretary Shavannah Taj said: “The global disruption resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows exactly why the UK needs a domestic steel industry. “In the wider context of a climate emergency, this must transition into a zero-carbon, clean steel industry which will secure thousands of quality jobs, a stronger economy and a safer climate future for our children.  “To get there, we need Sunak to step up and invest into decarbonising our future”. GMB national officer Charlotte Childs said: aposaposNet-zero deadlines are creeping closer and the Government is not helping the steel industry make a fair, just transition. “This plan sets in motion what the Government should have started years ago - protecting jobs, the environment and investing in the future of UK steel.aposapos Jonathan Webb, of the IPPR North think tank, said: “The steel industry is a vital part of the Northaposs past and present.  “However, it will only be a part of the futurewe support the industry to transition to new forms of zero carbon steel making. “Now is the time to invest in a green steel transition to ensure the Northaposs steel industry has a bright future.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON European UnionSpring StatementJonathan WebbClimate changePoliticsSave Our Steel campaign\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He should tell that to the workers at PO Ferries. They will want to know what is moral about bosses sacking hundreds of staff by Zoom with immediate notice, or about the UKaposs feeble employment laws, which allow their jobs to be replaced by cheaper labour. And what is moral about their Dubai-based parent company, DP World, making people redundant despite reaping the benefits of the UK furlough scheme.This is a firm that has spent more than £million sponsoring the European Golf Tour and Renaultaposs F team but claims it canapost afford to offer decent pay and conditions. Its treatment of staff is disgraceful but they operate this way because this Government has given the green light to the worst aspects of capitalism. Tory MPs who yesterday protested against the casual sacking of workers belong to a party that has spent years making it easier for firms to do so.The Government that yesterday complained about the use of fire and rehire is the same one that blocked legislation which would have prevented it. POaposs move is not a one-off example of cut-throat corporate behaviour, it is a harbinger of what is to come as the Conservatives further erode long-standing workersapos rights.

Chaos has hit ports including Hull and Dover after workers who found out they had been sacked on Thursday via a recorded video have begun protests. And passengers left suddenly without transport have been trying to find out information. PO initially said that some services were being cancelled for “several days” but that then reportedly was extended to  days.The supply chain in the UK, already hit by Brexit and Covid, now faces more mayhem with claims that fresh food will not be arriving at shops due to the cancelled ferries. Experts have said that anything from Spanish cheese and wine to French croissants could be affected while farmers have said that livestock including thousands of sheep may have to be slaughtered. Edward Adamson, a sheep farmer from County Antrim in Northern Ireland, said he may have to kill some sheepthe ferry crisis continues.There is no route to the UK mainland for us otherwise. We produce more animals than we need you see and we canapost just keep them, he said, reported The Sun.We just hope it doesnapost last long and will just have to hold on. We can last about three months but then we will have to trade within Northern Ireland and the rest will be slaughtered. [The ferry] is a leline between Northern Ireland and the mainland. When it comes to food itaposs much more important.Director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium Andrew Opie told the Daily Mail : Retailers are working with other ferry companies to ensure disruption to PO ferry services do not interfere with the movement of fresh food between GB, NI and EU. Nonetheless, a prolonged interruption to PO services, who are an important part of UK supply chains, could eventually impact the flow of goods. We urge the ferry company and union to find a speedy resolution to the current issues. Protesters in London have called on the Government to nationalise PO Ferries after the company sacked  people without notice. The staff were fired on Thursday and attempts are being made to replace them with agency workers. Demonstrations have been held at ports in Liverpool, Larne, Hull and Dover, as unions call for a boycott of the company.  At least  protesters also gathered outside the officers of PO Ferriesapos owner DP World in Victoria, central London on Friday. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union , Unite, Transport Salaried Staffsapos Associationand Nautilus International joined the demonstration. Protesters chanted: Nationalise PO, Seize the ships, and donapost go PO and Solidarity forever. They also held up signs saying: Save Our Seafarers and Stop the PO jobs carve up. After speaking to the crowd, Steve Hedley, RMT senior associate general secretary, said: It was one of the most brutal and appalling sackings Iaposve witnessed in over  years as a trade unionist. We are absolutely furious.  I meanthis can happen in Dover, this can happen anywhere. If this can happen with PO, every rotten boss and capitalist in the country are going to be queuing up to do the same thing - sack all their staff and bring in staff on half their wages. Mr Hedley said workers were in tears on Thursday as people who had worked there for  years were getting thrown off a ship at two hours notice. These are workers who worked all the way through the pandemic, who were told they were essential workers, heroes, all the rest of it, when it comes down to it, discarded like trash, he added. PO Ferries said in a statement: We took this dficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldnapost survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies.

David Lynch says he will always put the teenager first as the cost of living crisis deepens across Britain.The -year-old, from Coventry, west Midlands, has spoken after it was revealed the debt level in the city has now tripled.He talked to the BBC in an attempt to highlight the issue and says he can go days at a time without eating properly, CoventryLive reports.Mr Lynch has been unemployed since being laid-off as a warehouse packer. He said his daughter, who stays with him on alternate weekends, is “the centre of his world”. But the -year-old single dad, who has been forced to go to a food bank, said he struggled to afford the bills at his rented flat in the city.He said: “I have gone three or four days without food.“She thinks I am a hero because I try and make what I have got special. Sometimes I wonder whether to put electric on or gas on or do I pay for food ” He called on government ministers to try living with people like him, working out how to pay bills “rather than just sit there in a suit and tie and pretend they know what it is like to live off benefits”.  The report also spoke to the boss of Coventry Citizens Advice, who painted an alarming picture of debt levels and the number of people struggling in the city. Chief executive Kate Algate said the charity was supporting hundreds of families in the city and had seen an increase in demand for its help. She added that given its finite resources, Citizens Advice could only see about a quarter of those seeking advice. She said: “What we have seen in the last  months is that the amount of debt people have come to us with has tripled over [the period]. A government spokesman told the BBC its £ billion support package for energy costs included a £ council tax rebate in April for most households and a £ energy bill discount in October - which would have to be repaid over five years.

The month ordinarily brings daily highs of around °C with the temperatures dropping to °C in the evening. But some ambitious forecasters believe this year we could see sweltering highs of °C.The Liverpool Echo reports comments from meteorology expert Jim Dale who predicted the UK could see the arrival of hot weather fairly early this year.The mercury is predicted to reach its highest point in the middle of April.And forecasters at the Met Office say  will be among the warmest years on record. But experts have, strangely, also also said it will be cooler than some more recent years. This is because of the impact of La Niña in the tropical Pacic where sea surface temperatures are below average, which will have a bearing on warmer temperatures.Dr Nick Dunstone, Met Office scientist, told WalesOnline : “Global temperature has been slightly suppressed during  because of the cooling influence of La Niña in the tropical Pacic.With another La Niña now underway, making this a so-called ‘double-dip’ La Niña, it is not surprising that we are forecasting another relatively cool year for global temperatures when compared with the run of years since . But he also said it was still likely it would continue the series of warmest years for global temperature since . While this is good news for fans of warmer climes, the Met Office is currently predicting April weather to be mild or very mild with spells of colder conditions also possible.  As expected the sunniest weather is more likely to surface in the south and the east of the country. While some forecasters predicted C, despite the present balmy conditions, not all meteorologists are convinced this will happen until next month, BirminghamLive reports that up to April , the Met Office predicts: Conditions are likely to become more changeable during this period with spells of drier weather interspersed with showers or longer periods of rainfall. This rainfall will probably be highest in the west and northwestern areas with drier weather on average in the southeast. It added: Periods of strong winds are also likely, especially across the north. Temperatures most likely close to or slightly above average. The scales do start to tip into warmer weather come Easter with between C and C forecast for the middle of April.  Weather forecaster Jim Dale also told the Express: I know March is the start of spring but I think weaposre probably going to get properly into April before we start to see the searing sort of temperatures. I wouldnapost be surprised to see C, C, C in the middle of April. This week, however, the UK is expected to be warmer than Barcelona and Rome at times. Sunny, balmy conditions can be expected across the UK today with a Met Office meteorologist saying temperatures are slightly above average for the time of year. Met Office meteorologist Richard Miles said: We’re expecting a few fine days towards the end of the week, with temperatures around C and C over most of the UK.

Things got so bad she had to take sleeping tablets given to her by her doctorTracy Snodgrass and her family have had to endure the infestation Image: Daily Record WSByRuth SuterGraeme Murray:,  Mar |commentsA family have been terrorised by rats for almost eight months. Mum Tracy Snodgrass, and her son and daughter have suffered a vermin infestation after they first appeared in August last year. The -year-old was horried by the mice and rats her Glasgow home and feared they would appear in her bed at night. It caused her to be prescribed sleeping pills by her doctor as she could not fall asleep. Images have emerged of her home covered in rodent droppings which also saw the rodents leave mess on her mattresses and inside shoes.

She was forced to move her family into her parents home despite paying more than £ in rent and council tax for the flat.Tracy, who is mum to Pamela, , and Mason, , told the Daily Record : The situation has been so traumatising to a point that when I killed a rat in my house seven months ago, I havenapost been back since.It was in my daughteraposs bedroom and in my bedroom before I caught it with a sticky mat.

We found droppings on the mattresses all the time, so they were obviously crawling all over the beds when we werenapost there.

Despite laying down traps and poison, as well as filling holes in the walls and floors, Tracey says the problem still remains and thinks the infestation is now in the walls and under the floorboards. She added: It makes no dference. The traps never once caught any rats - theyaposre actually still lying in my house from three months ago.

But whatthat was all you could do because there was no gas, electricity, heating or – shock horror – access to any kind of technology. Would you be able to deal with all of that for six months  Even those who yearn to live a simpler le and escape the stress of the modern world might find it a bit of a stretch. Add in the fact you would have no car and would be running a working farm with ancient equipment and it’s enough to put anyone off.But, tempted by the idea of the experiment for new Channel  show The Simpler Le, people volunteered in their droves. One of them, -year-old mobile phone addict Kevin, said: “I liked the fact we would be living a more simple le and we would put our technology down.” The unemployed waiter, who suffers from colitis, saw the programme as a chance to change.Kevin, who was diagnosed with the condition when he was , explained: “I wanted to adopt a healthier lestyle and this was a chance to do that. “I did rely on my phone. I played video games and I watched too much Netflix… I liked the idea of being closer to nature.” Kevin, from Wigan, Gtr Manchester, was one of  strangers who signed up to live with an Amish family on a -acre farmstead in Devon – and abide by their rules. The traditionalist Christian family, from the American state of Ohio, eschew the trappings of modern le and place importance on self-sufficiency and community instead. And as part of the TV show looking at whether modern le is bad for us, the participants had to be fully self-sustainable and work with others on the farm, as well as help build a barn. They were also given traditional Amish clothes to wear – plain long frocks for the women and simple straight-cut suits for the men, without collars, lapels or pockets. The tasks on the farm were also vied up. Kevin, for example, was put on watering duty, weeding and building the barn. On a typical day, the group would be woken by a loud bell at .am then have porridge with water for breakfast. After, they would head out to the farm with some of the women staying behind to prepare lunch – usually eggs, homemade breador potatoes with some vegetables – and dinner, which consisted of fish caught on the farm lake, with more veg. Kevin thrived on the self-sufficient lestyle. He said: “By the end, I was leading the farm operation and we were selling our vegetables. We learned how to be enterprising, and it was so exciting going to town on a horse and cart.” He told how the evenings were “special” too, without TV or radio. “Once you take away the distractions, there is nothing to do but talk,” Kevin said. “Also, the farm work was so tiring that by pm, you were ready for shut-eye. I read a lot by candle and would normally go to bed around pm.” Kevin made it to the end of the experiment and found it to be a positive experience. But not everyone felt the same. Londoner Penny, who loved the designer lestyle, only lasted a month. The -year-old decided to go on the programme after she was taken to hospital with a terrible bout of Covid alongside her daughter, Dilara, . The former PA to Premier League footballers said: “The idea of escaping from reality seemed liked a good idea.” But Penny admitted that as soon as she arrived with Dilara and her youngest daughter, Azara, nine, she knew she had made a mistake. “To have no phone, TV, electricity, heating or lighting was awful. I struggled so much and it felt so alien.“I was the only one in the main house with children and I would often go to my bedroom and cry.” Four weeks into the experiment, Penny decided to quit. “I missed my fashion, clothes, my family and friends and I was lonely,” she said. But it wasn’t all bad. Penny admitted: “I’ve gone from a size  to a size - and I feel much better.”The Simpler Le starts on Channel  on Tuesday at .pm.

Kate looks like a natural as she carries out her royal duties with confidence and a huge smile on her face, but her position hasnapost always been so comfortable. In her early days as a royal, the Duchess was understandably a lot more reserved and cautious - never veering too far away from husband Prince William. However, according to a body language expert, Kateaposs shyness bears striking resemblance to another member of the royal family when she was in the spotlight - her late mother-in-law Princess Diana.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Darren Stanton told Marie Claire magazine: Kate was arguably more reserved when she was first thrown into the spotlight several years ago.She behaved in a similar way Princess Diana did when she first got engaged to Prince Charles. Kate would always stay very close to William and continuously look towards him to seek his approval and reassurance. Stanton said itaposs very clear Kate is now less reliant on William while out in public, and can often be seen maintaining a subtle distance from her husband to prove sheaposs more than capable of doing it on her own. In the past, Kate could be seen positioning her hands in front of her, which is another self-reassuring gesture which signies feelings of anxiousness. But, these days, the Duchess is regularly seen making what is known as open palm gestures, which signies confidence, openness, genuineness and honesty. The dference in how she holds her hands during engagements suggest that she has grown into the large shoes that come with being an established member of the Royal Family, Stanton concluded.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

He says it’s possible to make over £ every month especiallyyou live in a city or near a tourist attraction.He told Express : ”If you have a space in a bustling place, such as central London, with costly car parks, or near an airport or tourist attraction, you can earn a lot more than you wouldyou rented out your space in a suburban location. “These days, with bills on the rise, every penny counts so that extra money might pay for extra groceries, perhaps a treat, such as a cinema trip, or maybe a few drinks at the local pub, or a takeaway, that otherwise, you may not have been able to afford.” Al says that he knows not everyone has a parking space and instead he recommends market research as it pays around £ per hour. The blogger explains: “There are many ways you can earn a few extra pounds, my favourites are taking part in market research projects, as you could earn up to £ an hour.  “I’ve also made extra money by working for food delivery companies which currently aren’t as profitable, due to the cost of fuel, but are still profit makers. “You could take on a lodger, rent out your garden to campers, rent your house out to photographers or film-makers or earn extra cash by picking fruit when in season. “Oryou have a skill such as graphic design you could offer your services through online s such as Fiverr.” Al also shares tips for saving money such as taking advantage of yellow sticker bargains to save up to  per cent on the normal selling price. He said: “Competition for the bargains is fierce, so they can’t be relied on to always save you money on your groceries, but when you do get some deals, they can save you some money, and by making sure you make good use of what you have found, you can stretch your food budget.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

Now the cottage at her much-loved retreat in the Scottish Highlands has been fitted with a £, lt. She will also have a new security gate, a state-of-the-art intercom system and a number of news CCTV cameras installed into the property. Palace officials have moved to fit the lt the after speculation the Queen has been struggling with her mobility.She is having dficulty walking her beloved corgis, and needs a walking stick on the occasions she does take them out.The Lton Trio lt is the largest in its range, reports The Sun.“For many years we have thought it would be the perfect place for the Queen to spend more time when she’s older, a source said.Itaposs one of her favourite places in the country. “With the proper lt and now this new security, it can effectively be sealed off so she can spend much more time there quietly in her late nineties.”  Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she understands why the Queen is keen to spend more time on her Balmoral Estate. “Craigowan is one of the Queenaposs favourite homes, the royal expert said. She loves being there. “The idea of making it easier for her so she can spend more time there in the future is a great idea. “It’s a big, big house. The security makes it very safe. “It makes perfect sense. It’s a home she has always enjoyed and it gives her a bit of independence. The Queen could miss more key events such as Royal Ascot and Garter Day, it has this week been suggested.She pulled out of attending the Commonwealth Day service on Monday, a decision understood to be related to her comfort rather than a specic illness. She now regularly uses a stick and remarked during a recent Windsor audience “Well, as you can see, I can’t move”. Her Majesty has also just recovered from a bout of Covid and spent more than three months resting on doctors’ orders from October and only carrying out light duties after an overnight stay in hospital for tests. Editor of Majesty magazine, Joe Little, has suggested the head of state could be absent from key events in the royal calendar.

If Westminster Abbey wasn’t possible, it makes you wonder whether St Paul’s Cathedral will be possible during the main Jubilee celebrations. “Garter, Royal Ascot, big ceremonial events that involve her normally getting in and out of carriages and getting dressed up, I just feel that’s not going to be possible in the future. “But you know, a lot can happen between now and then and so we will think positive thoughts.” He added: “The programme will be pretty sparse. The Palace is clearly going to look at what’s planned and commit to as little as possible because the problem is obviously to do with mobility.

After Morag was given to the animal charityaposs Worcester and Mid Worcestershire branch by her previous owner, the RSPCA was inundated with adoption offers from all over the world.An appeal was sent out by staff at the charity and it saw a social media post being shared over , times to help find her special retirement home. Carers of the moggy received offers from Australia, Japan and the USA despite fears her advancing age and slightly scruffy appearance may put adopters off. But now, the cat who the equivalent of  in human years and is believed to be the oldest cat ever to come into the group’s care, has found a new home close to charityaposs branch in Worcester.  Her new owners have said her favourite pastimes are sleeping, mooching about in the garden and upstairs and eating and loves being picked up for a cuddle. Ned Cotton, who manages the rehoming centre, said: “We were absolutely overwhelmed by the response to our appeal for a retirement home for Morag. “Offers of homes came in from Michigan, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania as well as Australia and Japan. “People also sent in gts and toys and we were so touched with all the messages we received wishing her well. “We never thought for one moment that her story would take off like it did, but a -year-old cat looking for a retirement home to live out the remainder of her days seemed to resonate with people and we were inundated with interest and offers of homes for her.“We’re delighted that she’s found a wonderful home to call her own and we know she’s going to be thoroughly pampered and much loved there, just as she deserves.” The branch has already found homes for seven elderly cats with a combined age of  this year - Violet , Joy , Angel , Holly , Teddyand siblings Barbara and Bernard .

During the three and half hour flight, operated by Jet, Kevin and Samantha McCuillion, felt like they had their own private plane as they ed from the sunshine destination in Greece. The couple were flying back to Manchester in July  and jested with cabin crew staff that they “needed more leg room”.They flew out with Ryanair for a weekaposs holiday in Corfu and wanted to extend their stay and booked new flights home with Jet.After arriving at the the airport on the Saturday night they realised no other passengers were around.Sam, , told the Manchester Evening News: “It was unbelievable, obviously Covid was still a thing at the time.I never thought I would travel alone in a plane.When we went to check in for the flight we thought it was a bit odd that nobody was around, there still weren’t any other passengers at passport control and I started to get a bit panicky. “I wonderedsomething was wrong and our flight had been cancelled or we were late, the airport was so quiet but the staff assured us everything was ok.It was getting later and later and past the departure time. Then the shuttle bus arrived to take us to the plane and we were the only ones on board - we thought we were just late for the flight. “Then we got to the plane and went up the steps, the captain was there with two flight attendants and they told us we were the only ones going on the plane.  The captain said he would tell us all the information, where we flying over and things like that, at the front of the plane instead of making an announcement. “He then said once we’d taken off we can do whatever we like and treat the plane as our own private jet - he said we could run up and down the aisle and do what we wanted. The crew told the couple that since they had toto Manchester anyway, they decided not to cancel the flight, in spite of the lack of demand.Sam, who works as a clerk for the NHS, added: “It was amazing, the staff were lovely, they gave us champagne to drink, sweets to eat, we didn’t have to pay for anything.We didn’t actually run up and down but we laughed and joked with the attendants, we kept saying that we needed more leg room. We still had to wear masks though.“It was such an incredible experience and I don’t think it would happen again, it’s like winning the lottery. It was actually quite bizarre, at one point I dozed off and when I woke up I wondered where everyone was. “When we arrived at Manchester the airport was empty too, it was around am. We got to passport control and the guy from border force looked at us and askedthere was anyone . “We told him what happened and he couldn’t believe it, he said that would never happen to him.I think it was a Covid thing, my friend had recently flown to Portugal and there were only ten people on her flight and I thought that was unbelievable - then we ended up with a whole plane to ourselves. “We had originally flown with Ryanair, but we paid an extra £ for the tickets with Jet  when we extended the stay - £ for a  seater plane all to ourselves.We’re going back again this summer and it’s a place we’ve been to many times, I can’t wait to show them all what happened.” A spokesman from Jet said: “We are delighted that Kevin and Samantha got to experience our VIP customer service in true style.Due to the traffic light system in place for international travel at the time, customers had only just been able to start travelling to Corfu again, meaning flights departing from Manchester were very busy but flights back were much quieter.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Private jetsJetOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We all feel tired occasionally but ongoing issues with getting some shuteye can cause an increased risk of heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure and strokes. So how do you know when it’s appropriate, and necessary, to see a doctor about fatigue or other sleep related issues  Itaposs World Sleep Day, anditaposs been a while since you got a restful night because of your sleep habits, it might be time to seek medical help, says the Daily Record.Here, GPs share five signs and five symptoms to never ignore. Heavy snoringIt might seem harmless but heavy snoring might be a sign of sleep apnoea.“This is an often-missed cause of poor sleep, responsible for chronic tiredness during the day, and even road traffic accidentssufferers fall asleep at the wheel,” says GP Dr Claire Morrison, a medical advisor for MedExpress . “It’s caused by the throat repeatedly closing off during sleep, making oxygen levels fall, and resulting in frequent waking. It’s most common in those who are overweight and who have a thick neck.”  Other signs include waking with a dry mouth and or headache, and feeling very tired and irritable during the day, she says.Or your partner might notice long pauses between breaths when you’re asleep, and then a gasping or choking sound when breathing resumes. While mild cases don’t always need to be treated, in extreme cases sleep apnoea can be dangerous – the NHS notes a higher chance of having a stroke and a serious accident caused by tiredness.Extreme tiredness all the time It could be a sign of anaemia, says Dr Ross Perry, a GP and medical director of Cosmedics . “Other symptoms [of anaemia] include a lack of energy, pale looking skin, headache, dizziness, light headedness, cold hands and feet and brittle nails.” Extreme tiredness can also be a key sign of undiagnosed or insufficiently treated thyroid disease, he adds. The condition occurs as a result of a decrease in thyroid hormone production. “You may sleep more than usual but still feel completely exhausted. At times, you may fall asleep during the day or very quickly at night. In the morning, you may find it dficult to get out of bed.  “Extreme tiredness [also] could be a symptom of coeliac disease, and for some, it may be the only symptom,” says Perry. “The gut damage caused by coeliac disease results in poorer absorption of essential food nutrients involved in energy metabolism, including iron, folic acid and vitamin B.” Restless legs This is a nervous system condition associated with an uncomfortable “tingling or fizzing sensation” in the legs, eased only by moving the legs constantly, says Morrison. “It tends to be worse in the evenings and at night, sometimes making it impossible to sleep properly. It can affect the arms too.”It’s thought to be caused by a lack of the dopamine chemical in the brain, she explains, and it can be triggered by a number of underlying causes – so it’s important to work out what. It may be come about during pregnancy or happen without any obvious reason at any age, though women are twice as likely as men to develop it and it’s also more common in middle age. However, restless legs may also be triggered by “iron deficiency, kidney impairment, diabetes, under-active thyroid, fibromyalgia or Parkinson’s disease”.“Drugs which aggravate the condition include anti-histamines, anti-sickness medication, and anti-depressants, so do tell your doctor about your symptoms before being prescribed anything,” Morrison says. A complete loss of interest in sex “[For men] testosterone deficiency is another common problem associated with tiredness and one of the trademark symptoms of low testosterone in men is chronic fatigue – the type of tiredness that doesn’t improve after rest,” explains Perry.  It can be part of the normal ageing process – testosterone levels are likely to decrease in all men with age , so interest in sex may decline slightly too. “However, it’s not normal for testosterone levels to get so low that fatigue impacts daily activities or for there to be a complete loss of interest in sex, so do visit your GP,” he adds. Mental health concerns affecting sleep It goes without saying that it’s worth chatting to your GPyou’re struggling, but many mental health conditions can cause dficulty sleeping, so it’s not uncommon for issues to come to light at night. “There is a close link between sleep and mental health, and poor sleep can aggravate mental illness, so it’s very important to address sleep problems early on,” says Morrison. “Mental health problems that commonly affect sleep include depression, anxiety, stress, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder, for example.” Signs of mental illness include low mood, excessive worrying, tearfulness, irritability, low self esteem, lack of motivation, inability to concentrate, intrusive thoughts, loss of pleasure in le, poor appetite, and or binge-eating, she adds. “You may benefit from talking therapy such as ‘cognitive behavioural therapy’, and or medication, but make sure your doctor knows about the insomnia, as some anti-depressants can help promote sleep, whereas others may make it worse and are best avoidedpossible.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSInsomniaPrescriptionsSleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Households in Canton, Cardf received a letter this week requesting a £ annual service fee to maintain Riverside Park. The letter was sent to every property on The Mill estate which is home to around  flats and houses.It claims that each address will not be paying more than  th of the cost of the park, reports WalesOnline. Andthere there were  payments of £, this would equate to £,. The park, which opened in July , consists of a simple wooden climbing frame, a picnic table, a bench and two bins.  Residents at The Mill entered into a service charge agreement for maintenance of the estate when they completed on their purchase. But many property owners said they were not consulted about the addition of the park, nor the service cost that would come with it. A letter sent to residents at the time reads: The service charge year shall run for a period of  months from  April in every year. We are notying you of the estimated Service Charge, which is £.for the period covering  April  to  March  in relation to your property. Please note that this is an estimate only of the service charge payable this service charge year.  Ben Jordan owns his property in The Mill and has lived there for over two years. He said: Weaposve just received another letter where we are going to get a £-a-year fee for a park somewhere, which I have never seen, apparently, itaposs just a little wooden frame by the river. And that letter has gone to every property, which is  properties, so thataposs £, a year to maintain one wooden frame. He said it felt like the developer was trying to take advantage and hope people might not notice because of all the other rising costs. Mr Jordan said: This was the first I had heard about it, the only reason I know about the park at all is the letter telling me about it.Iaposve gone and found out more about it and itaposs one little climbing frame, I donapost know why that costs £, a year to maintain. Iaposm , I work from home, I live alone, I have no reason to use the park. I know I will never use it. I have no need for a small climbing frame. EvenI did have kids, itaposs not a very good one anyway.  Fellow householder Josh Jenkins said: I knew that there was a park there, but in terms of it being our responsibility to fund or look after it, this is the first I have heard of it. When we were going through the process of moving in, we were told there would be a service charge but we were told it would be going specically to a company called aposGround Solutionsapos and they would be doing the grounds maintenance of the entire estate. A spokesperson for Tirion Group said: The requirement for the Riverside Park was determined as part of the planning consent for the development of The Mill.  It was considered by Cardf City Council and all other stakeholders that the provision would benefit the community now and in the future. It added: The service charge is an estimate and made up of certain regular costsand also provisions for the longer term maintenance and upkeep of the whole of the Riverside Park and amenities.

The birds have not be been allowed outdoors since November over fears of avian flu outbreaks.Any eggs that will be sold in shops will have to have a sticker or label on it saying they are barn eggs - which is to explain they have been produced by hens housed indoors. There were more than  reported outbreaks of avian flu this winter in England as officials said it was the largest-ever outbreak of avian flu”. The UK government had ordered that birds reared for meat and eggs need to be kept indoors since November to reduce the risk of outbreaks.  This means that because they have been indoors for so long the birdsapos eggs can no longer be labelled free-range. This rule applies to all birds. Farmers were hoping the government were going to lt the housing order next week but after more avian flu outbreaks it is remaining in place. Suffolk-based egg producer Daniel Brown, who has more than , free-range hens, says they are coping well indoors. He told the: We’ve given them extra things in the shed-like hay and grit to give them things to peck at and keep them amused.”“A chicken won’t be bothered about not going outside in December and January, but when it’s nice in May they’ll want to be out late into the evening.He says he hopes the order is lted once the weather starts to warm up.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email .Avian flu outbreaks have spread across Europe overwinter as France is trialling a potential vaccine. However, it has proven tricky because of the numerous strains. Some countries have banned importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The -week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible.”  The British Retail Consortium said supermarkets would be providing signage to explain the change to consumers, but “when the current measures are lted, eggs will go back to being free-range”. Aimee Mahony, the National Farmers’ Union’s chief poultry adviser, said: “Shoppers may notice dferent labels on egg packs explaining the eggs have been laid by hens temporarily housed to protect their health and welfare. “Once the risk levels have reduced and the housing measures have been lted by Defra, birds will be able to go outside again.” The Mirror contacted Defra for a comment.

BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes said: “Our settled weather is due to this big area of high pressure.“We do have a weather front coming in on Sunday and Monday, very weak affair, could bring an odd shower but the emphasis nevertheless remains on an extended run of dry weather with lots of sunshine in the forecast as well. It is going to be mild for the time of year.” BBC weather colleague Helen Willetts said that there may be some frost first thing in the morning on Saturday but after that it will feel “really quite warm”.  “.C in West Sussex it was the warmest day of the year so far , no surprise really because the March sunshine is strengthening and there was barely [any] cloud to block that sunshine out during the course of Friday and it will be a similar story through the day ahead,” said Ms Willets. “But a chilly start on Saturday and some patchy fog around. So the frost is more likely across northern and eastern areas not as widespread as Friday morning and there will still be some pockets around.” There will be be a breeze about on Saturday, especially on the eastern side of the country, but it will be a day to be outdoors and enjoy the sun.  Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin “A cracking day on Saturdayyou like sunny skies, there are plenty of blue skies up and down the land thanks to high pressure.”He said that the hottest temperatures are set to be in Scotland where it could hit C. “Temperatures will be well above average inland in the sunshine ... C, C maybe in Cardf and Glasgow, said Mr Deakin.  That breeze though will be more noticeable on the east coast, even here the temperatures are above average but feeling a little fresher C or C compared to Friday’s values. The top temperature actually likely to be across the Highlands of Scotland where we could easily get to C or possibly squeak up to C for the first time this year.” UK forecast for the next  days Fine, dry and mostly sunny today, but also windy. Today: Fine, dry and bright with plenty of sunshine. Windy though, especially in the south and west. Feeling pleasantly warm in the sunshine and out of the wind in many areas, though perhaps quite chilly in some North Sea coastal areas. Tonight: Turning chilly this evening and then dry but quite windy with mostly clear skies overnight. Colder than last night with a touch of frost in some rural and upland areas. Sunday: Most parts dry with good spells of sunshine. Cloudier at times over East Anglia and far southeast England where a little showery rain is possible. Breezy and colder than today. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Chance of early showers in the east on Monday. Otherwise, widely fine and dry with plenty of sunshine for most. A cold start for most on Monday before turning warmer.

Forecasters are expecting temperatures to get up to C in Wales and the south east of England on Saturday and are predicting there will “barely be a cloud in the sky for the vast majority”.The spell of warm weather follows on from a chilly, foggy morning for many, with the mercury having sunk as low as -C for some in the Glens of Scotland this morning.A yellow weather warning for thick fog was also in place in parts of Wales and western England.  However, the mist has cleared, making way for a bright, bright day for many across the UK today. Temperatures are expected to peak at C today in Edinburgh, C in Cardf and C in Liverpool. And Londoner are in for an unseasonably warm afternoon, with the mercury expected to rise up to C.Through the day on Friday, lots of blue sky and plenty of sunshine,” Met Office meteorologist Claire Nasir said.Ms Nasir said conditions may get a little hazy towards the west of Scotland as more high cloud was seen there and a breeze developed across the Western Isles. However, it was expected to remain warm and dry throughout much of the day. Temperatures would come in around C or C for Scotland and Northern Ireland while they could rise up to C or C across mid-Wales down the south east of England.  Ms Nasir said it would be a “bright end to the working week”. Saturday could be “quite breezy” in the east, but would be warm in the afternoon with the mercury reaching highs of C in England. In Northern Scotland, it could be even warmer, with temperatures getting up to C. BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor said there would barely be a cloud in the sky for the vast majority.” Sunday would be a little cooler, he said, though still fine and dry with some sunshine. Forecasters also thought the sunshine was here to stay, with BBC Weather having predicted the start of next week would be fine, with temperatures approaching C in London by Wednesday. And Netweather senior forecaster Jo Farrow said: The ongoing theme for the next week is more settled, dry weather with a more southerly flow. That means temperatures will be higher, into the high teens and even low s on the cards.

And, as every Brit will tell you, thereaposs only one way to make a cup of tea, and thataposs by boiling a kettle - although we wonapost go into the whole milk or water first debate. So you can understand just how horried people have been after an American woman went viral for making her boyfriend a cup of tea the American way - and it really is quite disturbing. Alex Murphy, who is from the US but currently lives in London, filmed herself making a cuppaapos for boyfriend Paul Klein, before sharing it to TikTok. In the clip, the -year-old can be seen putting cold tap water into a mug with a teabag inside, before adding milk and sugar, and sticking it in the microwave to heat. Alex then removes the teabag, gives it a final stir and presents it to -year-old Paul, who was just as horried as us. Paul took one sip on the cup of tea and immediately put the mug down, with a look of repulsion on his face. What is that  That is disgusting. Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude – but that is not a cup of tea, he told her.  He is left horried when she reveals she microwaved it, and throws the mug on the ground.Alex, who previously appeared on Dancing on Ice in  with Joe Swash, shared the video on TikTok, where it has since been viewed more than  million times.That was an appropriate response. The real red flag is how you made that tea, one Reddit user commented, while another added: No way he should leave you at once. A third commented: That was so painful to watch, you make me sick, and a fourth added: Throwing the cup was justied. If you say otherwise clearly youaposre not British. Another critic said: When she used tap water I SCREAMED. Despite the controversy, Alex insists it was the way she was taught to make tea – and she hopes the British public will forgive her. This is how I grew up making it. It was a one-off – Paul usually makes the tea, she said. He hated it. Everyone hated it. I never expected how many people would be so triggered.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The then-teen was so terried she didnapost tell anyone, until she woke up in agonising pain at am one morning and was forced to tell her dad - who delivered the baby  minutes later.In a series of clips on TikTok, posted from her handle @therealelwoods, Elle told her followers: I found out through my nutritionist - not my GP - and I just didnapost tell anyone I was pregnant.Just a few weeks later, the teen woke up in the early hours in a lot of pain and asked her dad to get her some painkillers - but she quickly realised she was already in labour, and all of a sudden half of the babyaposs head [was] already out. Rising to the occasion, Elleaposs shocked dad quickly phoned emergency services, but with the nearest hospital a -minute drive away, operators told him heaposd have to deliver the baby himself. [He] moved me to the en-suite as that was the largest tiled area and they put down a whole heap of towels, she explained in a follow up clip. My uncle - my dadaposs brother - was living with us and he was in charge of keeping my sister with Downaposs Syndrome occupied with other things so she didnapost know what was going on. Dad said it was quite quick. Iaposve had a second child since and I laboured really quick with him as well. Elle continued: When the ambulance came [ minutes later], they packed me up and took me to hospital. I donapost remember a lot because I did go into shock and I lost a whole lot of blood. Fortunately, both Elle and her daughter - who is now  years old - were both fine, and the girlaposs grandfather decided he would become a full-time granddad so his daughter could go back to school while he took care of the baby. Elleaposs daughter - Belle - is now the best of friends with her granddad, and she has since welcomed a second child with her husband.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

All in all, Adrian says it took him around  minutes to heat up the oil, with another three minutes needed to fry the eggs to his liking. He claims his wallet-friendly hack worked very well indeed. Adrian said: “I came up with this hack because I was thinking with all the uncertainty in the world right now what will happenthe gas gets cut off – or become so expensive we couldn’t afford it. So I thought of an alternative and it worked well. Adrianaposs followers have been left impressed by his innovative thinking at a time when many are looking to cut everyday costs, with one person hailing the hack “genius” and “really clever”. Many have noted that the tip is very timely for a lot of people, with a second person commenting, “This how the whole UK gonna be living in April. Another wrote: “We may have to resort to this actionprices keep going up, while a fourth said they would be saving this video in my head for rainy days.

The woman, who posted her story anonymously, explained she lives in a housing compound made up of  families, and while most of her neighbours are very polite, the new arrivals have been disrupting the balance.She said: I live in a compound with  houses altogether. Four weeks ago a new family moved into the only remaining empty unit. They have  small children a boy around  and a girl around . Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. All the kids that already lived here play on the main road that runs through the compound as it is private access only and therefore relatively safe. But they always make sure to stay away from driveways and not hit anyone’s car with their football tennis ball shuttlecock etc. It’s nice seeing the kids play together after school and they are all very polite and move out of the waysomeone is driving through the street. However, this new family leaves their toys including scooters and bikes and even a cricket bat lying in the middle of the road. The kids also throw their balls into garages. The mum even claims the children have thrown bits of pebble at her windows at night and woke up her two-month-old baby in the process. She initially confronted the parents about their kidsapos behaviour but nothing has changed - so sheaposs now reported them to their landlord along with video proof.  She added: They have snuck up my driveway right next to my windows and thrown bits of pebble at the window and then screamed when my husband went to check what was going on, which woke up my  month old newborn. After  weeks of this, I went to the new neighbours and asked them to keep their kids under control. The we told me their nanny cleans up after the kids , so there is no problem. I got frustrated and started taking photos every time the new kids left a mess and blocked the road. I sent that, along with a video of them sneaking into my garage and driveway, to the landlord who said he would take care of it. Since sending the proof to the landlord, the neighbours have been better behaved - but are furious that an anonymous person reported them. The woman said: I noticed that they have been better behaved this week and casually brought it up with my other neighbour, who said that the new neighbours had received a warning from the landlord and were angry that someone had reported them. Now I am wonderingI should have tried to talk to them again instead of just straight away reporting them. Commenters on the Reddit post were firmly on the mumaposs side though, as many of them pointed out sheaposd already tried talking to her neighbours and was dismissed - leaving her with no other choice but to go to the landlord. One said: You talked to them once and the mom brushed you off. If you exclude the mess they are making, they are still throwing stuff at your house deliberately which could break something. These kids are old enough to know better. While another added: You did talk to them. It went in one ear and out the other. Reporting it to the landlord was the proper thing to do.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditNeighbours from hellUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old, who is from Poole, made the discovery after initially being impressed with pictures of the £, property and wanting to see more in a virtual tour. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. When she opened up the tour option, the psychology student was shocked to find the ft unexpected house guest lurking in the otherwise empty living room. She said: I was looking at houses in that area and saw that one and had a look through the pictures. It looked alright and I saw it had a virtual tour so I used that to have a better look around. It was a bit of a shock going in and seeing a weird religious statue in one of the rooms - I just thought it was really funny. Because I was doing the virtual tour it was literally like walking into the room and there was just this thing in the corner. It kind of felt like the start of a horror movie - itaposs like a warning sign that the house is haunted or that something bad happened there. Itaposs almost like itaposs the statueaposs house and he has to stay there - maybeyou move him something bad will happen. It probably comes to le at night.  After virtually coming face-to-face with the bizarre figure, the student tweeted about her discovery and said she felt unsettled by the religious statue. She wrote: So I was doing a virtual house tour on Rightmove and I aposwalkedapos into one room and was greeted by this thing. Holy s**t. Commenters shared in Jessapos horror as they said they were convinced the statue was haunted. And one even drew the comparisons to Nicolas Cage, writing: Is that Nic Cage   The seller of the property has insisted the statue isnapost haunted and has actually had a positive impact on their lives since they picked it up in Bali, Indonesia - evendoes sometimes scare their house guests. They said: Itaposs a carving of St Francis - the patron saint of children and animals. We found it in Bali when buying furniture for our reclaimed furniture shop and shipped it back - it was so unusual compared to all the other Indonesian carvings. It had a time at our old house and then a time at a church in Bournemouth. We are now undecided on what to do with it so it ended up in the house. It will be the last thing we move as it weighs about kg. We bought it and it took us on a very positive journey afterwards so definitely more of a good thing in our lives. But it also definitely has a shock factor - it nearly made one of our painter contractors jump out of his skin when he saw it.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .

But one woman on TikTok was less than impressed when she discovered a barista at Starbucks was flirting with her after he left a smooth message on her coffee cup without her noticing.In a video, the woman showed off the cup, which had secret message written on it alongside an arrow that travelled all the way down to the bottom of the cup. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. At the bottom, text was circled which would usually tell customers: Careful, the beverage youaposre about to enjoy is extremely hot. But instead, the Starbucks employee had crossed out several of the words so that the message read: Careful, youaposre extremely hot.The woman, who posts on TikTok under the username @chance_twins alongside her twin sister, was left red-faced by the encounter and indicated she wouldnapost be going back to the coffee shop because she couldnapost face seeing the barista again.She captioned the video: What just happened at Starbucks   Never going back there. Commenters on the video were ided over the gesture, as while some thought it was cute, others wondered how many other people the barista had written the same message to. One person said: That was smooth, not going to lie. While another added: Itaposs cute, girls say guys never do anything. He just put his heart out to you. But a third found the message suspicious, as they wrote: Iaposm wondering how many other girls he did that to. The Mirror has contacted Starbucks for comment.Meanwhile, one Starbucks employee recently shared the embarrassing truth behind the drive-thru that had us regretting every decision we ever made while sitting in our cars.The woman, known only as Grace, revealed that Starbucks employees can actually see you when you place your drive-thru order, as they have a camera set up that watches the first station.

While it is uncleartheyaposre yet being used in Ukraine, itaposs not just tanks and guns at their disposal, the Daily Star report. Amid the tragic death toll of the on-going war, we have already seen the Russian military roll out some fearsome high-tech weapons. From thermobaric missiles to aposdecoyapos darts, President Vladimir Putin will seemingly stop at nothing to flex his military muscle.Russia has been quietly working on high-tech suits for some years - and could be preparing to introduce even more of them to the conflict. The Russian army has previously trialled aposactive poweredapos exoskeletons which can be strapped to soldiers to give them lethal cyborg powers. The electric suits are designed to augment and enhance troops. They can help soldiers carry much heavier loads and can even give machine guns deadly accuracy over long-distances.Oleg Faustov, from Russian Army defence contractor TsNiiTochMash, said the suits will make ordinary human servicemen far more lethal. He said: We have already held trials for the prototype of the active exoskeleton.  It really enhances a serviceman’s physical abilities. “For example, the tester was able to shoot from a machine-gun only with one hand and accurately hit targets.” The suits could theoretically change the face of warfare – turning men into part-machines, with the accuracy to match a computer. If deployed in the conflict with Ukraine, the suits could make Russian soldiers a real danger as the war with Ukraine shows no sign of stopping. The Russian military is reportedly firing decoy missiles into populated areas of Ukraine to try and bamboozle the Ukrainian military.According to US security officials, Moscow is using fake dart-shaped missiles for the first time in the conflict, which is now in its nd day.They believe the decoys are the reason why Ukraineaposs air defence systems have found it so tricky to stop Russiaaposs short-range ballistic missiles which have reportedly been used on civilians in hospitals and bomb shelters in Kyiv and Kharkiv.Since the start of Putinaposs invasion, images have circulated on social media of the dart-shaped munitions which many people initially thought were cluster bombs or miniature weapons.

However, a new iant has emerged and cases are up by %British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Image: REUTERSopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments For weeks, the politicians were very quiet about Covid, pretending it’s gone away.Then ministers suddenly got busy, lting all travel restrictions from today. We’re now in a free-for-all. Fingers crossed, because it’s a gamble with the nation’s health and the lives of the vulnerable. No mandatory masks on planes, trains and buses, or in schools or shops. That sounds correct, but the abolition of official rules brings confusion and uncertainty. In this do-it-yourself pandemic policy, who knows how to behave Boris Johnson, who uses the Ukraine war as a covering for his face , wants us to believe it’s all over. It isn’t. Driven by the super-infectious Omicron BA iant, new cases are up by %. There are , in hospital, with  on ventilators. Deaths on Wednesday numbered , bringing the seven-day total to . Protection gained by booster jabs is fast disappearing, and we’re still waiting for the vital fourth dose. It may come soon for the over s and vulnerable, but not until later in the year for the general population. With a hundred deaths being recorded every day, this feels like Covid complacency.And the Government is dragging its feet over the independent pandemic inquiry. It’s unlikely to take evidence before the winter – and not report until at least two years.This deliberate delay takes the verdict on the Great Tory Pandemic Bungle until well after the general election, thereby letting Boris Johnson off the hook. I don’t know about Covid being endemic, but we are being asked to live with endemic political corruption. *********** In , King James I described smoking tobacco as loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs.

My job is my dogs. These are all French Bulldogs - my favourite breed for  years now.I didnapost believe a war could start. The first week I thought that everything would end quickly, then shells began to fall near the house and I realised that I needed to save my four-legged children.I took the first batch of dogs,  dogs and  puppies, to Poland on March .

The sight of the Ukranian people desperately seeking safety in neighbouring countries evokes scenes in Europe from the Second World War, as Hitler#s forces advanced, and later refugee crises sparked by the more recent Balkan conflict.As reported in this edition the women, children and elderly are heading in one direction # while the young men, and no doubt plenty of women too, are going the opposite way to defend their country from Putin.In the midst of such suffering and bravery, it is heartening to hear of so many Argyll folk joining a huge Europe-wide effort to help those forced to flee their homes.We would encourage our readers to support this cause in whatever way you can.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country.

The smell of food cooking on the BBQ, the lingering warmth in the air and the beautul long nights that make you forget winter is even a thing – total bliss!As these warmer months approach, we all look for ways to improve our outdoor space. Whether that’s upgrading the BBQ, investing in some new garden furnitureor even treating yourself to a fun new edition.One of the best editions to any garden is of course a hot tub. What can compare to the total luxury of sitting in your own hot tub, gazing up at the stars But of course, hot tubs are definitely on the higher end of luxury, and not something most people can afford. Hard shell hot tubs can be upwards of £, which isn’t ideal.So what about inflatable hot tubsThey are much cheaper to buy and easy to set up. But are they worth it Lay-Z-Spa Helsinki review We decided to put them to the test! We tested out a Lay-Z-Spa model, one of the best rated suppliers of inflatable hot tubs, here’s what we thought.Helsinki Lay-Z-SpaThe set upLay-Z-Spa boasts an effortless set up, and I must say, the ease of which I was able to set this up had me rethinking my journalism career and question one in engineering instead .All the items were packed securely and easy to set up, with instructions and accompanying videos online to help.The instructions are picture-based, which can be a bit of a challenge but pairing them with the online videos really helped.In the box, you get everything you need to set up: the tub itself, the pump, an inflatable lid and all filter attachments.The tub itself inflated in what felt like seconds, and then it was just organising the pump and filters.To protect the tub, I put down a protective mat underneath. Lay-Z-Spa stocks a few ietiesof these and it made me feel much safer setting up the tub in my garden.Excited puppy didnt slow things down, too much... The mat slots together like a children’s play mat, nice and easily. Even when you have a zoomy-ing puppy accompanying you..removeWith the puppy safely stowed inside, the next thing to do was fill it up! The entire set up process took me under  minutes, and then the hose was left to fill the tub which took just under  hours.Lay-Z-Spa advises that tubs could take between - hours to heat up when first filled. Being that mine was set up on quite a standard cold, Scottish day, it took closer to the  hours.Once filled I sorted out a shock dose of chemicalswhich is highly recommended when you first fill your tub.Blowing up and filling up Success! The tub was up, filled and I must admit, I was feeling very proud of myself. If I can set it up, anyone can...We rate the ease of set up  !DesignThe Helsinki model is one of the brand’s most popular tubs, and we can see why! Despite being inflatable, its attractive drop stitch design gives it a hard shell look that will fit in with all gardens.Its unique Nordic design gives it a realistic wooden print design, you would never know it wasn’t a hard shell tub.The material is also sturdy and durable. If you have quite a busy garden space, you don’t need to feel nervous about damaging the tub or ripping the material.On top of the hot tub pump there is also two convenient drink holders, so your drink won’t overheat while you bask in the hot bubbles.Drink holders keep your beverage from getting too hot in the tub Its beautul design adds a splash of character to a garden, so we rate the Helsinki design  .Heating the tubEager to spend our nights relaxing in the bubbles, we decided to set the tub up in March, a Scottish March where temperatures lulled around  degrees Celsius.Despite the low temperatures, heating the tub did not take as long as expected.On the first fill, it took  hours for water temperatures to rise from  degrees to . The tub was then kept at  degrees and raised to on those chilly night dips.The lid is stylish and effective!When not in use during the week the tub was set down to  degrees Celsius for energy efficiency. Heating it back up to enjoyable temps took just a few hours of preparation, even in the colder weather.The tub’s insulated cover is definitely to credit for this. The inflatable lid helps to maintain water temperature when the spa has been switched off and helps it heat faster.Heating the Helsinki tub proved to be incredibly simple, so we rate it  .In the tubAfter waiting the advised  hours after a shock dose and getting the temperature to a balmy  degrees it was time for the first dip! And the timing was perfect with my husband and I having tested positive for Covid- hours earlier, what  were we to do but enjoy a long, relaxing soak Bliss! Lay-Z-Spa has an incredible range of accessoriesto make your hot tub experience so much more enjoyable. We opted for a hot tub light to add to the ambience of the evening.The touchpad control  for Lay-Z-Spa hot tubs is so easy to use, making the whole process so much more enjoyable. The instructions fully assist with all tools for heating and keeping clean.Having been in many hard shell hot tubs prior to this, I was unsure what an inflatable one would feel like without hard seating areas and bigger machines. However, I was immediately pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the tub and the power of the jets!Despite appearing neat and small, the Helsinki floor is well cushioned and very comfortable and the rigid sides provide excellent comfort for resting against without taking up too much room. The tub is advertised as a - person size and this is definitely accurate sizing.Helsinki control  The Helsinki uses an air jet system to create the bubbles. And it is unlike any other hot tub I have ever been in. The  Airjet Massage System is incredibly powerful and relaxing and has therapeutic bubbles travelling all across the tub. It was bliss!With such a powerful system we worried our neighbours might be getting annoyed, however when one of us ed indoors the sound was barely even noticeable so we enjoyed much longer in the tub without any disturbance to neighbours.We rate use an easy  !OverallIf you’re looking for a hot tub but don’t feel like splashing out too much for a hard shell, we highly recommend the Lay-Z-Spa Helsinki.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Although not responsible for the building, Glasgow City Council took the decision to order the evacuation for public safety reasons.  However, work was already due to get under way before then and the structure, which dates back to the s and was once a training centre for Church of Scotland ministers, was already covered in scaffolding to allow for essential work to go ahead after previous reports found stresses with stonework and that full refurbishment was required. Planning permission for refurbishment work was granted in December .And in January  police were called to the tower after crumbling stonework came crashing down on the pavement below.Residents were told they could be out of their homes for two to three months and as it reaches the halfway they are looking for answers.Dr Clayton, of the Park Action Group, said: “We were told movement sensors placed in one of the Towers had been triggered and the Tower was in danger of uncontrolled collapse.“The council says the building still poses a risk to le but will not release any engineering reports or provide any plan of action for its stabilisation or controlled dismantling.”Dr Clayton said residents have found it impossible to get back into their homes to assess any flood damage after the storm weekend.He added: “I need licences and permits for my daily job and others might need access for medicine for their children, but the council has been strong-armed about access. We still don’t have an update on what two to three months means.“We are extremely concerned and are running into insurance issues as our homes have not be occupied for more than  days andthat tower does fall down and we are not insured then who is liable  We have this huge sword of Damocles or Trinity hanging over us.“We want to know what is the plan of work and when will it be deemed safe to get back into our homes.”Read more: Revealed: Glasgow equal pay row strike dates are confirmedFellow resident and music producer Keith McIvor, of Optimo Music, said his livelihood is affected as his studio is in his home.Mr McIvor, who has worked with artists including Franz Ferdinand and the Manic Street Preachers, said: “After two years of not being able to work due to the pandemic, I now face continued uncertainty due to having no access at all to my music collection or studio equipment, both of which are essential for me to be able to work. I need to get my work out as my financial is desperate post pandemic I have a letime collection of records which are my livelihood. If the tower is so dangerous, then take it down.”  A Glasgow City Council spokesman said they had communicated regularly with residents affected by the exclusion zone around this dangerous building, but while the Trinity Tower is considered a dangerous building, as it currently is, the council is required to protect wider public safety by restricting access to the building.The spokesman added: “It should be understood that the timescale of two to three was given by the owners’ contractor once they had confirmed the scale and nature of the works they would have to carry out to make the building safe. We relayed this information to affected residents, and continue to work with the contractors to ensure people canhome as quickly as possible. Residents have absolutely been givenaccess to collect essential items, and again it should be noted that more regular visits are not feasible given the great increase in risk that this would entail.“The condition and maintenance of the Trinity tower is a matter for the owners of that building, and repair work instructed by them was already underway when our Building Standards team was alerted by their contractors, who were concerned about its condition.”A spokeswoman speaking on behalf of the design team, which includes the owners of the tower and their surveyors, told The Herald all media was being handled by the council as they had put a cordon in place.The spokeswoman declined to comment any further on the nature of repairs being carried out and how long this was likely to take."},{"url":null,"title":"vinyl-tap-pleasures-looking-vintage-records-fair","story":"It had begun in , when Paul Talbut’s uncle bought him a small turntable and a copy of The Monkees’ hit single, I’m A Believer. He quickly became obsessed with The Beatles, an obsession that continues to flourish to this day.Paul’s collection, preserved on wall-to-wall bookshelves in his study in Sydney, Australiaextends to , singles,  LPs and more than  CDs. Factor in what he calls “the valuable stuff” and the entire collection is probably worth more than £,.Ever keen to track down rarities, he “religiously” tracks some  or  UK sellers on eBay almost every day.And then he made a point that every vinyl collector, irrespective of age, can identy with. Asked about the visual side of collecting, Talbut responded: “There is a thrill to holding and owning an album that is dficult to explain to a Spoty user.“I’m sentimental about certain albums bought as a teenager – I want the physical connection to the vinyl and the artwork”.There is a lot of that going on as you read this today, in the games hall of Bellahouston Leisure Centre, as VIP Record Fairs s to Glasgow.Over the course of a few hours, between  and  enthusiasts, from teenagers to grey-haired oldies, after each paying £ for entry, will scour dealers’ tables.It’s always a hypnotic process to watch. Plastic storage boxes of records, many hundreds of them, are being thumbed through as collectors search for specic artists and albums, or perhaps for that impromptu golden find such as a Bob Dylan rarity, or a Japanese import on coloured vinyl of a Rolling Stones classic from the s or some obscure garage act or a group of the Krautrock genre from Germany or maybe a long-forgotten quartet that emerged from America’s prolic west-coast scene that had their moment in the sun before ing to their day jobs.Here and there – and I speak from personal experience – you come across something you first bought as a teenager. “Sentimental” doesn’t even begin to describe it. You suddenly find yourself holding an album that you bought maybe  years ago. The sleeve design, the typeface, the order in which the songs appear – it all comes back in a jolt of memories, some happy, some less so.It’s good to see teens exploring vinyl at these fairs. All is not quite lost to Spoty and other streaming services, you think,younger fans are actively seeking out vinyl. As a bonus, they can often buy records a lot cheaper here than in local record shops – around £ for a standard reissue album against a fiver or a tenner at the fairs.As Rob Lythall, the -something owner of the organisers, VIP Record Fairs, puts it: “The biggest joy is to see new, younger, music fans visiting our events to both buy and sell.”Much has been written about vinyl’s remarkable resurgence. It was reported last month that ’s vinyl sales were at £. million, up . per cent year-on-year compared to £.m in CD sales . On this current growth trajectory, says the music website NME, vinyl will be ahead by the end of this year.In the first six months of , in America,  million vinyl records were sold, generating m in retail revenue – nearly double the amount from the same period in .Dealers come from far and wide to the VIP fair at Bellahouston. Tony Gaughan doesn’t have far to travel, though: at No  London Road, his shop, Blitzkrieg, is close to the Barras and the fabled Barrowland music venue.He has an interesting background, too. Long part of the Glasgow music scene, he has played in bands and is now AR director of the independent record label Neon Tetra Music.Blitzkrieg, which relocated to London Road from a unit in the Savoy Centre, reflects his love of punk music, such as The Ramones and The Clash.As well as punk vinyland memorabilia, Blitzkrieg also sells vintage musical instruments, books, concert set lists and fine art works, and hires out backline – ampliers and drum kits – to young local bands.“I’ve attracted tattoo artists and photographers, and I’m helping to promote their services as well”, says Tony. “It’s all going really well and just the other week we were described as the best record shop in Scotland. I’ve got a huge second-hand punk collection that has come in, including original Sex Pistols, Devo and Vibrators posters, which have been restored and are framed on the walls.“I’m really looking forward to the record fair”, he added. “I’ll be selling lots of brand-new vinyl by acts such as Gang of Four, The Clash, Television, and A Certain Ratio, as well as records by ious Scottish acts... The Bluebells, Hipsway.“All the second-hand vinyl I’ll be selling at the fair has been cleaned and restored. The punk collection I mentioned has some incredible stuff in it too, like a lot of really rare singles in pristine condition. There’s even an EP from the early s by a band from East Kilbride called the Sinister Turkeys.” He laughs. “It’s not the best song I’ve ever heard but it sounds asthey had done a few rehearsals and got the money together to go into the recording studio.“On one website there were just two copies of it for £ each. One with a green cover was £.” And that, it seems, speaks to the steep prices that vinyl, even by obscure Scottish acts, can fetch in today’s market.Tony glances around his shop. “There’s probably too much stuff in here, me being a collector myself”, he observes.“I’ve had to sign up to maybe  or  dferent dealers to get stock. You don’t know what you’re buying, though. Every day is like Christmas – you come in here and open another box of vinyl and seeing stuff by the likes of UK Subs and Durutti Column and you think, ‘I don’t remember ordering that.’”It won’t come as a surprise to learn that Rob Lythall of VIP Record Fairs really knows his music, too.A fan of Northern Soul music, he started buying and selling records in the s. He had a job for a few years, too, as a manager at a building society.“I went to a record fair in Birmingham because I had some spare stock\", he said. \"There were crowds of people outside in the queue and no signs or anything and, as you do, I just thought, ‘bloody hell, I could do this’. So that’s what I did”.VIP Record Fairs staged its first fair back in , in the YMCA in Leicester, Rob’s home town. “I lugged -odd tables up three flights of stairs”, he recalls. “Over time we managed to grow that into  tables at Wembley – the biggest show we have done”.Around  VIP fairs are held every year across the country, in a select list of towns and cities that includes Manchester, Nottingham, Norwich and London.Glasgow is the only Scottish location there, the venues have ranged from the SECC to the Mitchell Library. Bellahouston has now been the host for a few years and will hold witness not only today’s event but also the next two, on June  and October .VIP says that, over the years, hundreds of music fans have given up their job to sell full-time with at its fairs. There’s also this thought-provoking claim: since , “more product has been bought, sold and displayed than any other medium in the world”.“Exactly”, affirms Rob. “When you look at it, we’ve had tens of thousands of record fairs. If you add up all these sales figures – maybe Amazon has beaten us – but, from our point of view, that’s an awful lot of product sold by dealers who hire space from us.“Most of the big record fairs in Europe started when they came in to see what we were doing in England. The guys in, for example, Utrecht [the Mega Record  CD Fair, which has some  dealers, twice a year] came to see what we were doing”.What is the pleasure for him in organising so many fairs  “Obviously, after  years, some of the fun goes out of it”, he says with a laugh, “but at the end of the day it’s great seeing music fans going into a fair, finding what they want and going away, happy as Larry.“It’s great to provide a service for people who’re looking to collect music”, he adds. “It’s hard doing thatyou have a physical shop – and I’ve done that.“You can’t rotate the stock very well but the record-fair model is such that the stock is rotated really well by the time the fair s to Glasgow, or Manchester, or wherever”.Who knows what gems will be uncovered today  There’s only one way to find out...** VIP Record Fair, Glasgow Club, Bellahouston Leisure Centre, Bellahouston Drive, Glasgow.

Officials say the employment rights normally only exist for people who are ordinarily living on Jersey.It is understood there is now an examination over whether the employment rights of the maritime staff relate to where they are contracted or their place or residence.Chris Deeley, a solicitor in the employment team at JMW Solicitors said that while PO may be intending to apply Jersey law to the redundancies, they may still benefit from UK protections.“I imagine there may be a choice of law clause that identies Jersey in those employees’ contracts, in an attempt by PO to disapply English law,\" he said.“However, having a choice of law clause pointing to Jersey does not automatically mean that employees will not benefit from English employment rights. Employment Tribunals will look at the whole circumstances of a person’s employment, and weigh up relevant factors, to decide whether there is a sufficiently strong connection with the UK.“For example,an employee lived in England and was based out of an English port, those factors might lean more towards UK employment law applying, even though their contract said only Jersey law applied. This is especially sothat clause was part of PO’s standard template contract, rather than something that was specically negotiated.“These issues are assessed on a case-by-case basis, so it is dficult to say with any certainty what law will apply. There will, therefore, always be a risk to PO of an employee deciding to fight the issue in a tribunal.”The UK government says it is looking \"very closely\" at the action PO Ferries has taken to seethey broke any laws after it fired its employees, planning to replace them with cheaper agency staff.PO has told staff in a letter to keep quiet about its plan to cut  staff and replace them with agency workers.The chief executive of PO Ferries Peter Hebblethwaite defended the cuts saying that without the changes which will cut crewing costs by %, there was \"no future\" for PO Ferries.PO say they are compensating all  Jersey-contracted staff for lack of notice with enhanced severance packages.\"They are being offered support and being encouraged to access our employee assistance programmethey feel they need it, either now or in the coming days. As part of their package, they are also being offered careers advice and support,\" said Mr Hebblethwaite in his letter to staff.On Thursday it emerged that PO had suspended services for between seven and  days on Cairnryan to Larne, Dover to Calais, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam.Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson had confirmed that senior officials at the Department for Transport had first been informed about the firm’s plan on Wednesday evening but had kept the information within a small group, because of concerns about commercial sensitivity.The spokesperson said ministers were investigating whether PO Ferries broke the law, describing the firm’s behaviour as “extreme”.“We expect companies to treat their employees fairly. It is only in extreme circumstances that employers need to make extreme decisions to secure the future of their businessesall other avenues have failed, including negotiations between employer and employees.“We don’t believe this was the case for PO staff,” he said, adding: “We are looking into this very carefully.”Labour has said that public procurement and taxpayers money, should be used to promote good working practices and decent conditions. The party has pledged that in government it will strengthen these requirements in procurement law.It has also called for the removal of DP World from the UK Government’s Transport Advisory Group, the outlawing of fire and rehire and a ban on other forms of exploitative practices such as zero hour contracts.Mr Starmer said: “PO’s actions are aggressive and immoral.“If one company can est itself of responsibility for its workforce, and the government don’t blink, others have room to do the same.\"We are demanding the Prime Minister grants access to the legal advice the DfT received on whether PO Ferry’s actions constitute a breach of the law, and whether there are legal levers to get the decision reversed.\"Full transparency is vital to prevent anyone  from being subjected to this appalling behaviour. Any government contracts they have should be suspended until this is resolved.\"Both the RMT union and Nautilus have been seeking legal advice on the dismissals conducted on a video conference with no notice in a move to replace existing workers with cheaper agency staff.Seafarers union Nautilus International say they and the RMT union had said they were “actively progressing” their legal response to the “clearly illegal” move.Employment lawyers had warned PO may have broken several laws.In the UK, when  or more employees are proposed to be made dismissed, a -day consultation has to take place and collective redundancy rules apply and the business secretary has to be notied.But PO has confirmed that all the staff are Jersey-contracted - and some union officials believe they were easier to fire as they were part of an \"offshore employment model\".Experts say employing crew in places like Jersey, Guernsey and Singapore is common across the ferry industry and by doing this there are fewer protections for employees.The  staff are understood to have been contracted through some or all of POs five Jersey companies - PO FerriesLimited, PO European FerriesLimited, PO Irish SeaLimited, PO North SeaLimited, and PO Ship ManagementLimited.It was through Jersey-registered PO Ferries, PO North Sea and PO Irish Sea that seafarers’ union Nautilus negotiated a new pay deal for employees in December .Leader of Northern Ireland’s Traditional Unionist Voice Party, Jim Allister said: “It appears PO sought to circumvent our employment laws by having their employee contracts rooted in Jersey.“Going forward, this loophole must be closed by effective legislation. Never again must employees be the victims of such brutal treatment and exploitation.”One legal expert said that while rules regarding employee consultation and trade unions are broadly similar in Jersey to those in the UK, there is one key exception.Where UK-based employers are obliged under the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations to consult with trade unions or other staff groups on key issues that affect them, Jersey employers are under no obligation to consult with employees on any business or employment matter.There are rights over collective redundancies - but government officials say they are directed at Jersey residents.In Jersey, where  or more employees are likely to be made redundant at one establishment within a period of  days or less there is a legal requirement to consult with representatives prior to initiating any inidual consultation.The consultation must begin at least  days before the first of the dismissals takes place.There is also a legal requirement to give advance notice to the Jersey Social Security Minister before any notice is given to employees and or at least  days before the first dismissal takes place.Employers who fail to consult properly may face a claim for additional compensation, called a protective award. The claim for such an award, which could be up to an additional nine weeks pay to each affected employee.Social justice law firm Thompsons, solicitors which is acting for the RMT has said the actions of PO were unlawful under UK legislation and that they were considering all options including employment tribunal claims and High Court proceedings.Neil Todd, the trade union lawyer working on this at Thompsons said it was their view that the employees’ rights would fall under UK employment law, not Jersey.He said:“PO’s sudden decision to fire all  UK staff – via a pre-recorded video call and without a single shred of consultation - is a shocking disregard of the most basic employment law.“The law states thatyou’re dismissing more than  employees, you must consult with them. Aside from the legal requirement for due process to be followed, it’s simple common decency to communicate openly, honestly and in good time with your employees, many of whom will have worked loyally for the company for years.“To blame Covid- for these sackings, when PO took furlough payments and is part of a hugely profitable group of companies, is beyond cynical.“This is a shocking example of a major British employer acting in a wholly atrocious manner - attempting to bypass unions, sack hardworking employees and instead hire staff from agencies who will be underpaid and un-unionised. This is hardly the post-Brexit Britain that the Conservatives promised.“In our view what they did was unlawful and we are considering all options including employment tribunal claims and High Court proceedings.”And Holly Cudbill, an employment lawyer from Blake Morgan, said that PO Ferries actions \"were almost certainly illegal\".Although its boats sail around the world, she believes the firms employees are covered by UK law."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13591806.jpg?type=article-full","title":"queen-20k-lift-fitted-security-upgraded-balmorals-craigowan-lodge","story":"It comes after the monarch spent most of the past two years based at Windsor Castle, with reports suggesting she will never again live at Buckingham Palace.According to reports in The Sun, a new “wheelchair-friendly” lt, security gate, state-of-the-art intercom system and a string of new CCTV cameras are due to be installed at Craigowan Lodge in Aberdeenshire.The -year-old Queen, who typically stays at the lodge twice a year – every April and for two weeks in summer, has been left needing a walking stick following recent health scares.The Queen has been using a walking stick A Balmoral insider said: “For many years we have thought it would be the perfect place for the Queen to spend more time when she’s older.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

Beth Adger.The works will take place between Aghacully Road and Hazelbank Road and will involve the creation of a high friction surface.Cllr. Adger said a deputation from Aughafatten area residents had told her of their fears about speeding in the area.They were fearful that accidents were on the increase and were pleading for something to be done to eradicate the problem.I sought the support of DFIand I’m delighted to receive this week a positive response from them. Work will begin on March .She added: With a long history of proven success in improving road safety and saving lives, high friction surfacing benefits both road users and pedestrians, particularly in dangerous conditions such as adverse weather.High friction surfacing is a material and a process by which road surfaces become less prone to skidding and loss of friction. Instead of a smooth and slippery surface, high friction surfacing creates thousands of tiny contact points, known as a micro-texture. This means that a vehicle’s tyres have more contact with the road, allowing them to better grip the surface and come to a safer stop.

The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London.

But with Baby Carrie, there was nothing. There was just a void.“That’s why I was so keen from early on to give her an identity to ensure she didn’t get lost, anonymised or forgotten about.“When someone is murdered, there’s always a family member saying ‘we want justice’, but for baby Carrie there was nobody,” he said.“We became her advocates, her surrogate family — it felt very personal. If we stopped trying, then who  was going to do it ”There’s a clear a sense of unfinished business when Mr McComb — a Carryduff native himself — talks about her. “Do I have regrets  Absolutely,” he said.“We worked really hard but this one just always seemed to elude us.“I do carry that one around as a bit of a burden.”Mr McComb told how he grew up playing with his brothers and friends in the area where the baby’s body was discovered on March .“The Duck Walk was a place that children of my age and generation instantly recognise,” he said.“How did someone know to go there  You’d need local knowledge. It was an unusual place to go.“Because I was from Carryduff, it began to feel that little bit more personal due to my connections to the village.”Before being disposed of at the Duck Walk, experts believe that Carrie had been buried in a garden or flowerbed.Weeks later, her body was subsequently removed and placed in a bin bag until she was later found by four young children.Brothers Raymond and Ryan Waddell, aged  and , had been playing along with Danielle Cltonand Rachel Mills , near the sports complex when they caught sight of something.According to The Detail website, closer inspection revealed it to be the umbilical cord — hanging out from a bin bag lying in undergrowth.One of the boys shook the plastic bag with his shoe.Initially, some of children thought it was a doll, although Danielle — who opened the bag — told the investigative website that she “knew straight away it was a baby”.When the Belfastcontacted Danielle, she would only say that it was “something I’m still dealing with  years on”.The inquest into Carrie’s death took place in February .A post-mortem examination ruled that the little girl had been born alive, weighing ,g , and she had “a good growth of darkish hair”.The autopsy report said her wounds were “consistent with having been made by a bladed weapon such as a kne” — seven on the scalp, one to the centre of her forehead, one on the right side of her chest, another on the outer side of the right hip, a stab wound on the left thigh and an incision just above the knee.Around cm of umbilical cord was still attached to her abdomen. Its free end was ragged and had not been tied.Coroner John Leckey determined her death “was due to a severe head injury caused either by blows to the head with a hard, blunt object or by the head having been struck against a hard surface”.He added that “there was evidence of multiple stab wounds”.The then state pathologist, Professor Jack Crane, said the nature of the stab wounds “indicates some degree of hesitation”.There was little doubt that Carrie had been born healthy.“The forensic and pathological examination showed that her lungs had expanded so she had breathed independently of mum,” said Mr McComb.“She was a perfect newborn, but shortly afterwards she was killed in a iety of ways.“She had  stab wounds, but none of them would have been fatal. The most serious had punctured her ribcage and had gone into one of her lungs — but it was not the cause of death.”Mr McComb has always thought “there was another pair of hands” involved.“I’ve never accused Carrie’s mum of killing her,” he said.“That’s because of the sequencing of when baby Carrie was born and murdered almost immediately.“Assuming she was born via a natural birth, would the mother have had the physical energy, let alone the mental acuity, to kill the baby “It pushes the theory towards another person.”When asked why Carrie was initially buried, Mr McComb said to understand that “you have to understand how she was conceived”.“We don’t know the circumstances,” he said.“Whether this was an unwanted child in its simplest terms or a child that was brought about because of sexual offending, a rape, or incest, a child born in circumstances that the family would be ashamed of “We simply don’t know. But there was something in the circumstances of her birth that said this child is not wanted and this child cannot live.”In the months after Carrie’s death, there were multiple appeals issued by the PSNI for the mother to come forward.The DNA of around , local women aged between  and  was tested and over , people were interviewed by officers.BBC’s Crimewatch programme highlighted the case and included an image of what Carrie might have looked like as an older baby.Detectives contacted GPs, maternity units, midwives, social services, community psychiatric nurses, hospitals and others including the Samaritans, Nexus, NSPCC and Brook Advisory Clinic.Enquiries were also conducted in the UK and the Republic.Mr McComb said he thought he was coming close to solving what happened “several times”.Between  and  women were directly approached and were ruled out being Carrie’s mother.“With the exception of the Inga Maria Hauser investigation, baby Carrie was the largest DNA screening we’d done,” he said.“We narrowed it down to residents in Carryduff aged between  and .“The vast majority of people were very supportive of this incredibly complex operation.”Despite the passage of years and the absence of answers, Mr McComb still believes this case will be solved.“Those are  years that the mother has missed,” he said.“There may be circumstances that the mother thinks she’s glad of that — because the child was born out of wedlock or rape or whatever that might be — but there’s still that really emotional bond to children in those circumstances.”A inter-denominational service for baby Carrie was held at a funeral parlour on Belfast’s Ravenhill Road on August .Church of Ireland clergyman Rev John Auchmuty said the little girl had suffered a terrible end to her all-too-short le.He declined our invitation to talk about it, but at the time he said: “Through no fault of baby Carrie’s, she was denied the right to le.”The children who found her body were also there to say their personal farewells and they walked behind the tiny white coffin carried from the service by detective sergeant Lindsay McNair, who was part of the police investigation team.She was buried at Knockbreda Cemetery.The inscription on the headstone reads: “Baby Carrie —known only to God.”Which isn’t strictly true at least one person knows who she is, and has continued to elude justice.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr McComb thinks it’s “absolutely possible” for something like this to happen again.“How many people spend their days face down on a phone, tablet or computer ” he said.“When we did house-to-house enquiries in ... people were already saying ‘I come into my house, I close the curtains, I don’t bother with anybody and I don’t know what’s going on outside my door’.“It’s more likely that that’s happening now because nobody is looking at their friends or neighbours they’re looking at their devices.”Now,  years on from what happened, he has a special message for the child’s mother.“All I would say to mum is that,you’re still there, this was still your daughter,” he said.“She will be your daughter until you pass on. History will always know that she was your daughter.“She lies in a grave with a name that we gave her, that may not be a name that you want her to have — so there’s still that opportunity for you to tell us your story.“There’s still time for you to claim back your daughter who may have been taken from you beyond your control... just to be able to do the honest, decent thing.“We never made a judgement on her circumstances, or on her guilt or innocence, we always said it was likely to be another pair of hands and I hold that to this day.“Mum still has the opportunity to say, ‘I want to claim my daughter’”.Little Carrie is at peace, but so many others clearly aren’t.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandPSNI launch fresh appeal on th anniversary of murder of ‘Baby Carrie’Man arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bailGreenvale Hotel tragedy: Young St Patrick’s Day disco victims are remembered three years on PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionPeter Tatchell is right, prosecuting Co Down anti-gay preacher will only aid his odious crusade PremiumClerical abuse at St Colman’s: ‘The fear was constant, never knowing when the next beating would be’Most ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyDown Royal: UTV’s Pamela Ballantine upsets the odds with her   winnerBelfast woman’s powerful picture of Donegal beach in colours of Ukraine goes viralMan arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bailRevealed: Northern Ireland heating oil costs per postcode fall in fortnight but still remain at high levelsTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandTaxi driver puts out fire after shop targeted by arsonistMake-up artist’s St Patrick’s Day leprechaun transformation clocks up millions of views on TikTok‘Revulsion’ over PO sackings as ministers review contracts with ferry firmGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandFormer Ulster Unionist MP’s firm handling communications for POLatestJohnson compares Ukraine’s fight for freedom to Brexit voteUK mother raising money to help people with autism fleeing Ukraine‘No credible off-ramp for Putin’, says Ross as he warns of long warLiz Truss: ‘Ludicrous debates’ about statutes and pronouns must endTaxi driver puts out fire after shop targeted by arsonist,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Other workers, mostly hospitality and already employed through agencies, remained on board.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThey have treated us all like c**p, says -year PO veteranMargaret Canning:OpinionPO Ferries: Operator of busy link with Scotland recorded £.m profit in , but other factors at play hereWhile PO was silent on Thursday night on why the services are suspended, it is believed the new crew needs to be trained up and may require the green light from maritime regulators to sail.Fears were growing among the approximately  to  Port of Larne ground staff employed directly by PO.East Antrim MLA John Stewart said they had heard nothing from the company as events unfolded quickly on Thursday, adding that the crew members were “treated despicably”.PO, owned by Dubai-headquartered conglomerate DP World since , said it had to take the action because the company was not “viable” after posting losses of £m in the last financial year.The sackings came two years after , staff were made redundant at the same time investors were paid a £m idend, which the company said it was legally obliged to disburse.“Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyBelfast woman’s powerful picture of Donegal beach in colours of Ukraine goes viralDown Royal: UTV’s Pamela Ballantine upsets the odds with her   winnerMan arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bailSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandTaxi driver puts out fire after shop targeted by arsonistMake-up artist’s St Patrick’s Day leprechaun transformation clocks up millions of views on TikTok‘Revulsion’ over PO sackings as ministers review contracts with ferry firmGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandFormer Ulster Unionist MP’s firm handling communications for POLatestMurder investigation launched after woman, , killed in student accommodationJohnson compares Ukraine’s fight for freedom to Brexit voteUK mother raising money to help people with autism fleeing Ukraine‘No credible off-ramp for Putin’, says Ross as he warns of long warLiz Truss: ‘Ludicrous debates’ about statutes and pronouns must end,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The issue of a single, agreed candidate can no longer be ignored. The unionist parties must once and for all put country before party.”The DUP’s Diane Dodds was the last unionist politician to occupy one of the five Assembly seats in the West Belfast constituency - some  years ago.Currently four Sinn Fein MLAs and People Before Profit’s Gerry Carroll represent the area, but the Greater Shankill Coalition believes its initiative willa unionist representativethe three unionist parties are on board, but it’s not known yet who they have in mind to stand for election.A well-placed source has told the Belfastthat they believed that while the DUP and TUV could be persuaded to stand aside, there had been no indication in that direction from the Ulster Unionists.The source told us: “This is not a pact and this is not a joint unionist candidate by any stretch of the imagination, this is almost like a community candidate coming forward that could command the widest amount of buy-in and support across the electorate.“Because let’s be clear, none of the unionist parties are going to take that seat and they all know it, so it will be an independent pro-Union single candidate who can command the widespread unionist support.” The TUV spokesman has said that they are “not minded to make any comment at this stage”.The UUP said: “Linsey Gibson was announced as the Ulster Unionist Party’s candidate for West Belfast at our Party Conference in October .That situation hasn’t changed and will not change. We therefore urge everyone to get behind this pro union candidate for West Belfast.”\"The DUP was also \"contacted for comment.Related topicsTraditional Unionist VoiceUlster Unionist PartyNorthern Ireland AssemblyMost ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyDown Royal: UTV’s Pamela Ballantine upsets the odds with her   winnerBelfast woman’s powerful picture of Donegal beach in colours of Ukraine goes viralMan arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bailRevealed: Northern Ireland heating oil costs per postcode fall in fortnight but still remain at high levelsTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan to run in Lagan Valley constituency in upcoming Assembly electionDUP deputy leader Paula Bradley stepping away from politics to care for elderly parentsDUP’s William Humphrey announces he will not contest upcoming Stormont electionDUP MLA George Robinson announces retirement after  years in StormontAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateLatestJohnson compares Ukraine’s fight for freedom to Brexit voteUK mother raising money to help people with autism fleeing Ukraine‘No credible off-ramp for Putin’, says Ross as he warns of long warLiz Truss: ‘Ludicrous debates’ about statutes and pronouns must endTaxi driver puts out fire after shop targeted by arsonist,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Boris Yeltsin’s hometown and the site of the executions of the Tsar Nikolai II and his family by the Bolsheviks in , it has hosted some key moments in Russian and Soviet history.I spent a couple of days there during the  World Cup, and ahead of the Peru France game, I spoke to Tanya from Sevastopol, who was working as a volunteer. Sevastopol is on the Crimean Peninsula, about ,km from Yekaterinburg which is located where Europe meets Asia.During our brief conversation, she declared that Crimea was most certainly not Ukraine, in case there was any doubt. I hadn’t asked, and anyway I’d heard it all before.Over  years ago, when I started studying Russian in Trinity College, one of my teachers ruefully recounted the story of how former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had given Ukraine the present of ‘Crimea’, which sits in Ukrainian territory on the Black Sea.Sure, what’s a peninsula with access to the Black Sea between friends when we’re all part of the Soviet Union Quite a lot when that Union breaks up.For those wonderingthe pronunciation and spelling of Kyiv are new inventions, that same teacher, whose lack of English gave our beginners’ Russian a run for its money, always referred to the city as ‘Keev’ and never pronounced it ‘Kee-yev’ as it was spelt in Russian.

The word ‘na’ is normally applied to general areas, for instance ‘the west’, ‘the north’ — and was never used for any other Soviet republic. The issue moved the newly-formed country to appeal to Russia in  to abandon this practice and only use the more logical “v Ukraine”. It didn’t work. Of course, in English, ‘The Ukraine’ was almost universal and, given how loaded ‘the north’ is when applied to Northern Ireland, it should not be a surprise that many English-speaking Ukrainians objected. It’s taken over  years of independence and a terrying war to finally get the penny — and the definite article — to drop in this part of the world.It was a dizzying era in eastern Europe — we took our Christmas holidays in December  as students of the USSR. When we ed the USSR no longer existed. The end of the Cold War opened up all kinds of possibilities, especially as we were required to spend months in Russia as part of our degree course.By the time I travelled over in , the loopholes which allowed previous foreign students to live comfortably had been locked shut and instead new rules were made that introduced higher prices for foreigners, regardless of income. Instead of living like Tsars, we had to work for a living.I hilariously found myself managing a western-owned Moscow courier company for a couple of months. The salary was basic, which matched my basic ability to manage my ‘team’ of couriers. The staff lived by the old Soviet mantra that they’d pretend to workwe pretended to pay them.In my defence, it’s not easy trying to manage any kind of delivery service in a strange metropolis where many street names had been changed from their communist-era titles.I was only ever stopped and asked for my papers once. ‘Dokumenty!’ hissed a poorly-dressed, obviously bored, conscript. A poorly-dressed student myself, his face dropped as he saw me lt the European passport out of my pocket. “I’m so, so sorry,” he said. “I thought you looked Ukrainian.”I never thought it betrayed any deep, underlying suspicion of the emerging state but was more likely just one desperate kid spotting a chance to get a few smokes off a scared foreigner. In a phonetic quirk, speaking Russian with an Irish accent was more likely to see you mistaken for a native of one of the Baltic republics.Ukrainian independence happened almost by accident and was only ever begrudgingly accepted in Moscow which always viewed it as within Russia’s ‘sphere of influence’. Even the Americans tended to agree.Russia without Ukraine was a very dferent country. After all, Khrushchev and his successor Leonid Brezhnev were Ukrainian, as were many of the USSR’s apparatchiki-in-chief. Catching out Ukrainians was not high on the priority list for law enforcement agencies of mid-s Moscow. Instead, you were more likely to see traders from the Caucasus, or what had been Soviet Central Asia stopped by police. Despite their Soviet passports, these ‘foreigners’ looked dferent and became easy targets — and not just for the police.Ukrainians don’t look dferent and, as you can hear from their president’s speeches, they don’t sound particularly dferent either.Russian troops will be coming up against people who in their minds look just like them, have very similar day-to-day lives and speak their language.Soldiers from Soviet Central Asia were used in sizable numbers when the Afghanistan invasion — or as Moscow called it, the ‘intervention’ — began in , but that policy changed swtly, in part due to fears the soldiers were fraternising with and getting too close to the enemy.For all the control Vladimir Putin has, the people speak openly, whether you’re a foreigner or not. You only have to open the door of a taxi and the driver will tell you everything that’s wrong with the world, especially Russia. I’d barely taken my seat on the way to Yekaterinburg airport when the Ford Fiesta driver launched into a tirade about how crazy it was that his city had managed to get to host games.He reeled off a whole host of reasons from the unpredictable weather, to the smog, the dirt and dozens of dferent sources of pollution in the area which made it about as unhealthy a place to stay, let alone play football.Not every city has a street called ‘Asbestos Lane’.While clearing out some old college junk recently, I came across a slip of paper with the name and address of a Russian who I shared accommodation with in Moscow in the late s.He swore rather than spoke Russian and had a Cockney accent after a stint in London with an Irish landlady.I’d forgotten his surname, so was delighted that I could make out his -year-old scrawl. I looked him up and got quite the shock to see him pictured on manoeuvres around Moscow as a high-ranking government official. I put off trying to track him down. Let’s face it, a western journalist contacting a Russian government official should probably go through certain channels, but I was still sure it could be done, some time.It looks like I’ll have to wait.Eoin Brannigan is editor-in-chief of Belfastand Sunday LeRelated topicsUkraineMost ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familyDown Royal: UTV’s Pamela Ballantine upsets the odds with her   winnerBelfast woman’s powerful picture of Donegal beach in colours of Ukraine goes viralMan arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bailRevealed: Northern Ireland heating oil costs per postcode fall in fortnight but still remain at high levelsTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest WorldFour US marines killed in Arctic Circle aircraft crashUkrainian journalist ‘kidnapped by Russian forces’Russia’s strategy of blockading Ukrainian cities will fail – ZelenskyRussia fires hypersonic missile for first time during Ukraine warFour US soldiers killed in plane crash during Nato exercise in NorwayLatestJohnson compares Ukraine’s fight for freedom to Brexit voteUK mother raising money to help people with autism fleeing Ukraine‘No credible off-ramp for Putin’, says Ross as he warns of long warLiz Truss: ‘Ludicrous debates’ about statutes and pronouns must endTaxi driver puts out fire after shop targeted by arsonist,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three.

Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks

intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the

every day. I havenrsquot taken a day off in ten weeks.Matthew revealed he has met Laurarsquos parents and that he was planning what he called ldquoa two-person trip once the show comes to an end.When askedhe ever expected to get to the quarter-final of the show, he said, \"Itrsquos amazing to get this far. I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways.

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives.

The Larne port route has been undermined by factors including the improved Holyhead journey to EnglandThe distress and anger at the dismissals are well covered in this newspaper.I want to write about another aspect of saga — the need for competition across the North Channel to Scotland, and the importance of the Larne-Cairnryan route.As someone who enjoys long distance driving, I have crossed by ferry numerous times from Northern Ireland or the Republic to Great Britain or even to France.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The are many dferent routes and many dferent vessels.The most luxurious is a Brittany Ferries boat, the Pont Aven, which travels between Cork and Roscoff. I have never been on a cruise but I imagine that it would be like that -hour crossing, on a liner with glorious restaurants .But one of the most important ferry services that has ever sailed from this island was operated by PO. It was the fast ferry between Larne and Cairnryan, which took one hour.It was, as far as I am aware, the fastest public boat service there has ever been between anywhere in Ireland and anywhere in Great Britain.The service was, of course, more expensive than the slower ferries and so demand for it waned after the financial crisis of  .The fast boat was scrapped. I wonderit will ever , or , like the way flights between London and New York got slower after the demise of Concorde, we will never see a similarly swt service.The route from Larne to Cairnryan is important for ious reasons.It is the shortest major sea-lane distance between Scotland and Northern Ireland.It now has, at the local end, a dual carriageway or motorway the whole distance from Larne to Belfast .And it brings boats into the middle of the eastern coast of Co Antrim, which is one of Ulster’s most populous counties.But the Larne route has been undermined by a number of factors including the Stena Line service from the northern outskirts of Belfast to Cairnryan, which is popular because it cuts out driving at the Northern Ireland end.Also by the radical improvement of the Belfast to London via Holyhead route.As recently as  years ago that journey was a tedious one by boat and car. Now there is not only a motorway from Belfast to Dublin, but it ends in a tunnel that brings you straight to Dublin port.At the far end there is a high quality dual carriageway all through Anglesey and on towards England.On the Scottish side of the North Channel, the A from Cairnryan and Stranraer to Dumfries and the English border is a twisting single carriageway that shows little sign of being upgraded in a signicant way in the coming decades.Taking a boat over to Scotland and driving on that road was once the obvious way to motor to England, but that journey now faces competition from more attractive options, notably the Holyhead route.It is also important that travellers benefit from the lower fares caused by competition across the North Channel.Stena Line have invested in a good service to ports including Cairnryan but boat services between Scotland and Northern Ireland have long seemed much more pricey than comparable car ferries in places such as Canada.If there was no competition, the situation would become even worse.When there was fierce debate about the merits of a bridge or tunnel between NI and GB, I wrote here about how a bridge was a nice dream, but a distant one. Much better in the meantime to reinstate the PO fast ferry and then upgrade the arduous A.Now the whole future and reputation of PO is in doubt, let alone any prospect of ato the fast ferry.We are all horried by the thought of losing our jobs in the sudden and ruthless way that the PO staff did.If it does not provide a good and well-run ferry service from the natural port of Larne to Loch Ryan, then let us hope some other provider does — and that passengers use it enough for the route to remain viable.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: A snapshot of fuel prices between Bangor, Belfast and Lisburn• Ben Lowry: A reader’s generous cash donation for Ukraine is given to Black Santa"},{"url":null,"title":"lord empey is right about the dup but the uup also has questions to answer ","story":"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan to stand for DUP in Lagan Valley Assembly election   Joe Biden tells St Patrick’s Day gathering: I may be Irish but I’m not stupidNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionLord Empey is right about the DUP but the UUP also has questions to answerA letter from Tom Ferguson:By The NewsroomSaturday, th March , : am  \"       \"  Letter to the editorI read Lord Empey’s reply Unionists will pay for DUP change to first minister rules,’ March , see link below to my letter  with interest.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSeven people injured following three-vehicle crash near Magh...NewsRoad closed: motorists asked to avoid Moneysharvin Road, Mag...NewsEmergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough N...NewsAntrim and Newtownabbey Council names leisure centres likely...NewsPSNI appeal after Larne driver’s car windscreen cracked in s...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaadccdbcfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cddebecabefdbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
