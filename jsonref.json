TAMING THE MOPBoris famously would deliberately muss up his hair before stepping in front of the cameras, so it’s been something of a sacrifice to adopt a neater coiffure.Where he once forked out no more than £15 at a Turkish barber shop near his old Islington home for a cut — with a head massage, shave and a beer thrown in — his hair is now properly styled, says grooming expert Lucas Armitage. ‘It looks like he’s spending in the region of £60.’‘The hair is one of the first things a person usually alters to signal a “change”,’ adds Lucas.’One insider told the Mail: ‘It’s been cut shorter not only because it’s smarter but also because it’s thinning, which is a shame for Boris because it’s one of his greatest assets. He was reluctant, but Carrie was insistent. It’s a sign of her sway over him. It’s a bit like Meghan and Harry. What Carrie wants, Carrie gets.’BANNING THE BINGESAs a bon viveur, Boris used to indulge in ‘late night binges of chorizo and cheese’.Breakfast would sometimes be ‘cold spaghetti or a chop or two, if there is some left over from my kids’ meal the night before’.In 2008, he memorably lambasted the UN for urging people to cut down on meat to help the environment.‘If they seriously believe I’m going to give up meat in the hope of reducing the temperature of the planet, they must be totally barmy,’ he railed.Carrie, however, is a passionate environmentalist who campaigns on animal rights, and is said to have supported Brexit because it would mean a possible end to live animal exports.So it’s unlikely to be a coincidence Boris is said to have become ‘pretty much vegetarian’ recently. A friend says: ‘Carrie has shown him that a healthy diet means he has more energy and more focus. He has been struck dumb by the improvement. He isn’t as tired or grumpy and gets much more done.’He’s even experimented with veganism after ‘Carrie has told him that methane gas from cows breaking wind is bad for the environment and going vegan would be good for him’. However, he lasted just three days, as he couldn’t bear life without cheese.         Carrie Symonds leaves Boris Johnson\u0027s Conservative party leadership campaign in central LondonHALF THE MAN HE USED TO BEBoris has admitted he always took pride in his ‘Hulk-like strength and the blast furnace super bellows of my lung capacity’ — but last year a doctor warned him he was tipping the scales at 16.5 stone.As he’s around 5ft 9in tall, this gave him a BMI of 35.9 — officially obese according to NHS guidelines. Within two weeks of cutting down on meat, eggs and diary, he’d lost 12lb and is continuing to shed the pounds under the watchful eye of Carrie.CUTTING BACK ON BOOZEBoris has always been open about his love of alcohol. ‘I do drink quite a lot of wine and champagne, at least a bottle a day,’ he wrote in 2005. ‘It doesn’t matter if it’s expensive or not because all wine is good.’However, friends say the new Boris now recognises that he gets more done when he’s sober.‘He used to be the sort who could easily down a bottle of wine by himself at dinner after a drink at the bar. But after giving up for three months completely, he no longer “does a bottle” and just sticks to a single glass,’ says one.Several of his advisers have given up, too, yet another a sign of how serious they are about his leadership campaign.Boris’s complexion has also vastly improved as a result, according to grooming expert Lucas Armitage: ‘His skin looks smoother and less ruddy. He may have had some light dermabrasion treatment as his forehead looks a lot less lined if you look at his before and after pictures.’PUMPING IRON, NOT POUNDING PAVEMENTSBoris has long been a keen runner with a taste for eccentric jogging outfits, including Hawaiian beach shorts and a bobble hat. He was also a keen cyclist, but while Foreign Secretary he was apparently banned from cycling over fears he was a key target for terrorists.Now with his lover’s full encouragement, Boris is back on his bike . . . and more.A friend says: ‘It’s true that we have not seen Boris running as he did, probably because it wasn’t really working for him.’Instead, Boris is said to be working out at his London home with Carrie, using weights under the possible guidance of a trainer.His hard work has paid off and he is able to fit into more flattering suits. Stylish and well cut, a source says Carrie has ‘personally kitted him out’ to her impeccable taste."},{"url":null,"title":"Post Office workers set bumper pay rise","story":"Share this article The Post Office has pledged to bring forward an increase in the fees paid to postmasters for offering customers banking from January 2020 to October this year.

In it, she reads from her essay Portrait of Diego, which was taken from the catalogue of a 1949 exhibition at the Palace of Fine Arts, celebrating 50 years of Rivera’s work.“He is a gigantic, immense child, with a friendly face and a sad gaze,” she says, as translated by Agence France-Presse. (A different English translation of the text can be found on Google Arts \u0026amp Culture.)“His high, dark, extremely intelligent and big eyes rarely hold still. They almost come out of their sockets because of their swollen and protuberant eyelids – like a toad’s. They allow his gaze to take in a much wider visual field, as if they were built especially for a painter of large spaces and crowds.”It is estimated that the recording was made in 1953 or 1954.In the press release, Mexico’s secretary of culture, Alejandra Frausto, said if it is indeed Kahlo’s voice – a claim which authorities continue to investigate – it could be the only audio recording of the artist that exists.The library’s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country’s most important historical figures – but library national director Pável Granados said Kahlo’s voice was the “most requested and sought-after” by visitors.“Frida’s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search,” Granados told a press conference. “Until now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo.”The radio show the recording was taken from, El Bachiller, was named for its host Álvaro Gálvez y Fuentes “El Bachiller”, who has been described by the ministry of culture as “the main documentalist of the voices of his time”.The sound library has 1,300 El Bachiller tapes among its collection, which will need to be digitised and cataloged in order to ascertain if more of Kahlo’s voice is among them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728f0d7e1204ff5e02d4750bf15ee50980f15923/0_20_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6523cf2101af8cb0122ad94a81024814","title":"native american female artists minneapolis institute of art","story":"In a groundbreaking new exhibition, the often unseen or uncredited works of Native American women are being celebratedWalk into most museums and there might be something missing on the wall labels beside Native American artworks – an Apache dress from the 19th century might just read: “Title, year, materials.”What’s missing? The artist’s name. Though many of the artists’ names were not recorded, and will forever be anonymous, many that have been recorded are now being recognized as never before.Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists is the first ever museum retrospective of Native American and Canadian female artists. It opened at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and until 18 August, over 115 artists from 50 native communities are being given the credit they deserve.“This is the first, believe it or not, show devoted to Native women artists,” said Jill Ahlberg Yohe, who co-curated the exhibit with Teri Greeves. “It’s the first to honor Native women from ancient times to the contemporary moment.”Then why did it take so long?Most 19th century art collectors were “men with a Victorian sensibility,” Yohe said. For the most part, these men weren’t interested “in identifying women, or inidualizing Native people”.Yohe has been working on this exhibition since 2015. “It dawned on me after scouring the collections that all the work is made by women,” she said.Putting together the show meant more than just plucking out items from renowned collections. Rather than repeating the same old narratives, the co-curators wanted to incorporate fresh voices.That led them to working with 21 women, both native and non-native scholars and artists, to curate this show as part of their “exhibition advisory board”. “That’s what made it special,” said Yohe. “We have the voices, expertise and knowledge from all these women.”Upon entering the exhibition, there’s a parked 1985 Chevy El Camino by Rose Simpson, a work which pays homage to 19th-century potter Maria Martinez, “the first self-identified non anonymous native artist,” said Yohe. That sets the tone for the entire show, which is ided into three sections: legacy, relationships and power.The exhibition includes the work of 12 Canadian artists to trace tribes and communities that were established long before borders between the two countries. “The borders between the US and Canada weren’t created by indigenous people, but by outside influences,” said Yohe. “All this work is connected to our history, whether it was made in 1500 or 2019. It’s all a part of the American and Canadian story.”Métis artist Christi Belcourt shows The Wisdom of the Universe, a tapestry from 2014 that features animals on the endangered species list in Canada, alongside Haida fashion designer Dorothy Grant, who sketches Haida artwork onto clothing, is showing her wool Hummingbird Dress from 1989, the same year she debuted her first collection.Though craft and fashion play a role in this exhibit, it’s not where it ends. “It’s the gendered aspect of women’s work,” said Yohe. “These categories don’t work they just don’t work in native communities.”One of the most fun pieces in the exhibit is a pair of heels by LuiseñoShoshone-Bannock artist Jamie Okuma, who is showing her Adaption II shoes from 2012. The artist has taken a pair of Christian Louboutin heels and covered them in what Yohe calls “Native couture” – including the likes of glass beads, porcupine quills and buckskin. The work counteracts the stereotype that Native art lives in the past and lacks sophistication.Creek-Cherokee artist Joan Hill is showing her 1990 painting Women’s Voices at the Council, which shows the head of a tribe, a woman she refers to as the “Beloved Woman”, meeting with other women as part of the decision-making for their tribe.Haida artist Freda Diesing shows Mask, Old Woman with Labret from 1974, which depicts a woman with a labret, a body modification known as “lip plugs”, which were recognized as status symbols for women on the north-west coast. (Diesing was one of the few women carvers of her generation and her Haida name Skil Kew Wat means “magical little woman”).The artworks here are more than just decorative or folk-art masterpieces. They offer an overlooked, often silenced narrative. “Their work tells the story of native people, the idea of resilience, despite all measures of annihilation of federal policy, settlers and acts of genocide,” said Yohe.Anishinaabe artist Rebecca Belmore shows Fringe, a sculpture from 2007, which draws attention to the violence against First Nations women with a gaping back scar the artist believes will never disappear. But this exhibition is, in part, about healing.For one, it aims to be a counter-narrative. They’re calling it “corrective art history” to the dusty old textbooks that ignored them for decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1125f8ed90873b20993a6ccdaaf274819ed718/0_392_4846_2907/master/4846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c77bb9d0a65c6ee0791448bdf2f8935","title":"revolution latin american photography in pictures","story":"From the photos by Alberto Korda that helped canonise Che Guevara to snatched street images of resistance, new show Urban Impulses embraces a turbulent half-century of revolvers and rebellion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc069302c2b2414fceb112546d0a79e95d18a43/1154_1326_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76611af386ca7a9cd858e26047186ba9","title":"observer new review summer book clinic send us your questions","story":"Heading on holiday but no idea what to read?

It is derived from the peyote cactus and other members of the cactus family, was first synthesised in the laboratory in the early 20th century, and was made famous by Aldous Huxley’s thoughtful account of his experimentation with the drug in The Doors of Perception (1954) and Hunter S Thompson’s completely frenzied account of his experiences on “the fiendish cactus juice” in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971).Mike Jay is an eminent writer on mind-stilling and mind-expanding substances, having written numerous books, including what is by far the best study of laughing gas (The Atmosphere of Heaven), and just about the only book on the ancient ritual drink soma (The Blue Tide). Mescaline reads like the culmination of a lifetime’s wanderings in the very farthest outposts of scientific and medical history. It roams from speculation about the use of psychedelic snuff in the prehistoric Chavín culture of the northern Andes, to descriptions of the pre-conquest peyote rituals of the Nahua in Mexico and Comanche chief Quanah Parker’s promotion of the peyote religion, to a detailed account and analysis of Walter Benjamin’s drug habit, the CIA’s covert MK-Ultra drug-testing programme, and the recent popularity of ayahuasca ceremonies. Who knew that Frederick Madison Smith, grandson of Joseph Smith and the third Mormon prophet-president, was a peyote enthusiast?Despite its breadth – because of its breadth – Jay’s is a highly nuanced account. His aim is to study the uses and effects of mescaline in its many and erse historical and cultural contexts. Western modernity, he notes, has often focused on the nature of mescaline visions, ascribing them meanings variously “neurological, literary, occult, psychodynamic, aesthetic, spiritual”, while indigenous cultures have tended to regard the visions as of merely peripheral interest, compared to the life-enhancing importance of rituals and ceremonies. “The distinction,” he notes, “between western and indigenous understandings of mescaline maps closely, though not exactly, on to the distinction between pure mescaline, the product of the 20th-century laboratory, and its natural sources: two families of cactus, the peyote of Mexico and the San Pedro of the Andes.”The book is by no means a user’s guide, but Jay clearly has some personal interest in the subject. “My uncle Peter … after reading The Doors of Perception … visited the office of Aldrich, the research chemical supplier, outside London and casually requested some … He was sold half a kilo, over a thousand doses, which kept the beatnik vanguard of Soho and the Sussex coasts supplied for some time.” The book ends with the author’s account of his own participation in an elaborate and mystical peyote ceremony, though his account of an earlier rough-and-ready experiment with some boiled cactus and cane sugar is perhaps rather more revealing, as well as off-putting: “Languorous muscle relaxation combined with tremors, restlessness and nausea fizzing euphoria with the ominous sensation of a fast-rising fever a thrumming vibration in the chest with a cold heaviness in the limbs.” The warm glow from a swift half after work or a stiff G\u0026ampT this is not.Undoubtedly the most famous description of the effects of taking mescaline is from The Doors of Perception, in which Huxley describes “Those folds in the trousers – what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of the grey flannel – how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous!” Jay notes that Huxley had in fact been wearing jeans during the actual experiment and that it was only his wife Maria’s insistence that he should be rather “better dressed” for his readers that turned Huxley’s blue jeans into grey flannel.

About a fifth of people using the scheme already own property, while more than 8,000 people who benefited from it had household incomes of more than £100,000, the NAO said.The scheme has proven controversial as housebuilders’ profits have dramatically increased since the introduction of the scheme, benefiting company bosses and shareholders.More than £2.3bn in idends was paid out by the nine biggest firms in their most recent financial year, while the housebuilder Persimmon – half of whose sales were through help to buy – offered its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, a bonus worth £110m. He was asked to leave amid public fury last year after the bonus was scaled back to £75m.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “Help to buy has increased home ownership and housing supply, particularly for first-time buyers. However, a proportion of participants could have afforded to buy a home without the government’s help.”He said it was not yet possible to assess whether the scheme had delivered value for money for taxpayers because the NAO needed to observe the longer-term effects on the property market. However, he warned that the government faced a challenge to wean the property market off the scheme with as little impact as possible on its plan to build 300,000 homes a year from the mid 2020s.By 2023, the amount loaned under help to buy is expected to reach as much as £25bn, while the government forecasts it will recover its investment by 2031-32 before making profits thereafter as people repay their loans.Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, said: “Help to buy has been genuinely life changing for first-time buyers across the country, helping them secure their first step on the property ladder.He said that from 2021 the scheme would be extended and strengthened to make it exclusively for first-time buyers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf4d14edd919133aadb25881f2201dfb72d44be/0_11_4203_2522/master/4203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ae0df38c3fd936f508b1ad8411486b","title":"carlos ghosns former home inside tokyos notorious detention centre","story":"Short tour allowed inside Japanese prison accused of keeping suspects in conditions designed to ‘break’ them for confessions The forbidding outline of Tokyo detention centre is impossible to miss, even on a dark, wet afternoon in early June. The X-shaped building dominates the skyline of the unfashionable Kosuge neighbourhood in the city’s north-east.Aside from brief eruptions of media interest when a high-profile killer is led to the gallows, for much of the time there is little public scrutiny of its occupants – more than 1,600 inmates and about 800 staff.But in recent months, it has attracted unprecedented public attention thanks to one man: Carlos Ghosn.The former Nissan chair spent 108 days here for questioning over charges of financial misconduct and breach of trust, before being released on bail in March. He was re-arrested shortly after and spent another 21 days in Kosuge before being released on bail again in late April.His lengthy incarceration sparked international condemnation of Japan’s “hostage justice”, which allows prosecutors to hold suspects up to 23 days for each potential charge and question them without their lawyers present.But there was criticism, too, of the conditions that men, and a much smaller number of women, who like Ghosn have not been found guilty of a crime, must endure while they wait for the leaden wheels of Japan’s criminal justice system to creak into motion.Apparently stung by the negative publicity, this week the centre opened its doors to foreign journalists in an attempt to address criticism that it is part of a system that regards suspects as guilty until proven innocent.At first, Ghosn was kept in a 7.5 sq metre cell containing fold-up bedding, a toilet, a bookshelf, a low table and a sink, but he was later transferred to a larger cell with a bed, according to media reports at the time.Inmates are permitted to exercise in fenced yards for 30 minutes a day and take a two-hour nap after lunch.But for the remainder of their waking hours inside their cell, they are required to sit on the floor. The rule is designed to avoid confusing guards who, seeing a prone inmate, may incorrectly think he has fallen ill or committed suicide, according to the centre’s chief warden, Shigeru Takenaka.“The three big risks in Japanese prisons are fires, escapes and suicides,” said Takenaka. To prevent inmates from hanging themselves, items in the cells have rounded corners and the sink is operated with buttons. “Everything is designed to prevent suicide attempts.”The cells, some of which can accommodate up to six people, do not have TVs. Inmates are allowed to listen to the daytime radio news, but not until the evening. They bathe three times a week in the summer and twice in the winter. Their day begins at 7am and ends when their cell lights are dimmed, but not switched off, at 9pm.Their three daily meals of rice, soup and a small portion of meat or fish – a diet that Ghosn reportedly struggled with – are decided by nutritionists. They can write one letter a day and receive unlimited correspondence from friends and family.The tour itinerary did not include the execution chamber, where death row inmates are hanged after a brief meeting with a Buddhist priest.A year ago, one of the centre’s most infamous inmates, the doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara, was hanged here over his role in the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands fell ill.Japan has drawn criticism for the secretive nature of its death penalty, with inmates kept in solitary confinement for years and given only several hours’ notice of their executions – a practice Amnesty International condemned as “cruel, inhuman and degrading”.Takenaka declined to comment on capital punishment, and rejected criticism that suspects awaiting trial are kept in conditions more appropriate for convicted prisoners.“In terms of living conditions, I think we meet all of the proper standards – in nutrition, exercise and medical care,” he said. He declined to comment on claims, made by Ghosn’s lawyers among others, that the facility’s austere conditions were designed to “break” suspects and enable prosecutors to extract confessions.In April, Ghosn’s defence team said his second period in detention had interrupted his treatment for a chronic kidney ailment and that prosecutors were attempting to force a confession out of him during interrogations that lasted up to 14 hours a day, sometimes in the middle of the night.From the bulletproof cell windows to medical facilities that include a CT scanner and doctors working round the clock, Takenaka insisted the centre’s purpose was to enable inmates to prepare for their trials in safety.Violence between inmates was practically unheard of, he said: “They don’t have to defend themselves as they do in the west. They are protected here.“They will ultimately return to society, so we have to strike a balance. Living conditions here have to be good, but not so good that they are better than those of some people living outside.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

In 2019, in a liberal democracy such as Japan, could the issue of women’s rights still be stuck on stilettos?But the global spotlight on the hashtag #kutoo (a pun on a word for shoes and a word for pain) may have obscured what’s really happening in Japan. “It’s so trivial,” said one senior female publishing executive, who wished to remain anonymous. After all, on the streets of Tokyo, there is a growing movement for real change for women, not merely more comfortable footwear.“We are so surprised that overseas media paid so much attention to the high-heel issue,” said a member of abuse survivor organisation Spring. “There is a much more serious and deeper issue: Japan’s sex-crime issue.”On Tuesday night, bearing placards reading “Say no to sex crimes” and “Judges need human rights education”, hundreds of women and men gathered near the Imperial Palace. The “flower demonstration” is a peaceful monthly protest against sexual violence, sparked by a string of recent acquittals in sexual assault cases.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownOne of the highest-profile women to attend was Mizuho Fukushima, a member of the House of Councillors and former chair of the Social Democratic party. “More attention needs to be on the offenders, while victims shouldn’t be judged,” she told the  at the protest.It is a big progressive step for a country that remains mired in deep-seated conservatism when it comes to gender roles. Japan remains a shocking 110th in the world for gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum. At the recent abdication of Emperor Akihito, women were not even allowed into the ceremony room, let alone are they eligible as heirs to the Chrysanthemum throne. Last year nine medical schools admitted rigging entrance exams to exclude female applicants. In the world of sumo an outcry erupted after female medics, who had rushed to the aid of a stroke victim, were ordered away from the ring, a male-only space.But if Japanese women have often been stereotypically portrayed as submissive and weak, this idea of passivity may be dissipating at the start of the new Reiwa Era. The flower demonstration is the highest-profile example, and was set off by an unusually cruel court verdict. The case involved a father who was accused of repeatedly raping his 19-year-old daughter. The court accepted that he continued to have non-consensual sex with his daughter – but said it could not prove that she resisted, and acquitted him.Similar protests have been held in nine cities across the country, and more than 40,000 women have signed petitions demanding justice. Many sexual assault survivors have started to speak out about their experiences, including Jun Yamamoto, head of Spring.“We hope to create a society where victims will be warmly and emphatically told, ‘We believe you. It’s not your fault,’ and be strongly supported,” Yamamoto said. “To that end, a victim-centred approach must take root in Japan.”Yamamoto is a leading lobbyist for a change in the sexual assault law, which the government rewrote in 2017 for the first time in over a century. The new law included forced anal and oral sex in the definition of rape, raised the minimum sentence for rape to five years from three, and made prosecution possible even if victims do not press charges. But there is lots more to be done, she said, including greater support for victims.Another target is institutional discrimination. Last week, 36 women filed suit with the Tokyo District Court against Tokyo Medical University, seeking a combined 143 million yen in damages. The school is one of nine that admitted rigging entrance exams to systematically exclude female applicants, favouring less qualified men. After it was exposed, some people defended the policy with the rationale that because some women would leave the profession to have children, more male doctors would stave off a future labour shortage. The scandal prompted a government investigation, and plaintiffs hope the suits will discourage similar gender discrimination in future.Meanwhile, even something as apparently straightforward as being allowed to wear whatever shoes you like continues to prove tricky. In response to the #kutoo petition, Japan’s minister of labour, Takumi Nemoto, told parliament that requiring high heels in the workplace was perfectly acceptable – sparking further outrage at the government of Shinzo Abe, whose “Womenomics” policy is supposedly attempting to bring more women into the workforce.“‘Womenomics’ is BS,” says the publishing executive. “They need to work on raising the level of women first. But it’s so hard to speak out publicly. In private we complain to each other, but in public the atmosphere is so difficult: men control everything. It’s so deeply rooted. There are almost no women in power, so of course you think: is it only because of my ability that I don’t advance? Or is it something else?”Many such challenges remain at the highest levels of politics. The former Olympics minister, Yoshitaka Sakurada, recently urged all Japanese women to have “at least three children,” prompting women on social media to point out that blaming women wouldn’t solve Japan’s record-low birthrate.And despite Abe’s policies, only 1 in 10 politicians in the lower house of parliament is female, while only one member of the 20-member Cabinet is a woman, an actual decline from the beginning of his tenure.Etsuko Kato, professor of cultural anthropology and gender studies at International Christian University in Tokyo, says a fundamental change in attitude is needed to create a female-friendly working environment.“We need to change the sense of values – a good work ethic doesn’t mean long hours or even going to an office, if you start to think a talented worker is someone who can manage more work in less time,” she said. “Also, if you’re good, you are able to choose when and where you work, so this kind of attitude could change the system more effectively. With the development of the internet, it is possible to change such an attitude in many industries.”There has been some movement in business. Traditionally male professions, such as sushi restaurants, have been a challenging field for women to break into. Some traditionalists say women’s hands are too warm to keep the fish fresh, while others say long hours are a barrier.Hiroshi Abe, of Abe Sushi, which has seven restaurants across the city, is the rare restaurant owner who don’t care about the gender of his staff, and has actively recruited women chefs.“There is a great chance both for women and men chefs, as the industry has been growing,” he said. “Female chefs are appreciated, as they take care of some details that male chefs don’t notice.”There is also the persistent argument that Japanese women remain influential in areas of the domestic economy. Traditionally, they dominate household spending and childcare, with husbands bringing home pay and wives managing savings and spending, including a monthly allowance for the man. Even today, seven out of 10 households operate in this way, according to the Ouccino Research Institute.That model looks increasingly old-fashioned, however. Kato says the gender gap has consistently narrowed for the past 30 years, a trend hastened by the discrediting of Japan’s male-dominated industrial model through years of economic malaise.“There are young women in their 20s and early 30s who want differently,” confirms the publisher.Nevertheless, Kato argues that more attention must be paid to men’s attitudes: no matter how loudly Japanese women speak out, nothing will change unless male attitudes do, too.“To create a truly more equal society,” she says, “we need to wait for conservative Japanese men over 50 to retire.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

What really matters is actionTheresa May is doing her best to grab some good headlines in the closing weeks of her premiership. Setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital, but her government’s plans are too little too late.Yes, Britain may be the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, but others have shown greater ambition. Finland committed to be carbon-neutral by 2035, Norway has a 2030 target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net-zero by 2050 and dedicate a quarter of the EU’s next budget to projects fighting climate change. Britain wasn’t among them.What really matters is action, not words. For all her claims of leadership on climate, May’s record in office has been pitiful: support for fracking (against the wishes of local communities), blocking onshore wind (the cheapest renewable energy source) and displaying unlimited enthusiasm for new roads and runways.As a result, it’s not surprising that the government’s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has repeatedly warned that the UK is not on track to meet its near-term carbon targets in the 2020s and 2030s.Legislation will only deliver what’s intended if it is watertight, and this law falls well short. For example, there was no mention of aviation or shipping in the government’s announcement, and it’s not clear if they will be included. Yet aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of UK emissions, doubling since 1990.Moreover, there is a very clear “get-out” clause after five years, giving the UK the option of abandoning the target if other countries are not taking similarly ambitious action. The justification for this is that UK industries would face unfair competition if others continued with their carbon emissions.This is wrong on two counts. It undermines business certainty, which will affect long-term investment decisions. And it fails to give the spur to the UK’s low-carbon sector. The CBI has already said some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies. This law doesn’t provide them.Using international credits allows Britain to carry on emitting greenhouse gases while offsetting those emissions by planting trees in other countries or helping pay for low-carbon energy projects. These things need to happen but they should not be instead of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, they should be in addition.The UK cannot claim credit by grabbing the low-hanging fruit of easy wins in the global south, particularly when it slows the rate of decarbonisation in Britain. If we are really serious about net-zero emissions, they must not be achieved with dodgy loopholes and cynical greenwash.I am also left with the suspicion that, for all the declarations of a climate emergency, the government’s approach is still incremental, based on making green-tinged tweaks to business as usual, in the vain hope that we will somehow creep towards our target of net-zero.We won’t. A carbon-free economy must deliver climate justice, focus on deindustrialised communities, provide good quality jobs for workers up and down the country, and support the global south. This law may give us the destination. What really matters is how, and how quickly, we get there.• Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d85739e0f4e62ff4eab5064ade28ad9883b7a34/0_0_1967_1181/master/1967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa03919f7dfccb83392a945c33d59bd","title":"binge tv sugar rush unsatisfying","story":"Yet how satisfying is binge-watching really? Yes, there’s something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away, but it’s also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want (at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up) is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV – and not necessarily for the better.Take, for example, the conversation around spoilers. It’s no coincidence that this has only intensified in the era of binge TV, when people no longer have any clear idea of when they can start discussing a major twist. Worse, binge-watching encourages us to put our inidual viewing experience centre stage, positioning it as equal to, if not more important than, the programme being watched. This means that we’re enraged when someone quicker off the mark discusses a show before we’re ready, leading to bitter arguments that would have been avoided if everyone was watching at the same time.And it’s not just spoiler etiquette that’s affected. The worst thing about binge-watching isn’t the online fury or the fear of missing out or even the sneaky lying to your family about how many episodes you’ve really watched. It’s that it denies viewers the pleasure that a truly communal TV experience brings.That sense of television as a communal rather than an inidual experience is the reason why the year’s most talked about shows – Game of Thrones, Line of Duty and Fleabag – have been those that aired weekly, forcing audiences to wait. Being made to wait seven days for each new episode of Game of Thrones is the reason why even the smallest plot points were analysed and debated and why viewers became so creative with memes and gifs.Similarly, if Line of Duty had been binge-watched, no one would have had time to concoct elaborate theories about OCGs and UCOs, while watching Fleabag back-to-back would have entirely lessened the cultural impact of the Hot Priest, a man whose appeal (or lack thereof) was driven by the fact that fans were feverishly discussing it every week.Of course a version of those conversations might still have happened if those shows had been available to watch all at once but they wouldn’t have dominated popular discourse in quite the same way.Not convinced? Then consider the example of The Last Kingdom. When it aired weekly on BBC Two, the travails of Uhtred, son of Uhtred were readily available to chew over in bite-sized chunks. The excellent third series has been on Netflix since last November but any discussion was over almost before it had truly begun. Similarly, Deutschland 83 was one of Channel 4’s biggest hits when it aired weekly. Deutschland 86, the sequel, barely caused a ripple after being released in its entirety on Walter Presents via All 4 earlier this year.The very nature of binge-watching means that the conversation becomes fragmented and, while it’s wonderful to find your tribe, those people who are obsessing over Call My Agent or the select (but clearly correct) few who have tracked down the second series of Harlots, it’s hard to top the rush of knowing we’re all watching the same thing at (roughly) the same point in time.At this point, committed bingers are no doubt shaking their heads in despair at my old-fashioned and out-of-touch ways. I understand. Truly, I do. It’s nice to have the power and the freedom to watch something at your own speed, to finish something when and as you want. But it’s nice too to have the space to think about what you’ve watched, to mull over what just happened while waiting for the next episode to air and to feel part of a wider moment (even if your biggest contribution is to say “why on earth is everyone watching this crap?”).At its best, television has always been a two-way conversation between creators and viewers, stuffed full of tasty morsels to discuss. The trouble with binge-watching is that it turns that over-stuffed banquet into a superficially filling but ultimately unsatisfying meal for one.• Sarah Hughes writes on TV and the arts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b3efba4cd6602361c073c6d68836aaa3b1b882c/0_110_4472_2683/master/4472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7025436ff8bc3b43e2fc65cabda46003","title":"uswnt thailand 13 0 world cup women can never win","story":" It’s crucial women call out double standards, but it’s also important we don’t cry ‘sexism’ to absolve ourselves of bad behavior Should America be ashamed of itself?I know that’s an evergreen question (and the answer is normally yes), but in this particular instance I’m talking about the US women’s soccer team (USWNT) thrashing Thailand 13-0 in the World Cup on Tuesday. Despite being a record-breaking performance, the exuberance with which USA celebrated goal after goal after goal has prompted criticism and accusations of unsporting behavior.A lot of this criticism, it should be said, came from male sports commentators. “The goal celebrations at 9-0, 10-0, 11-0 are so overboard. Why are they even trying to score any more? I’m on team Thailand at this point,” said Jeff Paterson, a Canadian sports reporter.“0.0 problem with the scoreline as this is the tournament, but celebrating goals (like No 9) leaves a sour taste in my mouth,” Taylor Twellman, an ESPN analyst and former player for the US men’s national team, said on Twitter.And commentator Max Bretos similarly tweeted: “I would tone down the celebration on the ninth goal, but that’s just me.”I understand Wambach’s frustration I’m sure every woman does. It doesn’t matter whether you’re on a soccer pitch or in a boardroom – being a woman means constantly battling impossible double standards. If you’re too friendly you’re considered unprofessional if you’re not friendly enough you’re considered a bitch. If you speak up, you’re told you’re too aggressive or emotional if you don’t speak up you’re told you’re not assertive enough. You can basically never win when you’re a woman, even when you win 13-0.Professional sport is particularly rife with double standards female players are rarely given the same levels of respect as their male peers. They’re certainly not given the same levels of compensation. The USWNT is currently in the middle of a federal lawsuit against US Soccer, alleging “institutional gender discrimination”. US Soccer’s response to this lawsuit has essentially been to claim that the women’s team – three-time World Cup winners – isn’t entitled to equal pay with the men’s team because they’re not performing equal work. This is beyond patronizing.Did sexism play a part in the criticism leveled against the US performance on Tuesday? Absolutely. Does that mean that none of the criticism is valid? Absolutely not. While Wambach is right to point out double standards, she is wrong to boil everything down to sexism. You don’t have to be wearing “patriarchal glasses” to think that USA could have behaved a lot more decently on Tuesday. I’m not saying they should have taken it easy on Thailand or scored fewer goals – but there was no need to be quite so over-the-top in their celebration, especially when they were playing a team that was clearly the underdog. The exuberance wouldn’t have been an issue if USA had thrashed France 13-0, but this wasn’t a fair fight. The celebration felt unnecessary and cruel.Plenty of female athletes have pointed this out, including Hope Solo, the team’s former goalkeeper, who acknowledged in the  that “some of the celebrations were a little overboard”. Clare Rustead, a Canadian soccer analyst and former player, was more blunt, calling the performance “disgraceful” and tweeting: “The USWNT displayed poor sportsmanship excessively celebrating many of the 13 goals against a 34th-ranked team. It has nothing to do with the final score. You are one of the best teams in the world. Act like it. And yeah, I definitely would have said the same about a men’s team.”It’s important that we call out double standards, but it’s also important that women don’t cry “sexism” to absolve ourselves of bad behavior. The USWNT’s behavior on Tuesday was objectively disappointing they could and should have performed a lot better. But with all that said, I would like to reiterate that it’s a brilliant team full of inspiring women, and I’m rooting for them all the way. (Unless they play England, in which case I’m hoping they get thrashed 13-0.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db883d7fc9241e953c6941856f1d06ef","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game. By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a tape-ball cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your nets giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats, and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life.

In the 30 years since, he’s inspired generations of young cricketersWhen Farouk Hussain first played cricket at the age of six he could only keep one eye on the game – he used the other one to watch out for trouble.Hussain and his friends would walk to a nearby factory, chalk a wicket on to its big wall, and play street cricket with a tennis ball.They had such fun, but the neighbours weren’t so keen. “We’d play for a few minutes, but then someone would come out to complain, so we’d have to leg it and wait for them to go back into their house,” he says.“We had to have one eye on the game and one eye on the doors of the local houses, so we could get away when they came out with their dogs. Quite frankly, we were petrified of those dogs.”However, during these sessions a seed was planted – and, ever since, the self-confessed “cricket anorak” has kept both eyes fixed on the sport.The 49-year-old was named 2018 Street Coach of the Year at the Chance to Shine awards ceremony at Lord’s cricket ground. It capped an inspiring journey for the man whose passion for the sport began with those impromptu games of street cricket, and who wants to ensure more children get involved in the game.The backing from partners such as NatWest is “massively important” to Chance to Shine, he says, because the children who come to his programme would be “lost” without it. “It’s given them so many experiences, and it keeps them occupied and healthy.”Hussain played in his primary school’s team and, during a local tournament, a coach spotted his talent and asked him to join Clitheroe Cricket Club.There, Hussain, a bowler, and his wicketkeeper friend formed a formidable axis. “We were like the Shane Warne and Ian Healy of the team,” smiles Hussain, remembering how the scorecards seemed to forever feature the legend: “Caught Amin, bowled Hussain.”He was the captain of the junior team, the under-11s, under-13s, the under-15s and onwards. The side he led won the County Championships and went to the north-west finals at Old Trafford in 1984.He says his coach’s impact was profound. “He was a church-goer and he instilled in us a sense of fair play and the importance of respecting the umpire’s decision.“These values went beyond cricket – they were instrumental to my development as a human being. Cricket taught me to have compassion, tolerance and a sense of fair play and respect. I try to replicate that in my Chance to Shine sessions.”He first became interested in coaching around the age of 18. Within a year he was coaching the under-18 side, while continuing to play. He renamed the youth section Clitheroe Cobras and injected energy into the venture, even creating branded clothing for the kids.He took the players on tours and launched a girls’ team in the Lancashire league. Sky Sports made a documentary about the team and awards followed. The Lancashire cricket board also noticed the buzz and introduced Hussain to Chance to Shine, the national cricket charity that works in state schools and communities across England and Wales.The charity invited Hussain to launch a programme in Blackburn, which proved to be an eye-opening experience for him. “Up until then I’d worked with white, middle-class, privileged children for 20 years,” he says.“But with Chance to Shine I began to work with kids who came from poorer backgrounds, who had less parental support, and very few opportunities. Their needs were far greater. It seemed the ideal thing for me to get my teeth into.”He now runs four projects in the Blackburn area. The main project is at Audley junior school, where he takes a “fast and furious” approach to keep the children involved and avoid them becoming bored by the “static” element of the game.There’s little chance of anyone being bored by Hussain, however – he is an electrifying man. At the Audley sessions, he dishes out high fives to the kids and celebrates successes as if the team has won the World Cup.“I try to meet them at their level and keep them enthusiastic,” he says. “I treat every child as if they are my own, and my dream is that one day they will pass their experiences with me on to their own children.”Hussain says he wants to avoid the “elitism you sometimes find in club environments” and instead aims for the guiding principle of Chance to Shine: inclusivity.“Chance to Shine has been an absolute godsend for these children,” he smiles. “I get a great buzz out of it too. When a kid catches the ball or hits the ball, and I see the look of satisfaction on their faces, it’s just priceless.”Looking ahead, he says he is dreaming up new projects and is “bubbling” with ideas. “I’m not one to sit still,” he says. We can all be thankful for that.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

What can I say? I was a 15-year-old girl! I cried my heart out every time. I remember sitting in the first row on opening night because it was otherwise completely sold out. Then I watched it again with friends, and again and again I watched it alone. I went to see it so often the local cinema gave me a free ticket to watch the last showing: I just loved the experience. It was a movie so epic, and until then everyone thought they don’t make them like that any more.I haven’t seen it lately but when my daughters are old enough I will try to find a cinema showing. It won’t be the same for them, of course, but it has to be seen and it is truly a movie that belongs on the big screen. Stephi, AustriaMy friend and I made 17 trips to Leeds city centre to revel in the greatness. Why? The sheer fun of the film, the soundtrack, everything encapsulated who we were at that moment in time. We even managed to collect a fair bit of memorabilia.We went so often that on our last visit we only noticed the rest of the audience’s 3D glasses when the film began. It turned out after 16 viewings in the “main” screen we had been relegated, and had to highfoot it to get to number 17 in time. Stu, AustraliaI couldn’t wait for Grease to be released in September 1978. You’re the One That I Want had topped the charts all summer and every Thursday I’d sit waiting to see the video on Top of the Pops. The world of Rydell High in the 50s was a world away from a 70s Edinburgh council estate. Then a rumour started that Grease would be classified AA, meaning nobody under 14 could see it. I was gutted. Luckily that was wrong, it was an A, and I spent the next 32 Saturday afternoons at the ABC cinema, Lothian Road, watching first a 20-minute short film about skateboarding that had Chris Montez’s Let’s Dance as its theme, then came Danny and Sandy at the beach, Love Is a Many Splendored Thing playing in the background, before the cartoon credits rolled. Sam, EdinburghAfter the whole debacle between Netflix and established cinema chains across the world, I was happy to see that the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam was showing Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma. Not only that, but the screening was in their state-of-the-art Cinema 1, with 4K resolution and beautiful, crisp surround sound. This elevates the already profound experience of Roma to a whole new level: you can feel yourself in the busy streets of Mexico City.I went several times, and took different friends each time. We pretty much all agreed that Roma was meant to be seen on a big screen, with great sound, rather than a tiny computer screen and tinny speakers. This is the kind of film that asks for complete immersion into a time, setting and aesthetic – it is a shame that it couldn’t be experienced that way by the majority of the public. J Medina, AmsterdamI went to see this film six times in the two weeks it played at our local Unit 4. That first time, it took my breath away – I’d never seen anything as captivating. Everything, from the premise to the music, the actors and the action itself (the fight scenes especially) was a revelation to this small-town 20-year-old. Thrilling.I also fell in love with one of the extras, which must’ve been part of the draw (the young woman with the long blonde hair in the Lizzies scene). A week later, myself and a group of friends went to see it again in Rawtenstall: we were passing joints around when suddenly the lights came on and police streamed in and frogmarched us out, into waiting vans. Busted! Martin Peacock, AccringtonWhile I saw the 1982 theatrical cut on TV and really liked it, I fell in love with the director’s cut and saw it four times in two weeks when it was released in cinemas in 1992. This doesn’t sound like much, but if you consider the three different versions of Blade Runner to be “one film”, then I’ve seen it over 20 times at the cinema. They could release a fourth version tomorrow with the only difference being a one-second cut to an incidental scene and I’d be the first to buy a ticket.You really can’t beat seeing those stunning visuals on the big screen and hearing Vangelis’s gorgeous soundtrack in the theatre. I’m lucky that the Astor in Melbourne screens it about once a year, although there’s not one currently scheduled for 2019 (strange given that’s the year the movie is set). Neill Brown, MelbourneI see new details and nuances each time. Recently, for example, I noticed the wire rakes in the garden shop Marion’s boyfriend works in, and their resemblance to skeletal claws. But why was such an image planted there, rather than in the Bates Motel? This kicked off a line of enquiry I will take into my next viewing. I also find seeing the film each time with a new audience helps me to experience it in its totality quite differently. Recent viewings have opened my eyes to its sly humour. Emotionally, I identify with those in the audience seeing the film for the first time and share with them the frisson of its unravelling. Alex, LondonMy 16-year-old daughter and I completely fell in love with this film (we were seeing a lot of Bollywood films at the time), and returned at least six times over the course of a couple of weeks, taking with us various reluctant friends each time. We loved the adventurous characters (played by Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji) and their slow-burn romance, the high-spirited (but never mean-spirited) capers they ran, and their pursuit by a wily cop played by legendary superstar Amitabh Bachchan (Abhishek’s father). We adored the music, lusted after the clothes, and never got tired of it, even after we knew the Hindi dialogue by heart. Laura Boyes, North CarolinaI stumbled on Annie Proulx’s short story and it captivated me. I was in my mid 40s when the movie was released and I went to see it solo at a matinee here in San Francisco. I was so moved I was shaking when I left the cinema and, afraid I was going to burst into tears, had to hide behind a pillar to smoke a cigarette. My hand was trembling as I tried to light it.I went back seven times, sometimes alone and sometimes with friends. I became fixated on certain scenes and would watch them over and over again on YouTube – the story really got under my skin and I spent a year on IMDb discussing it with other fans. Trevor Martin, San FranciscoI turned 20 in the summer of 1989 and went crazy for Tim Burton’s first Batman film. Maybe because it was the first “proper” superhero film since Superman II … maybe it was because it had a great soundtrack by Prince and a moody score by Danny Elfman (I bought both albums on various formats) and maybe because I loved the sartorial choices on display (double-breasted suits and 40s fedoras), but I couldn’t get enough of it.At the time I had a girlfriend in Venice, and when I went in October to visit her the movie had just been released there. Naturally, we went to see the film on a date (her first viewing, my eighth). When we came out she said she loved the moment when Bruce Wayne got shot through his jacket and didn’t notice. My jaw dropped. I’d seen the film so many times and hadn’t noticed that detail. I saw it again recently and I felt no wave of nostalgia, just a sense of huge disappointment. “Is that it?” I thought.

With Marvel waiting in the wings to take charge of the X-Men, following Disney’s merger with 20th Century Fox, it is certainly pretty convenient for the mouse house that X-Men: Dark Phoenix’s pitiful opening US weekend (a mere $33m) ensures this current iteration of the colourful mutants has finally been fed to the Sentinels.A sole outlier, the long-delayed, horror-themed The New Mutants, remains in the can and will probably not be seen until 2020, while Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool is likely to continue in trademark potty-mouthed form at Disney. But after 20 years, during which a dozen movies have been released, the adventure is pretty much over, and it is fair to say that the series will not be overly missed.The best instalments (Deadpool, Logan) have taken place largely outside the main continuum, while the renewed sci-fi energy that seemed to have been pumped into the core chronicle by 2014’s cunningly crafted time travel adventure Days of Future Past has been completely lost during its two sequels. It goes without saying that the X-Men are missing the raw, brooding presence of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine. Quite why the opportunity was never taken to reintroduce the gnarled character in the current timeline (albeit with a new actor pulling on the adamantium claws) is open to question.Dark Phoenix compounds all the issues the core X-Men movies have had at their worst: the surfeit of characters that means we rarely get under the skin of any of them the failure of the story to evolve beyond its key Magneto-Professor X dichotomy the clunky inter-superhero romances. Then it adds new ones such as ham-fisted dialogue that horribly signposts imminent plot shifts dull alien shapeshifters that the movie barely bothers to show in their original form (the contrast with the lively Skrulls in Captain Marvel is palpable) and the death of a major character that underplays their contribution over the past four movies. Did a sense of malaise settle over the Dark Phoenix set once it became obvious that Disney was unlikely to keep the series going in its current form? Could cast and crew simply not be bothered to keep up their energy levels, like an office workplace before Christmas break? Apart from the always-reliable Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy, nobody seems to have made any effort to raise their game – though Simon Kinberg’s tepid script and by-the-numbers direction (not to mention all those reshoots) can hardly have helped .When Matthew Vaughn semi-rebooted the saga with 2011’s passable 60s-set X-Men: First Class, the series gained an engaging Watchmen-esque period veneer that continued with the 70s-set Days of Future Past. Dark Phoenix is ostensibly set in the 90s, but there is little to indicate this, not even a Captain Marvel-style visit to Blockbuster Video. Worse still, the movie has been afflicted by what British director Danny Boyle once referred to as the “moisturiser problem” – namely that Fassbender, McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult look barely a day older than they did eight years ago, even though their characters are supposed to have aged 30 years since First Class. Presumably, in another eight years (Dark Phoenix is set in 1992, while the first X-Men film was made in 2000), McAvoy will morph into noughties Patrick Stewart, which suggests it is going to be a pretty rough decade for Charles Xavier.At least we won’t have to watch that transformation and perhaps it’s best that Marvel will now have to start all over again, presumably after a reasonable period has passed to allow audiences to regain their interest. A Marvel producer recently told the Hollywood Reporter: “There is no rush to bring the X-Men to the marketplace after this. And when they come back, it’s going to extend Marvel’s run another 10 years.”Can we imagine any of these versions of the X-Men, bar those such as Jackman’s Wolverine who have already been written out, having the gravitas to walk straight into the MCU? All things considered, these rather insipid and under-written mutants are probably best left trapped forever in this strange and barely recognisable version of the early 90s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93c683cb91f4da6759d5da52844c6e1c3471c07b/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68ccb31a5f5c562c4e2a5e5f4561a7d5","title":"bread is practically sacred how the taste of home sustained my refugee parents","story":"My parents’ social life in Bosnia (and therefore their children’s) regularly featured a bunch of their friends getting together for a lot of food and drinking and singing and laughing. Nobody would ever call that endeavour “dinner” – the activity revolved around food, but could never be reduced to it. In Bosnian, the verb that describes such an activity is sjediti, which means to sit, as the whole operation consists of sitting around the table, eating, drinking and being together for the purposes of well-earned pleasure. If I want to invoke an image of my parents being unconditionally happy (not an easy task), I envision them with their friends at a table, roaring with laughter between bites of delicious fare and sips of slivovitz (damson or plum brandy) or grappa.This would sometimes last for a whole weekend: sometimes we would go to Boračko jezero, a modest mountain-lake resort, to join my parents’ friends and their families for 1 May, the socialist Labour Day. The inextricable part of the fun and joy there was the presence of others, and the spirit of abandon reigned from morn to midnight and beyond. But the central, inescapable bonding ritual was spit-roasting a lamb that would then be shared by all. There, as everywhere we lived, food was meant to be shared, which is why it is never permissible to eat while someone else is watching and not eating. Food is other people. We hate eating alone, just as we hate being alone.There are no records or memories of my parents ever going out on a dinner date, before or after they got married. There really was no restaurant culture in the Sarajevo of our previous life, even before the war. The restaurants were either expensive or not good, most commonly both. Not even in Canada, where they moved in 1993 as refugees, did my parents acquire a habit of going out for a meal. While Hamilton is not quite a culinary mecca, the primary reason for this reluctance is that visiting a restaurant means my parents would have to leave their zone of hard-won nutritional comfort to encounter a world of food unlikely to meet their strict requirements.Spending money on a meal in an unknown gastronomic territory, and all that in English, while Mama’s cooking is axiomatically the best in the world and their several fridges are full of reliable food, including the already proven leftovers, would just be foolish and irresponsible. In my family, eating is not meant to be an exploration, nor an expansion of cultural experience. Part of the food pleasure is in meeting the set expectations, while its indelible utility is in providing energy for labour, and therefore for survival. Food is an existential necessity, an irreplaceable element in the structure of daily life, and it should never be fucked around with in some expensive place that also happens to be devoid of friends and family.The only Hamilton place where the two of them might venture for a meal is the Mandarin, a Chinese restaurant featuring mounds of fried things and stewed stuff, plus very un-Chinese multilayered cake with industrial-strength frosting. The attraction to the Mandarin is largely a consequence of its all-you-can-eat wonder buffet, wherein the utopian concept of cheap and endless abundance, dreamed of by generations of Slavic peasantry, is finally fulfilled.When my parents were growing up, there was little food, never mind bottomless buffets. As adults, they reached a level of comfort when they had enough and then there was even more, so they took out a loan to buy a freezer in order to stock up. Their poor-people food ethos, where nothing should ever be wasted, aligned perfectly with the fact that unchecked consumption was prohibitive in socialism, everyone getting according to their needs and all that.An aspect of ethical food management was thus always striving to avoid waste, which might be a problem when one is confronting a Chinese buffet, where all that is left uneaten might end up as garbage. I have seen my father at the Mandarin pile on so much food, then soak it with an ungodly combination of sauces on offer, that I would fear he might have a heart attack he would eat all of it, then go for seconds and thirds. Moreover, a need to exploit the buffet and its low price to the max is a crucial part of enjoying it. There is also the pertinent fact that it is not certain, nor can it ever be, that a moment as abundant and enjoyable as this one – what with inexhaustible supplies of fried rice and spring rolls and dumplings and chicken wings – could be counted on to happen again. Eating more, beyond being full, means extending this safe and pleasurable moment, for the next one is never guaranteed you eat now, for who knows what is around the bend? The food intake is proportional to the uncertainty of the future. This is, by the way, how I gained 40lbs after I arrived on a cultural exchange trip in the spring of 1992 and decided to stay as the threat of war was looming over my home.Food can never be enjoyed unto itself it is never just a sensory experience, let alone a matter of sophisticated taste. Its meaning is always dependent on the outcomes of potentially catastrophic situations, its value always assigned in the context of particular lives and histories. Taste as such has no purchase, for it is impossible to orce the experience of eating from the constant practice of survival. Even if one eats to enjoy life, one has to stay alive first, which requires far more than merely entertaining the senses. The restaurant critics who pretend that their expert epicurean taste entitles them to evaluate food are nothing but fools who think that something as basic as eating could be objectively appraised.Once or twice I took my parents to a white-tablecloth restaurant within my financial reach, insisting that they must enjoy the experience. Instead, they were confused by the long, convoluted descriptions of the dishes, suspicious of the server’s solicitude and pessimistic about the nutritional value of the pretty arrangement. “We’ll be hungry in an hour,” Mama would pronounce, inescapably projecting into the unstable future. In a stable, leisure-oriented world, being hungry in an hour would mean that you would simply eat in an hour. But as far as my parents are concerned, no one knows what might happen in an hour. At the very least, they might be working on something that would not allow them to stop, since hunger would only impede them from getting it done.The bizarre thing about the very concept of the restaurant, so obvious as to be invisible, is that it is a place where strangers serve strange food to strangers, knowing absolutely nothing about what they like, about what they think, about who they are, about what their life history is. Restaurant food is impersonal, uncommunal, consumed in the isolation of public space. In my parents’ culinary universe, pleasure and perfection are achieved by generations of fine-tuning, adjusting it all to the personal preferences. Mama cooks what has been cooked by all the other women in Bosnia Tata asks her to make his favorite dishes in the way he likes them, and she does so. What restaurant can provide that kind of service? This creates mutual psychological collaboration between them, an addictive and symbiotic food-centered operation wherein Tata gathers (shopping) and produces (smoked meat, honey) the supplies for Mama to transform them into food.In my family, food is part of a complex system of knowledge that has its own hierarchy of value, wherein meat and bread are at the top. Meat is appreciated in all its variations: cuts, smoked meat, sausage, spit-roasted. It has inherent value because, in the peasant past, it never came from a butcher or a supermarket, but from living creatures whose numbers measured wealth, who might have had names and spent winters in the house with the family.The value of meat was also proportional to the work it took to put it on the table. This is why vegetables have always been considered inferior. Although tending the garden takes some work, vegetables just grow, and when you want to eat them you just cut them or add them to the meat – vegetables contained no drama, they could not be given names, nor could they ever become a measure of wealth and property. Vegetables are thus tolerated for being inherently a side dish, not quite real food. Although vegetarians might be respected (if ever encountered), they are hard to understand. The choice not to eat meat implies levels of comfort and privilege few of us have ever managed to reach. My family cannot quite fathom it. Why eat only broccoli when you can eat any meat you want?Bread, on the other hand, is practically sacred. In Bosnian, there is an idiom applicable to a saintly good person: “As good as bread.” Although it does take land and hard work to produce wheat and grind it into flour that will become dough to be kneaded and baked into bread, its symbolic value has less to do with all the effort than with the fact that it is the poor people’s most basic staple – if you have bread, you have food, and if you have food, you live. Bread, in another words, equals life. My father’s favourite expression for work is “earning a crust of bread” while my mother (and everyone I know) harbours a deep respect for bread. She used to admonish us for not leaving it on its flat side but upside down, as that is somehow disrespectful. Nor is bread ever thrown away. My grandmother and aunts made a dish from old bread called popara: they steamed the stale bread and added lard to cover up the strong undertones of mould. I make French toast for my kids after I pick the mouldy bits off an old loaf.In my parents’ ethical universe, a portion of which could always be found in their fridge, leftovers play an important role. To throw food away is a sin against the generations of poverty. This is also why a special value is ascribed to the last and smallest edible particles: to the meat around the joint bone, to the heel of bread or to the burnt potato sticking to the bottom of the roasting pan. I was brought up to believe that these were particularly tasty, only to undergo an epiphany a few years ago, realising in a single painful moment that it was all poor people’s bullshit, nothing but peasant propaganda, ensuring that even the tiniest, unpleasant morsels are eaten and nothing is ever thrown away.Hence my parents’ fridge is always full: apart from what is needed daily (dairy, meat, wilted vegetables), there is the stuff that awaits its final consumption: half a sausage that may be weeks old eggs scrambled once upon a time but presently nurturing their own little colonies of living organisms the week-old soup in a little pot covered with a saucer which my mother will retrieve a moment before it goes bad to reheat it for my father. My parents can’t throw away food, just as I can’t kill a living thing – something deep inside us, some cellular moral law, prohibits such an act. Not so long ago, I undertook a heroic effort to clean my parents’ main fridge. Two swollen garbage bags later, the fridge still appeared full, as though possessed by some magic wherein the more you take out, the fuller it gets.This food hoarding – if that’s what it is – is not necessarily related to my parents’ personal memories of hunger. Mama does not remember ever being hungry or worrying about food. Tata was only hungry after leaving his parents’ home to go to the boarding school, where there never was enough food for an adolescent boy, but that lasted only until he got his first stipend. In another words, they never, not even during the wars they lived through, experienced systemic deprivation that would constitute an existential threat. Their food anxieties are rooted in a shared history in which subsistence could never be guaranteed, where living was always survival and where food abundance was ever temporary, at least by virtue of being seasonal, entirely dependent on hard work and weather and luck.And even if my parents rose out of poverty to become socialist middle-class, they learned that the structure of comfort they had spent their lives building offered no protection from history, which would, in the early 90s, come crashing down on their heads. Whatever food anxieties may have lessened with middle-class stability were doubly reactivated with the war, which totally validated the survivalist food ethics they had been so familiar with.The value of leftovers is also rooted in a particular domestic economy and the gendered ision of labour. Since time immemorial until, at best, my parents’ generation, women were the ones expected to manage food, in addition to rearing children and all the other domestic duties. Grandma Mihaljina spent her life between the kitchen and attending to the livestock and various small children, first hers, then her children’s. Grandpa Ivan would work in the field, and then come to the house for a meal – bread, borscht, pierogi, steranka – that she would prepare from scratch. She would save everything that was not eaten – and this also before they had a fridge – to serve it again until it was all gone. Leftovers equalled time and labour that she could put into other chores or, rarely, rest.Grandma’s food was a conduit that transmitted love. Peasant women worked too hard and too much to find time to cuddle and play with the kids instead, they would make their favourite dishes. This is another source for the ethical value of food – it carried love. Back in the day, upon Tata’s return from some long trip of his, Mama would make a zucchini pie (tikvenjača), thus expressing whatever happiness she might have felt for having him home. These days, when she comes to visit me, she insists on making something she believes I like and crave. Sadly, my diet and tastebuds have changed, so there is less and less of her comfort food that I long for. She gets hurt when I reject something she prepared for me, and I have to concede and allow her to actualise her love in the form of apples stuffed with walnuts and poached in honey. So for days after her departure, as I devour tufahije, my caloric intake triples.When my grandmother died, my father was working in Africa. He received the news while staying at the Kinshasa Intercontinental, and could not get back in time for her funeral. Alone and devastated, he spent nights pacing in his impersonal hotel room, obsessively recollecting something that happened in Bosnia some 20 or so years before: he dropped by his parents’ because he was nearby for work he surprised his mother and she was so happy to see him that she decided to make his favourite pie. At incredible speed, she peeled and shredded the apples and made the dough and stretched it thin and rolled it up with the apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture inside, put it in the oven to bake for 40 minutes or so. But he was young and impatient and could not wait and, even though she begged him to stay for the pie, he left before it was done. Twenty years later, in the Kinshasa hotel room, he beat his chest and ripped his hair out for not staying, longing hopelessly for that untasted apple pie, for that moment that could never be retrieved nor relived.For my sister Kristina and me, “apple pie” has become a code term for a situation where our negligence toward our parents is likely to result in some devastating future regret. “I won’t be coming to see them for Christmas,” I would say. She would only say, “apple pie”, and I would be coming to see them for Christmas.A few years ago, my father went to see a doctor, who diagnosed him with high blood pressure and instructed him to cut red meat out of his diet. A week or so later, I called to see how things were going. Tata picked up the phone. What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m eating bacon,” he said with no compunction whatsoever. I immediately started yelling: “Didn’t the doctor tell you not to eat red meat, and now you’re eating bacon?”“It’s not red, the bacon,” he said. “It’s all white.”For my parents, one of the symptoms of my having become “American” is my new fussiness in relation to food – I seem to pay too much finicky attention to my diet. When I go to visit them, I berate them for eating bacon, force them to eat fish (“We’ll be hungry in an hour”), and steam vegetables instead of roasting them. For some dubious future health benefit, I deny them – as I do myself – the food they have always eaten and enjoyed. To my mind, I practise as much dietary recklessness as the next Bosnian, but what my parents see is not so much a radical change in nutritional content as a shift in attitude.To my parents, seeking health by way of self-deprivation makes no sense whatsoever. Food has always equalled survival, which is to say that the more and the better food was available, the greater the chances of survival were. Throughout my childhood, my mother would insist that “health enters through the mouth”.Moreover, food is joy. It is joy because it contains pleasures earned by work it is joy because it can be shared with other people it is joy because it is life and life is a really good and healthy thing, incomparably better than any spiritual endeavour contingent upon morally rewarding self-mortification. The systemic extermination of joy in the US is not only unethical but also plain stupid. There is no reasonable argument that could be made against the pleasures of bacon, let alone the bacon my father cut and smoked himself. Only after I berated my parents a few times (and I might do it again) for their over-enjoyment of food did I realise that, compared to them, I did become American and thus, to some extent, puritan.The value and meaning of food is always necessarily altered, just like everything else, by displacement. For one thing, “our” food is either unavailable or scarce in the new place, at least it was at the beginning. Therefore, it becomes a mark of loss, which makes it essential for all nostalgic discourse. For years after their arrival, my mother would deliver analytical soliloquies on, say, the ineffable yet substantial differences between “our” sour cream and the Canadian (“their”) kind. The authenticity of “our” food exactly matches the authenticity of our life in the past. Conversely, the inauthenticity of our life in displacement can be tasted in “their” food. In Mama’s discourse, our sour cream is a stable category, possessing unchanging qualities correlating to the unchanging, authentic principles that guided our previous life – the principles that were violated and, indeed, destroyed by the war and subsequent displacement.Our food, in other words, stands for the authentic life we used to live, which is no longer available except as a model for this new, elsewhere life. It is therefore important that the food-related practices from the previous life be reconstructed in the new context. The food, if made properly, might be where authenticity is partially restored, despite the displacement. While that authenticity was available in the previous life, it requires tremendous effort to rebuild it in the new one, where the torturous possibility that nothing could ever be the way it used to be is continuously present, like a big nose on a face.This idea is best expressed in a story I heard in Sarajevo from someone who had heard it from someone else, who, in turn, knew the person who knew the person to whom all this happened. In short, the story is true as can be, even if I fact-checked none of it, because it accumulated relevant experiences and value while passing through other people.So: a Bosnian refugee – let’s call him Zaim – ends up in some small town in the US. Life is tough, there are few friends, the family is far away and the longing for Bosnia is painful. Zaim develops a craving for spit-roasted lamb, the most universally revered food in Bosnia. He wants to do it the way it is supposed to be done – stick a whole lamb on a spit and then slowly revolve it for hours over fire and embers, sipping beer and talking to people, until it is finished. Though piecemeal lamb is available, a whole one is not. Zaim finds himself in some town rife with malls and megamarkets. There is everything there, except, of course, a whole lamb. In his profound craving for spit-roasted lamb, Zaim purchases all the pieces needed to assemble a whole lamb: the head, the neck, the breast, the shoulders, the chops, the ribs, the legs. When he collects all the necessary parts, he staples them together. So there it is: a monstrous lamb, which man and history rent asunder, but is now put back together by a determined Bosnian, who, beer in hand, proudly and slowly revolves it over the fire. Despite the heroic effort, it still doesn’t taste the same.After more than 20 years in displacement, my parents have assembled a life, nutritional and otherwise, that aimed to be a restorative replica of the previous one, but is in fact a Frankensteinian assemblage of elements old and new. They eat everything they would have been eating if they had stayed in Bosnia, even if it can be hard work to get all the stuff. They depend on their ingenuity as well as on several stores catering to people from the former Yugoslavia. But the meaning of it all has changed in displacement. Whereas what they ate in Bosnia was typical, an important part of the totality of shared experience, in Canada it makes them appear of a different, exotic world. Their nutritional philosophy is not what connects them to their surroundings, but what sets them apart. They make their food to taste of home, but it inescapably ends up having the taste of displacement.This is an edited extract from My Parents: An IntroductionThis Does Not Belong to You by Aleksandar Hemon, published by MCD• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9f344cda347f101405ac414497515bdaa307f6/42_0_3337_2003/master/3337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8848cfa7d49acea9537bdf6c306c36f7","title":"real madrid lyon ferland mendy signing antoine griezmann barcelona","story":"• Left-back Ferland Mendy moves to Bernabéu for £42.7m• Atlético expect French forward to join Spanish championsReal Madrid have signed the Lyon left-back Ferland Mendy, making the defender the third summer addition to their squad.While across the city, the Atlético chief executive, Miguel Ángel Gil Marín, believes Antoine Griezmann will join Barcelona this summer – and insisted he has known about the move since March.Real announced on Wednesday that Mendy will sign a six-year contract, with Lyon saying the transfer was worth €48m (£42.7m).The 24-year-old’s signing comes a week after Real also bought Eden Hazard from Chelsea for £88.5m and the forward Luka Jovic from Eintracht Frankfurt for £65m.Mendy joined Lyon from Le Harve in 2017 and scored three goals in 44 appearances last season. He made his debut for France in a friendly against Uruguay in November.Griezmann announced last month he would leave Atlético this summer after spending five seasons in the Spanish capital. Barcelona have long been linked with a move for the France forward and the 28-year-old has a release clause in his contract that the Spanish champions are reportedly ready to trigger.While no official offer has been made, Gil Marín said he has been aware of Griezmann’s next destination for the last three months. “It’s crystal clear where he is going to play, I’ve known since March. At Barcelona,” he told the Spanish TV station Movistar Toros on Wednesday.Griezmann moved to Atlético from Real Sociedad in 2014 and helped the club win the Europa League in 2018, scoring twice in the final against Marseille.Earlier on Wednesday, Jovic was officially unveiled at the Bernabéu, the striker declaring that he was the “happiest man in the world”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25bd0506a5272e4e12566e7dd9d36abbf1f7b1cf/0_110_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a60b18d0d2a7edb227164ed2f6df1c89","title":"premier league football fixtures 2019 20 manchester united host chelsea opening weekend ","story":"Manchester City will start the defence of their Premier League title at West Ham. The 2019-20 fixtures, announced on Thursday morning, handed Pep Guardiola’s team an opening match at a venue which has proved to be productive for them since 2017.City, who have won successive Premier League titles, have picked up three points in east London in the last three seasons – scoring four goals on each occasion.The champions follow their 10 August lunchtime trip to the London Stadium with a home match against Tottenham. Games against Bournemouth, Brighton, Norwich and Watford follow.Liverpool, pipped by a point to the title by City, get next season up and running on Friday, 9 August at home to newly-promoted Norwich. Clashes against Southampton, Arsenal, Burnley, Newcastle and Chelsea round out their first six fixtures.Last season’s top two meet at Anfield on 9 November, subject to TV confirmation, with the return at the Etihad scheduled for 4 April.The run-in would also appear to favour City, who do not face any teams who finished in the top half last season in their final six matches, following that visit of Liverpool. In contrast, Jürgen Klopp’s side have a home game against Chelsea sandwiched between trips to Arsenal and Newcastle.Manchester United, who finished sixth last time around, have an eye-catching opener, at home to Chelsea on Sunday, 11 August. Whether Maurizio Sarri is still in charge of the visitors remains to be seen, with the 60-year-old Italian linked with the vacant managerial role at Juventus.Arsenal start at Newcastle, also on the Sunday, with the other opening day fixtures taking place on the Saturday. The evening match sees Aston Villa, who secured a top-flight return with victory over Derby in the Championship play-off final, face a tough opener at Spurs - who finished fourth last season.The other newly promoted team, Sheffield United, start at Bournemouth – meaning the Cherries’ Wales international winger David Brooks could line up against the team he left last July.There is a sense of deja vu as Watford host Brighton in a repeat of last season’s opening match, while Turf Moor opponents Burnley and Southampton faced each other at St Mary’s first time around in 2018-19.Elsewhere, Crystal Palace are at home to Everton and there is a Midlands derby with Wolves travelling to Leicester.Pep Guardiola\u0027s back-to-back Premier League champions renew their rivalry with Jürgen Klopp\u0027s European champions in their first meeting since landing their latest respective silverware. Liverpool pushed City all the way in an epic title race last season and have home advantage as they bid to draw first blood in pursuit of their first domestic crown in 30 years. Guardiola\u0027s side will be equally determined to maintain the edge after beating the Reds 2-1 in their previous encounter in January as they bid for a domestic league hat-trick.\u0026nbspLiverpool were crowned European champions for a sixth time after beating Tottenham in Madrid 12 days ago and the north London side will want revenge. The pair are sure to challenge for a top-four finish in the 2019-20 campaign and this Anfield clash will be an indicator of their title credentials. The Reds won both league matches 2-1 last season and have 10 wins and only one defeat in their last 15 meetings in all competitions.\u0026nbspChelsea secured a comprehensive 4-1 victory against Arsenal in this summer\u0027s other all-English European final to lift the Europa League trophy for a second time. If the Gunners can avenge their painful defeat in Baku in their first meeting since, it might go a little way to appeasing those fans who are growing ever louder in their criticism of the club\u0027s inability to compete with the top four.

See you next seasonI recently wrote an article explaining how I’d given up my Champions League final ticket to watch the game with my dad. He gave me a love of Spurs that meant it was the right thing to do. It was well received. Real journalists slid into my DMs to praise me. Ex- pros texted me (well, one ex-pro texted me). What an altruistic gesture. What a moving piece. You should write more they all said. I was a hero.A cynic might argue that writing an article about liking both your own father and football was likely to resonate with an audience of people – many of whom also have, or had, fathers and also like football.But that’s not the point. Here was someone (me) from within the football establishment who still understood the real fan – a rare breed among the oil barons, corrupt officials, overpaid players and slightly less overpaid broadcasters.Now all I needed to do was put this powerful but very simple gesture into practice. How difficult could if be to watch a football match on TV with my dad?On the morning of the game I woke up in Madrid with one of those expected but brutal hangovers. The Spanish heat even at 8am was too much. My taxi driver to the airport drove too fast and wanted to talk. I tried every liquid going at the airport – water, coffee, Coke, Yop – nothing did the trick.Back in London, and feeling pretty ropey, I went for a nap before the game. Dad was getting the 4.15 from Cambridge – plenty of time. I’d watched every round with a Spurrsy crowd (well, four of us), so they all agreed to come over, and I bought the kettle chips and the posh triumvirate of Waitrose dips, salsa, tzatziki and guacamole. What a night we’d have.I woke up at 5pm, and checked my phone at 5.01pm. Dad (missed call). Dad (missed call). Dad (missed call). Two missed calls is normal behaviour, normally followed by a WhatsApp with all manner of predictive text mistakes, curious spacing and lacking even the most basic punctuation. Decipherable, but only with practice.“Hi Max. Just got home. Not sure if you’ve seen my text messagesApparently not a bus service to ivll St but no certainty of late trains plus as far as I can see from the Web the late ones are very slow and the fast ones go vie King s Cross. Sou ds odd…. I ll call soon…… I ll miss not seeing it with youI rang. We laughed. “This doesn’t help the narrative,” I said. I could drive to Cambridge, but I had people over and work in the morning. Dad had a whiskey and was in his favourite armchair and had “managed to find BT Sport” on his Virgin box. Fair enough.I wondered how I’d explain this away – perhaps never mention it. No one would know. It would be our secret. And after all, we don’t normally watch the games together. We watch them separately, on our own TVs and then talk about it afterwards. If anything this would be even more authentic.I checked national rail enquires. The trains had started up again. I messaged. “The 18,44 seems to be running”.Dad’s response: “Off to srTjon”.For some reason Dad jumped on the Liverpool Street line – a route that stops at every town, village and park bench between the two cities. His ETA was 7.50pm. My friends arrived, we got going on the dips and watched the buildup. Kane and Winks starting. Was that good? We weren’t sure.The Champions League theme. No sign of Dad. No blue ticks on WhatsApp. Not even two ticks. Just one.Kick-off. No sign of Dad. Penalty to Liverpool. No sign of Dad.The doorbell rang five minutes in. I poured Dad a glass of red wine and we watched the game. Just after Origi scored I ordered him an Uber. He left before full-time. The game was over and it’d be good to get the 22.12 back home. I offered him the spare room, but he had string quartet in the morning. That cello wasn’t going to play itself.I opened another beer and watched Jordan Henderson’s trophy lift. I texted Mum. “Call when he’s home.” My friends left and I went to bed.The 22.12 was cancelled. Dad walked to St Pancras. He got on the Thameslink. He got a table. It was empty. Until the next stop. Hundreds of Spurs fans got on. “I’m a pisshead,” announced the man opposite Dad.The cab ride from Cambridge station to my parents house is 10 minutes. Unfortunately the queue was a mile long. Dad walked. He got home just before 1am.If I hadn’t written the first article, he could have had a relaxing evening. Instead, I forced an 80-year-old man to leave his whiskey, his armchair and the peace and quiet of his living room, to take a 90-minute train journey in the searing heat so he could watch most of a football match with six people he didn’t know and then take a three-hour journey home in the middle of the night. I guess we’ll always have those 86 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da460b6033290bc76dcc96285c616b125eca03b6/44_151_1529_917/master/1529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ca19b2ed5914a74c79c96f7d7cca5d","title":"state projects leave tens of thousands of lives in the balance in ethiopia study","story":"Giant dam and irrigated sugar plantations mean people in lower Omo valley face starvation and conflict, says US thinktankA giant dam and irrigated sugar plantations are “wreaking havoc” in southern Ethiopia and threaten to wipe out tens of thousands of indigenous peoples , a US-based thinktank has claimed.The Oakland Institute says that while the Ethiopian government has made considerable progress on human rights under prime minister Abiy Ahmed, it has yet to address the impact of state development plans on indigenous populations in the lower Omo valley, where people face loss of livelihoods, starvation, and violent conflict .Acute hunger is now widespread, the organisation said in a report, due to blockage of the Omo River by Gibe III, Africa’s tallest dam. Since late 2015, the dam has stopped the river’s annual flood, a natural event that the valley’s inhabitants have relied upon for centuries for farming. As a result, entire communities have been tipped into destitution.Responding to the report, Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s minister of water, irrigation and electricity , said that while the government accepts there are problems, “the points raised in the paper are not properly documented or balanced”.Seleshi said solutions had been put in place to mitigate the impact of the dam, including small-scale irrigation and outgrower schemes.According to the report, however, such promises have not materialised. Moreover, said the study, communities claim they were tricked into leaving their ancestral land in order to make way for sugar plantations built by the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation as part of its mammoth Omo-Kuraz sugar development project (OKSDP). The project, a 100,000 hectare (247,000 acre) irrigated agricultural scheme, is fed by the waters of the Omo.Indigenous populations were told the sugar plantations would bring hundreds of thousands of new jobs to the region. They were pressed to give up nomadic livestock-herding and adopt sedentary lifestyles, as part of the Ethiopian government’s controversial “villagisation” programme, which has since been halted. Some were threatened with having their cattle seized or killed by police.The report alleges that resettlement sites are not big enough to feed families, and that promised services – schooling, healthcare, grinding mills, food aid, and electricity – either remain undelivered or have been woefully inadequate. Only a small percentage of new jobs have materialised, with a large majority given to migrant workers from other regions of Ethiopia.Seleshi countered that the Sugar Corporation had spent 79m Ethiopian birr (£2.1m) constructing infrastructure and social services in the valley, including schools and health centres.In May, the  visited a “villagisation” site – Napusmoria, in the South Omo district of Nyangatom – and spoke to villagers whose accounts echoed the report’s claims.Nalia, an elderly inhabitant, said the government ordered her and her family to move to the new village in 2011.“They promised us services, like water, a health clinic and a plot of irrigated land,” she said. “But apart from some food at the start there was nothing.”This is Oakland’s fourth report on South Omo. In 2013 it accused the Ethiopian government of using killings, beatings and rapes in order to force indigenous communities to accept the sugar cane projects. It also accused western aid agencies of covering up evidence of the abuses.Other international groups such as Human Rights Watch and Survival International have also condemned the government for abuses in South Omo in the past.Desalegn Tekle Loyale, a doctoral student at Addis Ababa University who grew up in the valley, said the government did not engage with local communities before commencing the project.“None of us have been consulted,” he said. “We just heard the dam had already started – nothing else.”Benedikt Kamski, a researcher at Freiburg’s Arnold-Bergstraesser Institute whose doctorate was on the OKSDP, said previous opportunities to mitigate some of the project’s harmful impacts had been missed.“Setbacks in the project led to a certain rethinking within the Sugar Corporation concerning the implementation and how local communities should be involved,” he said. “However, financial bottlenecks, political pressure, and above all the government’s vision of development seem to have prevented a change of course.”Despite criticism, Abiy’s administration has pledged to finalise the sugar projects. In October 2018, at the inauguration of Omo-Kuraz III Sugar Factory, the prime minister said earlier problems had been “alleviated” and spoke of a need “to march forward”.Seleshi said it would be wrong to assume “the traditional way of living was great and had no problems”.He added that “irrigated agriculture is more advantageous because it can produce up to three harvests per year”.Yet there are some signs of a change in approach.At an April seminar on South Omo’s livelihood challenges, held in Addis Ababa government minister Seyoum Mesfin told visiting academics and journalists that the new government recognised certain “development interventions in the pastoralist areas … came with a cost.”The minister cited, in particular, “megaprojects like Gibe III” and added that the government “will not allow a repeat of those situations”.Access to South Omo for journalists and researchers has also opened up significantly since last year – signalling a shift away from a policy that in the past meant reporters were denied permits or escorted from the region by police.“Since Abiy came to power researchers are being treated differently, especially with regards to information sharing,” said Kamski. “This is indeed a promising development and should be taken as a cue for instigating constructive dialogue and the joint development of mitigation measures.”Others are proposing ways to soften the impact of Gibe III and OKSDP.“All options should be on the table in terms of sharing the benefits from these projects,” said Jed Stevenson, an anthropologist at Durham University, who suggested wider access to irrigation for local communities, as well as schemesallowing them a share of the profits from crops grown on plantations.Meanwhile, some have continued to call for controlled release of flood waters from the dam, at least until local people are able to move away from their traditional livelihoods – although experts have warned this would mean a significant loss in hydropower revenue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

This brings a bigger question: what does it mean to be genetically Jewish? And can you prove religious identity scientifically?After arriving in Eastern Europe around a millennia ago, the company’s website explained, Jewish communities remained segregated, by force and by custom, mixing only occasionally with local populations. Isolation and intermarriage slowly narrowed the gene pool, which now gives modern Jews of European descent, like my family, a set of identifiable genetic variations that set them apart from other European populations at a microscopic level.This genetic explanation of my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry came as no surprise. According to family lore, my forebears lived in small towns and villages in Eastern Europe for at least a few hundred years, where they kept their traditions and married within the community, up until the Holocaust, when they were either murdered or dispersed.But still, there was something disconcerting about our Jewishness being “confirmed” by a biological test. After all, the reason my grandparents had to leave the towns and villages of their ancestors was because of ethno-nationalism emboldened by a racialized conception of Jewishness as something that exists “in the blood”.The raw memory of this racism made any suggestion of Jewish ethnicity slightly taboo in my family. If I ever mentioned that someone “looked Jewish” my grandmother would respond, “Oh really? And what exactly does a Jew look like?” Yet evidently, this wariness of ethnic categorization didn’t stop my parents from sending swab samples from the inside of their cheeks off to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company. The idea of having an ancient identity “confirmed” by modern science was too alluring.Not that they’re alone. As of the beginning of this year, more than 26 million people have taken at-home DNA tests. For most, like my parents, genetic identity is assimilated into an existing life story with relative ease, while for others, the test can unearth family secrets or capsize personal narratives around ethnic heritage.But as these genetic databases grow, genetic identity is re-shaping not only how we understand ourselves, but how we can be identified by others. In the past year, law enforcement has become increasingly adept at using genetic data to solve cold cases a recent study shows that even if you haven’t taken a test, chances are you can be identified by authorities via genealogical sleuthing.What is perhaps more concerning, though, is how authorities around the world are also beginning to use DNA to not only identify iniduals, but to categorize and discriminate against entire groups of people.In February of this year, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, reported that the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the peak religious authority in the country, had been requesting DNA tests to confirm Jewishness before issuing some marriage licenses.In Israel, matrimonial law is religious, not civil. Jews can marry Jews, but intermarriage with Muslims or Christians is legally unacknowledged. This means that when a Jewish couple want to tie the knot, they are required by law to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate according to Orthodox tradition, which defines Jewish ancestry as being passed down through the mother.While for most Israeli Jews this simply involves handing over their mother’s birth or marriage certificate, for many recent immigrants to Israel, who often come from communities where being Jewish is defined differently or documentation is scarce, producing evidence that satisfies the Rabbinate’s standard of proof can be impossible.In the past, confirming Jewishness in the absence of documentation has involved contacting rabbis from the countries where people herald or tracking genealogical records back to prove religious continuity along the matrilineal line. But as was reported in Haaretz, and later confirmed by David Lau, the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, in the past year, the rabbis have been requesting that some people undergo a DNA test to verify their claim before being allowed to marry.For many Israelis, news that the rabbinical judges were turning to DNA testing was shocking, but for Seth Farber, an American-born Orthodox rabbi, it came as no surprise. Farber, who has been living in Israel since the 1990s, is the director of Itim, the Jewish Life Information Center, an organization that helps Israeli Jews navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. In the past year, the organization has seen up to 50 cases where families have been asked to undergo DNA tests to certify their Jewishness.Those being asked to take these tests, Farber told me, are mostly Russian speaking Israelis, members of an almost 1 million strong immigrant community who began moving to Israel from countries of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Due to the fact that Jewish life was forcefully suppressed during the Soviet era, many members of this community lack the necessary documentation to prove Jewishness through matrilineal descent. This means that although most self-identify as Jewish, hundreds of thousands are not considered so by the Rabbinate, and routinely have their Jewish status challenged when seeking religious services, including marriage.For almost two decades, Farber and his colleagues have advocated for this immigrant community in the face of what they see as targeted discrimination. In cases of marriage, Farber acts as a type of rabbinical lawyer, pulling together documentation and making a case for his clients in front of a board of rabbinical judges. He fears that DNA testing will place even more power in the hands of the Rabbinate and further marginalize the Russian speaking community. “It’s as if the rabbis have become technocrats,” he told me. “They are using genetics to give validity to their discriminatory practices.”Despite public outrage and protests in central Tel Aviv, the Rabbinate have not indicated any intention of ending DNA testing, and reports continue to circulate in the Israeli media of how the test is being used. One woman allegedly had to ask her mother and aunt for genetic material to prove that she was not adopted. Another man was asked to have his grandmother, sick with dementia, take a test.Boris Shindler, a political activist and active member of the Russian speaking community, told me that he believes that the full extent of the practice remains unknown, because many of those who have been tested are unwilling to share their stories publicly out of a sense of shame. “I was approached by someone who was married in a Jewish ceremony maybe 15, 20 years ago, who recently received an official demand saying if you want to continue to be Jewish, we’d like you to do a DNA test,” Shindler said. “They said if she doesn’t do it then she has to sign papers saying she is not Jewish. But she is too humiliated to go to the press with this.”What offends Shindler most is that the technique is being used to single out his community, which he sees as part of a broader stigmatization of Russian speaking immigrants in Israeli society as unassimilated outsiders and second-class citizens. “It is sad because in the Soviet Union we were persecuted for being Jewish and now in Israel we’re being discriminated against for not being Jewish enough,” he said.But according to Yosef Carmel, an Orthodox rabbi and co-head of Eretz Hemdah, a Jerusalem-based institute that trains rabbinical judges for the Rabbinate, this is a misunderstanding of how the DNA testing is being used. He explained that the Rabbinate are not using a generalized Jewish ancestry test, but one that screens for a specific variant on the mitochondrial DNA – DNA that is passed down through the mother – that can be found almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews.For David Goldstein, professor of medical research in genetics at Columbia University whose 2008 book, Jacob’s Legacy: A Genetic View of Jewish History, outlines a decade’s worth of research into Jewish population genetics, translating scientific insights about small genetic variants in the DNA to normative judgments about religious or ethnic identity is not only problematic, but misunderstands what the science actually signals.“When we say that there is a signal of Jewish ancestry, it’s a highly specific statistical analysis done over a population,” he said. “To think that you can use these type of analyses to make any substantive claims about politics or religion or questions of identity, I think that it’s frankly ridiculous.”But others would disagree. As DNA sequencing becomes more sophisticated, the ability to identify genetic differences between human populations has improved. Geneticists can now locate variations in the DNA so acutely as to differentiate populations living on opposite sides of a mountain range.In recent years, a number of high-profile commentators have appropriated these scientific insights to push the idea that genetics can determine who we are socially, none more controversially than the former New York Times science writer, Nicholas Wade. In his 2014 book, A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History, Wade argues that genetic differences in human populations manifest in predictable social differences between those groups. His book was strongly denounced by almost all prominent researchers in the field as a shoddy incarnation of race science, but the idea that our DNA can determine who we are in some social sense has also crept into more mainstream perspectives.In an op-ed published in the New York Times last year, the Harvard geneticist David Reich argued that although genetics does not substantiate any racist stereotypes, differences in genetic ancestry do correlate to many of today’s racial constructs. “I have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries could be misused to justify racism,” he wrote. “But as a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among ‘races’.”Reich’s op-ed was shared widely and drew condemnation from other geneticists and social science researchers.In an open letter to Buzzfeed, a group of 67 experts also criticized Reich’s careless communication of his ideas. The signatories worried that imprecise language within such a fraught field of research would make the insights of population genetics more susceptible to being “misunderstood and misinterpreted”, lending scientific validity to racist ideology and ethno-nationalist politics.And indeed, this already appears to be happening. In the United States, white nationalists have channeled the ideals of racial purity into an obsession with the reliability of direct-to-consumer DNA testing. In Greece, the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party regularly draw on studies on the origins of Greek DNA to “prove” 4,000 years of racial continuity and ethnic supremacy.Most concerning is how the conflation of genetics and racial identity is being mobilized politically. In Australia, the far-right One Nation party recently suggested that First Nations people be given DNA tests to “prove” how Indigenous they are before receiving government benefits. In February, the New York Times reported that authorities in China are using DNA testing to determine whether someone is of Uighur ancestry, as part of a broader campaign of surveillance and oppression against the Muslim minority.While DNA testing in Israel is still limited to proving Jewishness in relation to religious life, it comes at a time when the intersection of ethnic, political, and religious identity are becoming increasingly blurry. Just last year, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government passed the Nation State law, which codified that the right to national self-determination in the country is “unique to the Jewish people”.Shlomo Sand, an Israeli historian who has written extensively on the politics of Jewish population genetics, worries that if DNA testing is normalized by the Rabbinate, it could be used to confirm citizenship in the future. “Israeli society is becoming more of a closed, ethno-centric society,” he said. “I am worried that people will start to use this genetic testing to build this political national identity.”For Sand, there is a particularly dark irony that this type of genetic discrimination is being weaponized by Jews against other Jews. “I am the descendant of Holocaust survivors, people who suffered because of biological and essentialist attitudes to human groups,” he told me. “When I hear stories of people using DNA to prove that you are a Jew, or French, or Greek, or Finnish, I feel like the Nazis lost the war, but they won the victory of an ideology of essentialist identity through the blood.”But for Seth Farber, the problem with a DNA test for Jewishness runs deeper than politics it contravenes what he believes to be the essence of Jewish identity. There is a specific principle in Jewish law, he told me, that instructs rabbis not to undermine someone’s self-declared religious identity if that person has been accepted by a Jewish community. The central principle is that when it comes to Jewish identity, the most important determinants are social – trust, kinship, commitment – not biological. “Our tradition has always been that if someone lives among us and partakes in communal and religious life, then they are one of us,” Farber said. “Just because we have 23andMe doesn’t mean that we should abandon this. That would be an unwarranted and radical re-interpretation of Jewish law.”As I was reporting this story, it often struck me as oxymoronic that an institution like the Rabbinate would embrace new technology to uphold an ancient identity. It seemed to contradict the very premise of Orthodoxy, which, by definition, is supposed to rigidly maintain tradition in the face of all that is new and unknown.But Jessica Mozersky, assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St Louis, explained that part of the reason why the Rabbinate might be comfortable with using DNA to confirm Jewishness is because of an existing familiarity with genetic testing in the community to screen for rare genetic conditions. “Because Ashkenazi communities have a history of marrying in, they have this high risk for certain heritable diseases and have established genetic screening programs,” she explained. “So this has made it less fraught and problematic to talk about Jewish genetics in Ashkenazi communities.”In fact, the Orthodox Jewish community is so comfortable with the idea of genetic identity that they have even put together their own international genetic database called Dor Yeshorim, which acts as both a dating service and public health initiative. When two members of the community are being set-up for marriage, Mozersky explained, the matchmaker will check whether or not they are genetically compatible on the DNA database. “This means that the notion of genetics as a part of identity is deeply interwoven in many ways with communal life,” she said.This is something I could identify with. When I was 16 and attending a Jewish day-school in Melbourne, Australia, we had what was called “mouth-swab day”. Everyone in my grade gathered on the basketball courts to provide spit samples that were sent off and screened for Tay-Sachs disease, a rare inherited disorder significantly more common among Ashkenazi Jews that eats away at the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As we waited in line, we joked that this was our punishment for our ancestors marrying their cousins.A few weeks later, after we got the results, I told my grandmother about “mouth-swab day”. I was interested in her thoughts on my newly discovered genetic identity, which seemed to connect me biologically to the world she grew up in, a world of insularity, religiosity, tradition, and trauma.“It’s like I’ve always said,” she declared, after I told her that I wasn’t a carrier of this rare genetic mutation. “It’s important to mix the blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86813740bf7332d8c355f1063039a1187a6a77c3/0_990_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fffacfae382a3e0730a7f118d6d8962","title":"express yourself breast pump revolution ease maternal stress","story":"As hi-tech pumps enter the market, it’s hoped the hassle and difficulty of feeding a small baby will soon be consigned to the pastMost women who have ever had to express breast milk will recognise the facial expressions of the comedian Amy Schumer in the pictures she has put up on her Instagram account in the past few weeks. There she is, hooked up to her double breast pump, looking tired and a bit bored, and at the same time grateful to be sitting down. As you may expect from Schumer’s work, it’s relatable – more so than the proliferation of more glamorous breast pump selfies from celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen, Pink and Kate Upton.At least they are all making milk expressing more mainstream, a momentum that has been building for a while. The actor Rachel McAdams was photographed for a magazine last year accessorising her double breast pump with diamonds and a Versace jacket. The TV series The Good Fight recently showed one of the lawyers expressing in her office and, last September, the model Valeria Garcia walked the catwalk at London fashion week “wearing” a breast pump. Amid the random, but pricey, selection of wares that made up the goodie bags for the nominees at the Oscars earlier this year was a breast pump – perhaps the surest sign yet that expressing milk is coming out of the closet and becoming more visible.In February, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn retweeted a news story about breastfeeding working mothers being forced to express in the toilets, adding “so much more needs to be done to make our workplaces welcoming for new mums”. Which isn’t an unusual or controversial opinion, but the accompanying large photograph of a woman using a double breast pump was an uncommon and arresting sight.Last year, an image went viral of the athlete Sophie Power feeding her three-month-old son on one breast while pumping milk from the other at a rest stop during the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc race. This year, another ultrarunner, Jasmin Paris, stopped along the 268-mile Montane Spine race – which she won, with hours to spare – to express milk for her 14-month-old daughter.I have not expressed breast milk while performing such heroics, although I did once do it in the stinky toilets on a moving Southeastern train. Returning to work five months after the birth of my second baby – and having chosen, and been able, to breastfeed – I am having to reacquaint myself with my breast pump. First time around, I had to express to increase my nonexistent milk supply, and my stubborn wish to breastfeed meant I was trapped in a bovine and mostly miserable cycle of feeding, then pumping with the double-attachment hospital-grade machine I had hired, then feeding again.Once back at work, a less alarming electric pump allowed me to keep breastfeeding (I had soon ditched the manual pump I had tried). My relationship with my Medela pump varies between gratitude and grudge. It has allowed me to continue breastfeeding – and allow other people to take on feeding duties and prevent infections such as mastitis – but the constant sterilising, assembling, transporting, labelling, freezing and defrosting is a hassle.I am lucky in that I work mainly from home, but I have expressed while commuting, in department stores and pub toilets, while driving (not advised) and, once, sobbing in the ladies’ toilets while on a press junket – with painful, solid boobs and a pump that had run out of batteries – hand expressing into the toilet bowl. And yes, I realise how filthy that sounds. Who knows what the other journalists thought I had been doing when I crept into a group interview, late and stained. That was only four years ago but, as a measure of how much more visible milk-expressing has become, this time around I would ask for a proper place and time to do it.The Elvie pump (from the makers of the Elvie kegel trainer) – the one included in the Oscars swag bag – was launched in September last year and the company has raised millions in investment. It already has a strong social media presence, where women share pictures of themselves pumping. The pump is designed to be worn inside your bra, with no wires or tubes and can be controlled by an app on your phone that tells you how you are doing. The maker claims you can pump “at home, at work or on the go”, and even suggests you can “lead the meeting”. Would you want to lead a meeting while a machine drains your breast? I suppose some women might (or might have to). But one of the benefits I have found about breastfeeding, and expressing, is that you get to sit down a lot.I tried the Elvie pump at home, enjoying the novelty of being able to move around and get on with important tasks such as foraging for snacks. It feels modern – I charged it through the USB port on my laptop – but is expensive at £249 for a single pump. It is not as discreet as Elvie claims. Although it is very quiet, when popped inside your bra it creates the appearance of a noticeably giant breast. I synced it to the free app, which means you can control the pump using your phone, and monitored the use in real time: 12 minutes on one side should have produced 30ml of milk. But it turned out to be wrong – it is only supposed to be an estimate, but when decanted into a measuring jug, there was nearly twice that amount (when you are expressing, you become obsessed with every drop because getting it out is such a bore). I regularly started using the pump on train journeys, and once in a restaurant, although I soon gave up on the app. But if you are the sort of Oscar nominee who enjoys being untethered and monitoring bodily functions, I can see its appeal.And if you are the sort of employer who doesn’t feel like giving your new-mother employees the time and space to express milk, I can also see its appeal. I doubt this was the maker’s intention, but it is easy to see how milk-expressing wearables might become an unwelcome solution to the problem of pumping while working.If milk-expressing – that reality for many working women who breastfeed – is becoming more visible, legislation is still to catch up. “The law as it stands is inadequate with respect to what employers are required to do to support breastfeeding mothers returning to work, including those who wish to express at work,” says Paula Chan, a specialist employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon. In the UK, there are no rights to paid breaks or even “a basic legal requirement to provide facilities to enable mothers to express milk”, which should include a private room and somewhere to store milk.“In terms of what employers are required to do, there is a duty to provide a place for breastfeeding mothers to rest, and to carry out a risk assessment of issues, such as working conditions, or risks to the health and safety of the mother or her baby,” says Chan. Employers are also legally required to consider flexible working requests, which a mother might make to accommodate breastfeeding.According to the 2010 Infant Feeding Survey, almost a third of working mothers had returned to work when their babies were between eight and 10 months old – when they are still very much reliant on milk. Just one in five working mothers – and nearly a quarter in Scotland – said that they were given facilities to feed or express at work.The UK, unlike many other European countries, she says, is unusual in not having a statutory right to breastfeeding or expressing breaks. “As a result, women who would like to express milk on their return to work are very much reliant on their employer’s good intentions.”When Caroline went back to work as a supply teacher after her first child was born, she would ask where she could express but, going into different schools every day meant people often forgot about her request. On her first day back, she expressed milk in the cupboard in her classroom, sitting on the floor. Now back at work after her second child turned eight months, Caroline is expressing again. This time, she is working in a school where the teachers are with the children all day, so it’s a case of finding a quiet 10 minutes to go and express when she can. Some days she doesn’t get the chance, which can be uncomfortable. “Apart from the toilets, there aren’t any rooms I can lock,” she says. Instead, she uses an empty room and puts a chair in front of the door to stop children walking in. Has she felt embarrassed about asking where she can express? “Yeah, it feels like an odd thing to do – I think particularly at a school with children around, where I’m sitting in a room with my boobs out.” For many women, expressing is not simply a case of strapping on a pump and getting on with it. Stress will affect the letdown (the reflex that prompts milk to flow) and the amount of milk you can get, says Helen Gray, from the breastfeeding organisation Lactation Consultants of Great Britain. “Feeling private and safe has an effect on your hormone levels. Having a comfortable room and a locked door can make a big difference to mothers who are feeling nervous about having to do this in the workplace.” Ideally, working mothers who are breastfeeding shouldn’t be feeling nervous in the first place. If taboos around breastfeeding have largely been shattered, expressing is still relatively hidden – celebrity selfies and photographs of ultrarunners may help to normalise it, one fluid ounce at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dffc796fe0fecbf7f6b633f68e2b9479b5c78a42/0_161_2829_1697/master/2829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef91552901c30830e9594ed8fa64a55","title":"julian assange sajid javid signs us extradition order","story":"British home secretary says final decision on WikiLeaks founder is ‘now with the courts’The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has revealed he has signed a request for Julian Assange to be extradited to the US where he faces charges of computer hacking.Speaking on the Today Programme on Thursday, Javid said: “He’s rightly behind bars. There’s an extradition request from the US that is before the courts tomorrow but yesterday I signed the extradition order and certified it and that will be going in front of the courts tomorrow.”Javid’s decision opens the way to the court sending the WikiLeaks founder to America. Assange faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Justice Department, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. He is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer.Javid said: “It is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we’ve got a legitimate extradition request, so I’ve signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts.”The 47-year-old Australian was too ill to appear last month at the latest hearing at Westminster magistrates court in relation to the US request.The hearing has been rescheduled for Friday, and depending on Assange’s condition may take place at Belmarsh prison where he is being held.

Assange denies the accusation.Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden.Swedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2017 but reopened it after Ecuador rescinded its offer of asylum to Assange in April this year and allowed British police to arrest him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b4b3b6cd9a972b1cee26ed4c53d0b38fedb36d/0_214_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b88182ccd399273b3fa4c01707ef9307","title":"parental leave uk among least family friendly countries oecd survey","story":"League table compiled based on parental leave and childcare levels puts UK in bottom thirdThe UK is among the least family-friendly of the world’s richest countries, according to a Unicef assessment of policies on child care and parental leave.In a league table based on parental leave for women and men and early years childcare enrolment, the UK comes in the bottom third of countries, well behind France and Germany and the table-toppers Sweden, Norway and Iceland, although ahead of Greece and Switzerland.When only considering parental leave, people in the UK do well compared with parents in Japan, Australia and the US, the last of which offers zero parental leave as a norm.Unicef says family-friendly policies matter because they underpin not only the personal development of children but the establishment of “cohesive societies”.“There is no time more critical to children’s brain development, and therefore their futures, than the earliest years of life,” said Henrietta Fore, Unicef’s executive director. “We need governments to help provide parents with the support they need to create a nurturing environment for their young children. And we need the support and influence of the private sector to make this happen.”But some employers offer better terms and the drinks maker Diageo announced in April that all its 4,500 UK staff would be able to take 26 weeks’ parental leave at full pay as part of a new policy operating in 13 countries.A study in Spain published last month revealed one interesting outcome for men taking increased parental leave: a drop in their desire for more children and longer gaps between children.The researchers found that the men were spending more time with their offspring and possibly investing more in the child they already had as opposed to seeking to have more of them.Unicef’s report says that paid paternity leave helps fathers bond with their babies, contributes to healthy child development and lowers rates of maternal depression. But as a share of all parental leave, the time available for fathers in the UK is among the lowest of those surveyed.“UK working parents and caregivers still face major challenges balancing work and their caregiving responsibilities,” said Liam Sollis, Unicef UK’s head of policy. “While the UK government is taking steps to review and raise awareness of family-friendly policies, take up of shared parental leave, particularly among fathers, remains unacceptably low and much more needs to be done to tackle the financial, cultural and administrative obstacles that many families face.”The study found that parents of young children in the UK were the most likely to cite cost as the reason they did not put children in nurseries more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e117a13c8b6d99744ef3d5a85806f9ad2053146f/114_217_3478_2087/master/3478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bcd4560605ba1cec7f8f7e3e90e7762","title":"virgin media contract sales termination fee","story":"When a Virgin Media salesman called at my home, I told him I was with EE.

So it’s now a question of politics – specifically whether a PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit can command and sustain the confidence of the House of Commons.”Johnson officially launched his campaign on Wednesday saying he believed a new government “with a new mandate, a new optimism, a new determination” could leave the EU with an amended deal by 31 October.However, the leadership frontrunner warned that he was determined to leave the EU by that date, whether he had achieved a new deal or not.“I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome, I don’t think we can end up with any such thing. But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously,” he said.Johnson refused to say what he would do if he had not secured an improved deal in time for 31 October – or whether he would resign if the deadline were not met or no deal was prevented.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Speaking after the defeat in the Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would continue its cross-party efforts to stop no deal.“Labour stands ready to use whatever mechanism it can to protect jobs, the economy and communities from the disastrous consequences of a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “Any Tory leadership candidate should know that parliament will continue to fight against no deal.”Eight Labour MPs including Caroline Flint, John Mann and Graham Stringer voted with the government against the motion and 13 more abstained. Ten Conservative MPs voted with Labour.The debate before the vote revealed fraying tempers in all wings of both parties. The Labour MP Gareth Snell, who represents the leave-voting seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central, said he regretted not voting for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement. He said he would abstain because he could not countenance parliamentary manoeuvres that would lead to a further delay.“We will have been responsible for a no-deal Brexit by default because of our inability to make a decision,” Snell said.The former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he was prepared to resign the Conservative whip and go against the government in a no-confidence vote if it would prevent a no-deal Brexit. “I simply have to say, here and now, I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted,” he said.The motion proposed giving MPs control of the parliamentary agenda in a fortnight’s time. That day could then have been used to begin legislation to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, though it is uncertain what form this would take.Speaking in the debate, Starmer said MPs had been forced to act because of suggestions from leadership candidates including Johnson and Dominic Raab that the UK would leave – come what may – on 31 October. Raab had even suggested he would be prepared to prorogue parliament to stop MPs’ efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit.“It will introduce a safety valve in the Brexit process and it will be a reminder to all Conservative leadership candidates that this house will take every step necessary to prevent a no deal,” Starmer said.The motion, which Labour tabled during an opposition day debate, was signed by the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said it was a “blind motion” that gave no indication as to what path MPs would try to pursue to block a no-deal departure, and would have “virtually unlimited scope”.Tory MPs who said they intended to back the plan included Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach, Sam Gyimah and Jonathan Djanogly, plus Boles, who had flown back to the UK specifically to vote on the motion.MPs working across parties believed it was essential to try to start efforts to halt a no-deal Brexit before the next prime minister was installed and prior to the start of the summer recess. There are no further opposition day debates scheduled.Tory leadership candidates including Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart, who have opposed no deal, had earlier made it clear they would not back the motion.But Hancock told the : “It’s no good just having a Brexit position that is built on either re-running the old plan, which failed or threatening no deal, when parliament has voted in the past already to block no deal. No deal isn’t a policy choice that is available to the next prime minister.”Earlier, Philip Hammond said Johnson’s Brexit plan was impossible as the UK will not be able to leave the EU with a deal or without a deal by the end of October.Hammond cast doubt on the viability of the Brexit promises of Johnson and other Tory leadership contenders as he gave a speech in Westminster.He said many of the candidates were pledging things that they could not deliver. Asked whether Johnson’s plan to leave on 31 October would work, he said: “I don’t think so … I think it’s not sensible for candidates to box themselves into a corner on this. Parliament will not allow a no-deal exit from the EU and our experience has suggested it may not be that easy to secure a deal in parliament.”The idea of leaving with a deal by that date would be “very difficult or impossible”, he said.Leadership contender Jeremy Hunt was also asked about Hammond’s comments and said: “This is a time for skilled negotiation and not empty threats. I’ve always wanted to keep no deal on the table as one of our negotiating levers but we can’t be blind to the fact that there is a strong majority in parliament against no deal and it’s likely that parliament would find a way to block no deal if that was being pursued by the prime minister.“That’s why we need to find a way through this that gets us a deal. And if we want Brexit we need to choose a prime minister who can get us a deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218f77da97ce31653b55f40a885358d25009db20/0_33_1595_957/master/1595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41952addee1ccc2b032c7df39b81359","title":"parliament is out of options to stop no deal brexit tory mp oliver letwin","story":"Senior Tory says new PM can now let UK crash out of EU if no legislation put before MPsA senior Tory MP behind cross-party efforts to block a no-deal Brexit has said parliament has now run out of options for preventing the UK from crashing out of the EU after the defeat of Labour’s motion.Oliver Letwin, a former cabinet minister, was among the signatories to a Labour-led attempt to tie the next prime minister’s hands by ruling out no deal. It was defeated by 11 votes after eight Labour MPs voted with the government and 13 abstained, cancelling out 10 Conservative rebels who voted with Labour.The defeat means parliament has now exhausted the options for preventing a no-deal exit, according to Letwin. “We have run out of all the possibilities that any of us can at the moment think of,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The interviewer Nick Robinson pointed out that MPs could not block a no-deal exit happening by default if no legislation was put before parliament.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place.

Letwin said: “Evidently that’s not something any of us want to do.”He added: “I’m not confident as things stand that the current Labour leadership would know how to solve this crisis either.”Letwin said he was not sure if Boris Johnson, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, was a “no-deal Brexiteer”. He conceded Johnson was “clearly quite likely” to become the next prime minister.The former Conservative MP Nick Boles, who flew back to the UK to vote with Labour on Wednesday, also conceded that opponents of a no-deal departure were fast running out of options, apart from a confidence vote to bring down the government.He said: “No-deal Brexit on 31 October is back to being a racing certainty.

But establishing whether they could be linked to premature deaths is difficult.Research published in the British Medical Journal suggests there is a link between changed eating habits – eating substantially more red meat and processed meat, such as bacon and ham – and a raised risk of dying early. Cutting back and eating more fish, chicken, vegetables and nuts appears to reduce the risk.The study was carried out by a team of researchers in the US and China, looking at the eating habits of about 54,000 women and 28,000 men over eight years and the death rates over the following eight years. All those involved were health professionals in the US in the 1980s and 90s.Every four years, they were asked to fill in a questionnaire which asked them how often they ate different sorts of foods, from “never or less than once per month” to “six or more times a day”. There were more than 14,000 deaths during the study period, which ended in 2010. The leading causes were cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease.The authors acknowledge that they cannot prove that red and processed meat were the causes of death because it is an observational study. Although they allowed for factors such as physical activity, the general quality of diet, smoking and alcohol intake, there may be other things that predisposed the heavy meat eaters to dying earlier.But they write: “A change in protein source or eating healthy plant-based foods such as vegetables or whole grains can improve longevity.”“We are not saying everybody should become vegetarian or vegan,” said the lead author, Frank B Hu of the Harvard TH Chan school of public health in Boston. “However, there is a significant benefit if you replace some of the red meat with plant-based foods.”Exactly what you eat instead of meat is important, he said. “It is not a good idea to cut back and eat more ultraprocessed foods and sugar.”There is a need for policies and strategies to make healthier foods more affordable. “If the healthier alternatives are not accessible and are too expensive, then it is very difficult for people to change their eating patterns,” he said.“The public health impacts could be pretty large, given the prevalent consumption of red and processed meat is quite high especially in western populations.”Some scientists were cautious. Kevin McConway, an emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said it was “a major new study that adds something useful to what was previously known” but that the size of the associations was “not huge”.On average, people were about 60 when the death rate was recorded. In the UK, about five women in 100 will die in the eight years after they are 60 and eight men in 100.It is impossible to be sure that the increased death risk is caused by meat consumption, said McConway. If it were, and if they all ate seven slices of bacon a week more between the ages of 52 and 60, “then about one more of the 100 women would die, and less than that – somewhere between 0 and one – more men would die. So in total somewhere between one and two extra deaths out of the 200 men and women. That’s an increase, but it isn’t immense, and an extra seven slices of bacon a week is quite a substantial change.”“These findings taken together challenge the popular myth that high-protein diets containing lots of red meat are good for health, but support current dietary guidelines that advocate a shift to a Mediterranean-style diet which contains plenty of vegetables, nuts, wholegrain, some fish, poultry and milk but very small amounts of red and processed meat,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c154ef1b40973cef80542acbc9245f6c8b9bc06/0_48_4488_2692/master/4488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296aa499a66a5ca35bf6f0384bd1cc38","title":"chris froome team ineos tour de france cycling","story":"Losing the four-times winner is a blow but it leaves Geraint Thomas as the team’s clear leader for the Tour de FranceTo seal the destiny of the 2019 Tour de France, the organisers have devised a final week with some of the toughest climbing ever seen in the race’s history. It is highly likely, however, that the defining moment may turn out to be Chris Froome’s horrendous accident on Wednesday while warming up for a time trial, which has stymied his attempt to win a fifth Tour before he even glimpsed the starting blocks.That is not to belittle Froome’s erstwhile fellow competitors, least of all the defending champion, Geraint Thomas. A multiple Tour winner is a key reference point in every Tour he rides, who weighs heavily on the racing each day, even when, as last year, a teammate ends up heading seamlessly for the win.A Tour without Froome will resemble the 1983 race, when Bernard Hinault was ruled out by tendinitis, or the 1976 race, when Eddy Merckx was sidelined by a saddle boil, or 1997, when Miguel Indurain was absent for the first time in a dozen years. A Tour without Froome for the first time since 2012 will be different. Not better, not worse, just different.Team Sky’s catenaccio style of clamping down the racing has not pleased everyone and the squad’s PR has been disastrous at times but Froome’s consummate determination and no holds barred style have forged some memorable moments: most notably in 2016, when in the space of a few days he could be seen first flying down the Col de Peyresourde in a dramatic crouch, then fighting crosswinds in the Midi with Thomas and Peter Sagan, and finally running up Mont Ventoux after breaking his bike.The leader of what are now Team Ineos has been here before he is not nicknamed “Crash” Froome for nothing. Last year his Tour was doomed from the start by a minor get-down in the first stage.His 2014 attempt at retaining the title was wrecked by a fall in northern France in the rain, the only time in seven attempts he has not finished the race. A 2015 bid for the Vuelta a España was shelved when he crashed in Andorra. Even by the standards of a sport where everyone falls off at some time, and the only question is about the severity of the prang, Dave Brailsford’s proteges seem to fall off their bikes more than most.Thomas, who will take over from Froome as the team’s Tour leader, has been even more unfortunate over the years, although he denies being accident prone.There have been other heavy non-racing crashes for Ineos riders already this year: Ben Swift’s fall while training in Tenerife, which ruined his early season, and the crash in Colombia that put Egan Bernal out of the Giro d’Italia. But Froome is now 34 this year he was bidding to become the fourth oldest Tour winner in history. Given his age, this crash may mean he ends his career stuck on a spectacular but nonetheless frustrating four Tours.As to where this leaves his team, one of Brailsford’s catchy phrases is “mission clarity”, which the former GB cycling performance director views as a prerequisite when trying to land a major target. No one would have wished for the decision to be made this way but racing without Froome will remove the question that has been lurking since the Welshman triumphed last year: which of the two Tour winners would be leader this time?Starting with two leaders in form, one going for the record fifth win and the other desperate to prove he is not a one-Tour wonder, had the potential to become tricky, no matter how ardent the protestations of mutual regard, affection and support. As Thomas described in his autobiography, at times Team Sky’s management struggled to come to terms with his new-found status even as he rode to victory last year.As it stands, Brailsford and co can reflect that while they are appallingly unlucky to lose Froome in this way, what seemed like another piece of dire misfortune – Bernal’s crash on 4 May – may have had a silver lining in the medium term. At least that has ensured that, even with Froome sidelined, Thomas will go to the Tour with one of the finest prospects in cycling to support him.For Froome this will be a bitter blow and all cycling will wish him fair wind for a speedy recovery, perhaps this September in time to bid for a second Vuelta win or victory at the world championships in Yorkshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61c3ea9db4dd6e967b1f83375e5e38ae14380505/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d66a054f113cc82be6c84fa9dcfd6ec","title":"india v new zealand cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"The heavy rain has stopped.

We might here here until 9pm, but I reckon we’re getting on.Official update from the ICC in the press box: “if there is no further rain, the umpires will inspect the pitch at 10:30am.” As we received that news there was a roar around Trent Bridge from the Indian faithful as the hovercraft was removed. It reveals a nice, fresh pitch. Delicious. “Are you allowed to comment on the ICC’s disgraceful slapping down of Michael Holding?” asks Gary Naylor on the tweet. (In fact, that’s one of those questions that requires no answer - its mere stating is enough to tell us all we need to know).A terrible time for that story to drop after two days had been rained out, becoming the talk of the tournament. I mostly loved Mikey’s line about whether he should simply go home rather than heading to the next game. It reminded me of an answer Ian Chappell gave Geoff and me when interviewing him recently, in relation to the time he was told what he couldcouldn’t say on air by the BCCI.Okay, I’m upstairs in my seat. That’s a start. It’s also a start that the main covers have been removed across the square. The hovercraft is still siting over the main strip, but we’re heading in the right direction. The toss is scheduled for 10am local time, which seems destined to be delayed. We’ll see shortly. Will there be cricket? When I arrived here last night in the motor home that took me from Taunton to Nottingham, we didn’t think so. It was torrential. It was biblical. It was not fit for the sport we love. However, despite mizzle and drizzle and all the rest over the last couple of hours, it hasn’t poured. There’s a gentle breeze running across Trent Bridge. We’re a chance. Probably not at the scheduled starting time of 10:30am, but provided this break of sorts in the weather continues, I think we’re a big hope of getting on. At a modern ground like Trent Bridge, perhaps sooner than might be the case if we were at a non-Test venue. With expectations so cruelly built up like that, I’m sure it’ll bucket down as soon as I hit send. But if we don’t, both teams have a big opportunity to take advantage of the washouts from earlier in the week by claiming two points and remaining undefeated. Whoever does might already have a couple of toes into the final four. In Blackcaps land, they’re fit and firing. Tim Southee - the Lennon to Trent Boult’s McCartney in the swing stakes - is fit and available. They’d be made not to pick both of them on a morning like this. Alongside Lockie Ferguson - the quickest bowler in the World Cup so far - and Matt Henry, that’s quite the quartet. India boast similar selection riches. Well, with the ball at least. They are, however, missing Shikhar Dhawan with a thumb injury for a couple of games, which he acquired when stroking a gorgeous ton against Australia on Sunday. The margin of victory there (36 runs) should have been a lot greater. They thrashed them, really.Whichever way it all plays out, rest assured that the OBO will be here to keep you company. If they do get on, let’s hope for a game half as captivating as yesterday. Given I’m currently writing this sitting on the ground in the Trent Bridge car park (long story accreditation, urgh!) I’ll just be a few minutes getting my act together and popping upstairs. But don’t delay: drop me a line. Tweet me. Good morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef245287ecc345f2934ce613f9f487507cde8cf5/0_446_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7073c9a56cf16e5d99763f05932114","title":"step up women dance female choreographers","story":"Their moves are fresh, funny and stylish their subjects include the climate crisis, gender politics and poetry. These electrifying choreographers are on the riseA Peter and the Wolf where Peter is a girl, the animals dress in streetwear and the pastoral setting becomes an urban playground: this is the world according to Ruth Brill. The 30-year-old has just made her second main-stage work for Birmingham Royal Ballet, the company she has danced with since 2012, and is now retiring as a dancer to concentrate on choreography.Brill’s work has a sense of fun, fantasy and solid classical grounding. Her last piece, Arcadia, had nymphs and gods cavorting in the woods. In Peter and the Wolf – Prokofiev’s much-loved children’s piece, narrated here by poet Hollie McNish – the duck may be a hormonal teen in headphones, and the dancers wearing a mix of pointe shoes and trainers, but the steps are still steeped in classical tradition, just with character-driven inflections, ersions and quirks.Seeking to connect with her audience, Brill has made dance for the Rugby World Cup and Birmingham flash mobs. Her next projects include working with London Children’s Ballet, New English Ballet Theatre and National Youth Ballet. “Now is when my generation needs to step up and prepare to become the next wave of leaders,” Brill said recently. “We have different life experiences, different stories to tell. And it’s time to push ourselves forward to inherit roles from the generation before us.”With her bleach-blond bob, Charlotte Edmonds looks the epitome of cool, and you could say the same about the 22-year-old’s dance. Plucked out of the Rambert school to become the Royal Ballet’s first Young Choreographer, Edmonds impressed everyone during a three-year association with Covent Garden, where she was mentored by Wayne McGregor, made choreography for Selfridges, a film for the National Gallery and a ballet with basketball that was inspired by the legendary choreographer Kenneth MacMillan.Since going freelance, she’s made an underwater ballet about depression, featuring ballerina Francesca Hayward, and is keen to work more in digital platforms. She is doing post-production on a film she has directed about plastic pollution, is making a documentary series about dyslexia (a condition she has herself) and is working on a ballet about the climate crisis.These might be serious subjects, but Edmonds is more and more drawn to fizzy, pop-culture-inspired choreography, closing the gap between the ballet stage and the dancefloor, such as a funky solo she made for the Royal Ballet’s Joseph Sissens and a new piece set to the music of Hot Chip.A go-to choreographer for big ballet companies looking to make relevant work for their younger dancers, Edmonds has no fewer than three different works being performed at the forthcoming Young Talent festival, by the junior companies of Dutch National Ballet and Norwegian National Ballet, and the Rambert school.Belgian dancer Stina Quagebeur has been choreographing since she was inspired as a child by the ballets of Mats Ek and Maurice Béjart. She’s kept it up as a sideline throughout her career as a dancer with English National Ballet. At 34, she is making her mark as a dance-maker with a strong sense of her own voice.ENB director Tamara Rojo has put her faith in Quagebeur and gave her a main stage debut as part of the company’s She Persisted show, highlighting female choreographers. In Nora, based on Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, Quagebeur showed her interest in emotionally driven narrative, and stripped-back literary adaptations – a territory pretty much owned by Cathy Marston at the moment. She created surging, spinning and circling movement, with the performers’ feet just skimming the floor, using a group of dancers as a chorus to amplify Nora’s thoughts and emotional state.This is a choreographer interested in her characters’ psychology. Previous themes have included Edward Hopper’s love-hate marriage (A Room in New York), Vera Brittain’s Testament of Youth (Vera) and Philip Larkin’s poetry (Domna). A keen theatregoer, who particularly admires director Emma Rice, Quagebeur is interested in reimagining stories and the ways you might tell them. We’ll be watching her next moves with interest.Another dancer turned choreographer nurtured within a company’s ranks, Sophie Laplane follows 13 years as a dancer with Scottish Ballet by becoming its artist in residence. About to turn 35, the Frenchwoman, who trained at the Paris Opera Ballet school, made her first one-act commission, Sibilo, in 2016.Sibilo is sophisticated, classy choreography but has humour, too – molten duets, staccato gestures, elastic torsos and shimmying six-packs. Her piece Click!, for Ballet Black, saw the dancers in acid-bright suits, pointe shoes and shoulder pads, and the rhythm pinging through their bodies with some serious groove. It seemed as if it could take ballet in a fresh direction.Laplane has experimented with film and 360-degree video. Her work Maze was adapted into a short film shot in a derelict swimming pool in Glasgow, all gitchy electro music and jerky bodies, looking like two long-legged birds courting. Her latest piece, Dextera, was created to mark Scottish Ballet’s 50th anniversary, and tackles gender politics with wit and cheek (to the sound of Mozart). She has also worked with New York City Ballet’s Choreographic Institute, is creating a new piece in the space of one week for Scottish Ballet’s Digital Season (it can be viewed on the company’s Facebook feed), and is about to graduate with an MA in choreography – not that Laplane needs a certificate to prove her credentials.Rambert-trained Arielle Smith has had one of the best starts you can imagine, landing a gig as young associate choreographer with Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures company, working alongside Bourne on his new production of Romeo and Juliet.The Havana-born, British-raised 22-year-old created several pieces at the National Youth Ballet and has now set up her own company, with some excellent younger dancers.Smith enjoys making abstract mass movement, as in the piece Storm, which she created while still at school. But she’s most interested in making dance that explores being human, not just dancing for dancing’s sake. Her short piece Lots of Varied Expectations addresses that old favourite, love, against a warm and whimsical backdrop of 1940s songs, with movement that is fun and quirky, and with playful use of rhythm, but always with an underlying emotion. Smith is expanding the piece into a full-length work and plans a national tour next year.“Arielle’s a wonder,” says Bourne. “I really liked the choreography she’s done for National Youth Ballet. It stood out as being very contemporary, very different. She’s very mature for her age. We laugh a lot. I think she’s got a great future.”• Romeo and Juliet is on tour until 12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82a8ac8f4fcd7b7afc64aa9ecbb8801","title":"seven ways to make windows 10 work better","story":"FlintyMcQwerty asked for tips to fix or avoid problems with the operating systemPlease share all your favourite tips, tricks and techniques for harnessing the power, panache and pulchritude of Windows 10. (Apologies, Jack, for my ineluctable tendency to alliterate.) FlintyMcQwertyLast week’s answer provoked a lot of discussion about Windows 10. I can’t do anything about the more hysterical complaints but many issues can be resolved by spending a few minutes in the settings app. I’m therefore accepting FlintyMcQwerty’s invitation to explain a few of them.The one thing you have to accept is that Windows 10, like Windows 8, has two applications programming interfaces, and both are required to meet the needs of a changing world. There’s an old API for traditional programs run with a mouse, and a new one for finger-friendly apps that work on touchscreen tablets and convertibles.Tens of millions of us are already using Windows 10 devices with touchscreens and we may well become the majority. However, “modern” apps are now opened, resized and closed in exactly the same way as traditional programs and they work perfectly well with mice, so why complain about them? It’s not a fundamental change like the one from character-based MS-DOS to graphical Windows.In fact, anyone who learned how to use Windows 95 when it came out should have no problem running Windows 10 today. The basic elements of a Start menu, a taskbar and clickable icons haven’t changed, even if the implementations look a little different.The quickest and easiest way to run programs in Windows 10 is to pin them to the taskbar, where they are very visible and only a click away. You should have at least nine of your most-used programs pinned because you can run them by pressing the shortcut combination of the Windows Key plus a number. WinKey-5 will run the fifth program in the line with no need to switch to the mouse. Keep the order the same and you’ll soon learn which is which.There are other ways to run programs you don’t use very often. The hallowed method is to put their icons on the desktop. The modern alternative is to pin the program’s icon to the Start menu, creating a Live Tile, which is mainly an icon in a box. The advantages are that it’s bigger and much easier to hit it’s not cluttering up your desktop and it’s not buried at the bottom of a long menu.Remove all the tiles you don’t want (right-click and select “unpin from Start”), resize the panel and group the tiles you need at the top. After that, you can run programs quickly by hitting the Windows key to open the Start menu, then clicking a tile. This is much easier than scrolling down the Start menu, especially when many programs are in sub-menus.One reader missed the “jump list”, which provided Start menu access to recently used files in Windows 7. They have not gone away. First, you get a jump list of recently used files by right-clicking an icon on the taskbar. Second, there’s a list of 20 recently used files in the “quick access” panel in file explorer. Third, the new task view provides access to the hundreds you may have used over the past few days.If your file explorer shows default folders such as documents and pictures, you can scroll up to find the “quick access” section, which has bookmarks for files and folders. If you want to get to a folder very quickly, right-click it and select “pin to quick access” to bookmark it. (Another option is “pin to Start”.)To change the default setting, open file explorer, go to the view tab, and click the down-arrow, under options on the far right. Next, select “change folder and search options” from the drop-down menu. The top line of the resulting panel says “open file explorer to:”, and you can choose either “this PC” or “quick access”.There’s an even easier way to return to something you were doing earlier: click its thumbnail image in Windows 10’s task view, aka timeline. You can call up the task view by clicking its white icon, which is next to the search box on the taskbar, or by pressing WinKey+Tab.Task view saves time-stamped thumbnails of files you have used recently. It’s usually easier to recognise and click a thumbnail than to pick a file name from a text menu.Scroll to the bottom of the task view for the option to store up to 30 days of activity online, rather than on your PC. This also lets you continue an activity on a different device. However, it may involve a loss of privacy, even if only Microsoft’s AI reads your data to make suggestions.To clear or manage your data, go to the privacy section of the settings (cogwheel) app and click “activity history”. This page has tick boxes for “store my activity history on this device” and “send my activity history to Microsoft”.Task view also lets you have multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10, simply by clicking “new desktop”. You can set up different desktops for different scenarios: one for work, one for email and one for social networking, for example. You can move rapidly between desktops by holding down Ctrl-WinKey and pressing a left or right arrow key, rather than going back to task view.Every virtual desktop has the same taskbar, icons and wallpaper but it’s cheaper than buying three or four monitors.Everybody uses a clipboard to copy something from one application and paste it into something else, usually by using Ctrl-C (copy) and Ctrl-V (paste). Windows 10’s clipboard has the option to store its history in the cloud. Now you can re-paste items you copied earlier, pin items you paste often, and copy things on one device and paste them on a different device. As with task view, there are privacy implications. However, you can control what’s allowed and clear your clipboard data from the clipboard page in the “system” section of the settings app.The cloud clipboard uses WinKey-V to paste, instead of Ctrl-V. Sadly, it doesn’t have the “smart paste” features that you get with Ctrl-Alt-V in Microsoft Word.You can have lots of different windows from different applications on screen at the same time but only one of them is “active”. However, it’s really useful to be able to scroll texts in background windows without having to click in them to make them active. To turn this feature on, go to the devices section in the settings app and open the mouse page. The last item is “scroll inactive windows when I hover over them”. Simply set the switch to on.Notifications are interruptions and Windows 10 makes it easy to avoid most of them. Go to the system section of the settings app and select the “notifications \u0026amp actions” page. You can turn off “the Windows welcome experience after updates” and Microsoft’s “tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows”. You can also go through all the apps that can send notifications and turn off the ones you don’t want to hear from, including “suggested”. Clicking an app’s icon provides fine tuning. You can allow text but turn off sounds, for example.You can also eliminate more suggestions from the personalisation section. Go to the lock-screen page to turn off “get fun facts, tips, and more from Windows and Cortana on your lock screen”. Go to the Start page to turn off “show suggestions occasionally in Start”.Also, if you don’t have Microsoft Office installed, it may be suggested. Do you have a program called Get Office in Your Start Menu? If so, you can right-click it and select “uninstall”.Maybe at least one of these tips will save you from getting stressed about something you can fix.

It crosses the Kintyre peninsula, saving boats from the long and occasionally dangerous trip around the Mull of Kintyre, and the prospect of dicing with the Corryvreckan whirlpool. The canal is nine miles long, cutting across country from Ardrishaig in the east to Crinan in the west. The towpath is in great condition, making for easy cycling or walking. The Crinan Hotel is a great place to end up, and a bowl of seafood stew outside its bar, looking out to Islay and Jura makes an unforgettable lunch. • scottishcanalsMichael MooneyOn this 15-mile walk you’ll see alternative living on London canals, friendly folks, parks and, most importantly, lots of pubs! Start at The Grapes, close to Limehouse Basin Marina, wander for a mile and half up the Regent’s Canal to the Palm Tree at Mile End, then east along the Hertford Union for a mile or so to the Crate Brewery at Hackney Wick. Stop there for lots of great bars and pizza or carry on a short way up the River Lea to the Four Quarters . Then comes the Princess of Wales in Clapton and, on past Tottenham Marshes for six miles is Camden Town Brewery in Enfield (nearest station Ponders End), on a reservoir. Get chatting to people on passing boats and maybe get a ride. A very good escape for any Londoner and a brilliant alternative for tourists.RachaelThe Wye in Derbyshire passes through one of the loveliest valleys in England and offers many brilliant routes. The most dramatic stretch, possibly the closest we have to a rainforest in this country, is Chee Dale. It’s not an easy route, with some scrambling over rocks and places where the valley is so narrow you need to use stepping stones alongside the river – and it’s impassable after heavy rain. Wyedale or Topley Pike car parks are good starting points (there are also buses the 65 and 66 from Buxton pass by Topley Pike), and the riverside Angler’s Rest at Miller’s Dale is a beautifully located refreshment stop. For a simpler route back to the start, follow the Monsal Trail above the river and through tunnels, passing lots of interesting industrial relics. About five miles in total.• walkpeakdistrictGraham DeanEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The route is named after the Templer family, who built a tramway and the Stover Canal to carry granite off the moors to the port. The final stage (of six miles) takes walkers from Newton Abbot Town Quay via Coombe Cellars along the River Teign Estuary to Shaldon. Once in the village, you can pick up the passenger ferry to Teignmouth and enjoy the sunset over Dartmoor from the back beach. This section along the river is dependent on the tide. The estuary shore is full of interest, with a shellfish farm, an old lime kiln and lots of watercraft.• walkingenglishmanLaura MLeaving Chichester station, head out of town along the quiet old ship canal. Mostly just moorhens for company and the sky reflecting off the glassy silent waterway. Crossing a road, skirt around the marina and walk on, past (or into) the lovely Ship pub at Itchenor. Then the route runs all along the natural beauty that is Chichester harbour to the vast sandy beaches of the Witterings. Eight miles of bliss.• my.viewrangerMark EbdnFor an eight-mile river walk with everything, head for the Tees. Start at Bowlees visitor centre, erting briefly north along Bow Lee Beck to check out Gibson’s Cave and Summerhill Force waterfall. Cross the Tees at Newbiggin and have lunch at the Strathmore Arms in Holwick, the sort of cosy, hidden pub you thought no longer existed. Cross boggy moorland including two sets of stepping stones to a viewpoint looking down the Tees (ignore the quarry). You’re soon right beside the river and ready for the grand finale: the thundering High Force then Low Force with a suspension bridge used by Victorian lead miners to finish.• my.viewrangerPaul KirkwoodThe three- to four-mile walk between Pontymoile and Abergavenny runs through glorious countryside into the setting for Alexander Cordell’s 19th-century family sagas. There are no roads, just wonderful countryside with the odd barge or cruiser puttering alongside you. There’s the Green Flute Café at Goytre Wharf, and several pubs within a short walk of the canal. This walk ends near Llanfoist with a 20-minute walk into Abergavenny. Stay at the Angel Hotel (doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB), or just relax in the hotel’s bar with a pint and take the frequent bus service back to Pontymoile. Another great walk on the canal is the seven-mile stretch further north between Talybont-on-Usk and Brecon again, return by bus.GwynThis is a six-mile walk along the glorious River Wharfe from Ilkley to Bolton Abbey with views of the Yorkshire dales. Start at Ilkley’s Riverside Gardens on the south bank near the remains of a Roman fort. Follow the path west past the old stone bridge and along to attractive Addingham with its Low Mill weir and views of Castleberg fort. Continue to the 12th-century monastery of Bolton Abbey, which stands amid wonderful woods and parkland. There are lots of picnic spots here and the brave will want to try crossing the Wharfe via the 60 stepping stones once used by lay workers at the Priory. • gps-routesKevinIt’s 11 miles and an easy four-hour walk from Belfast to Lisburn along the 18th-century Lagan Navigation towpath. Begin in central Belfast at the Waterfront Hall. Your journey transitions from an industrial landscape of streets tightly packed with terraced houses into the woodland and wet meadows of open country. The joggers and cyclists who’ve been keeping you company thin out once you pass picturesque Shaws Bridge and from here you’ll have the towpath to yourself. Take a brief detour to explore the mysterious megalithic tomb at the Giant’s Ring and perhaps the pretty village of Edenderry before continuing to Lisburn. Turn right at Lagan Island for the railway station and catch a train back to Belfast.• walkniJohn McLavertyYou can feel the energy and power of the Industrial Revolution as you tread the towpath along the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. Leaving Birmingham’s city centre, the red-brick factories and sturdy bridges are evidence of the importance and history of the UK’s waterways. About half way along the 27-mile walk – if you’re going all the way to Worcester – the rolling hills and sweet pastures of rural England take over. Ask lock-keepers and boaters for good pubs – my favourite is the Weighbridge in the pretty village of Alvechurch south of Birmingham, right on the canal with a beer garden offering views of passing boats, barges and walkers.Alex HughesLooking for a holiday with a difference?

The presidential candidate has made jogging part of his election toolkit, from his campaign against the decidedly less athletic Ted Cruz, to repeated 5km jaunts across Iowa as he bids for the 2020 Democratic nomination.Wednesday morning saw O’Rourke’s latest display of physical prowess, as the former Texas congressman popped up in New York to run two miles with LGBTQ activists. O’Rourke is due shortly to launch a series of policies to protect gay rights.O’Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries.“Everybody ready to run?” O’Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. “Two miles is all we’re doing,” he added, which served to lift spirits a little.With that, O’Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs.Paul Humphries was dressed more traditionally, in shorts and a rainbow-emblazoned Beto for Senate T-shirt, although confessed he was not much of a trackman.“I am a runner, although not a very good one,” he said. Humphries is originally from Texas and has been living in New York for the past 15 years. Despite the Beto T-shirt, he is yet to choose a candidate to support. “It’s too early to say,” he said. “I’m still open. But I think Beto’s an important part of the conversation we’re having.”The O’Rourke campaign said the run was “in honor of Pride month”, and coincided with the unveiling of several LGBTQ-focused policies. As president, O’Rourke would take executive action to reverse Donald Trump’s ban on trans people in the military, his team said, and would create a universal healthcare system “with explicit protections against discrimination”.O’Rourke said: “Too many LGBTQ+ people still lack protection under many states’ laws and the current administration is encouraging rather than stamping out discrimination. We must ensure all Americans are treated equally no matter who they are or who they love.”O’Rourke has been criticized for an early lack of specific policy ideas – and a perceived sense of entitlement – but the Human Rights Campaign, in endorsing O’Rourke for the Senate in 2018, described him as a “proven champion of equality”. Runner Nora Moore said: “He’s an ally of so many marginalized communities and I think he walks the walk and I find that inspirational in a politician.”Moore, 36, was running with a stroller containing her four-year-old daughter Fiona. She said she has trained for two half-marathons in this fashion, and showed no signs of fatigue as the runners headed towards the finish. O’Rourke is Moore’s choice for the nomination “as of right now” she has been volunteering for his campaign in New York.She said: “I’m one of those complicit iniduals who sort of was asleep at the wheel a little bit, thought everything was great, assumed my girl Hillary was going to win, and then when it didn’t happen I just got really invested in being more involved.”Despite that, O’Rourke was defiant when the  asked about his drooping numbers.“There’s no poll taken in June the year before a presidential election that accurately predicted the outcome,” he said. He pointed to low polling numbers during his Texas Senate race.“We cannot allow polls to determine our chances. Nor as president will I allow polls to determine what we focus on. We’ll do what is right for the right reasons, regardless of the political consequences.”As for the run, O’Rourke showed no sign of tiring, unlike the .

We want your toes,’” Griffiths told the . “I thought it was a bit of a joke, really.”It was not. For more than 40 years, visitors have flocked to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City for a chance to try the country’s most famous drink: the Sourtoe Cocktail.The beverage consists of a mummified human toe floating in a whiskey shot patrons must let the digit – or its blackened nail – touch their lips in order to receive a certificate and qualify for admittance to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.Upon returning home to Bolton, Griffiths learned he would lose three of his toes to the frostbite. He asked the surgeon to keep them.During his recovery, he began corresponding with the Downtown Hotel about possibly donating the digits, but his physical rehabilitation and work hours complicated plans to travel to Yukon.Months passed and Griffiths kept his toes in jars “just in my bedside drawer”. Finally, after much back and forth with the hotel, he suggested simply mailing them to Canada.At the post office, he panicked after being asked what was in the polythene envelope.“I couldn’t think of anything. I didn’t want to just blatantly lie and say it was a candle or whatever.” He told the postal clerk he was mailing his toes – and wrote “Novelty gift” on the envelope.He kept one of the toes as “insurance” because, he said: “I’m not sure really you should be posting toes.”More than a month later, the toes arrived in Dawson City. “We couldn’t be happier to receive a new toe. They are very hard to come by these days,” said the hotel in a statement.Terry Lee, the hotel’s “toe expert” will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey.“The big toe is the money toe,” Lee told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.“We usually don’t get frostbitten toes. Usually, they’re from gout or diabetes, or they’re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents … to get a frostbitten toe, that’s phenomenal.” There are currently three toes in use.In recent years, the hotel has grappled with a spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of C$2,500 (£1,500).The establishment is not trying to convince Griffiths to make the trip to the Yukon to try the cocktail. He is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first.“People look at you as though you’re a bit mad, he said. “But I think it’s a nice little bit of fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5723a3a60059e69201d6ed439c3f5e7c439b82f9/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78428677bd4ba3e50819eb05968bf0ff","title":"guatemala election corruption creeps in again four years after uprising","story":"Backlash against anti-corruption efforts will have real consequences as Guatemala heads to the polls on SundayAs day broke over Guatemala’s national palace on 3 September 2015, Gabriel Wer celebrated what promised to be a new dawn for Guatemala.The president, former civil war general Otto Pérez Molina, had – along with most of his government – been forced to resign by an unprecedented wave of weekly anti-corruption protests that morphed into a popular uprising.“We did it – the people did it – and it felt like a new start,” said Wer, 37, co-founder of the #JusticiaYa (JusticeNow) movement which spearheaded the demonstrations. “We knew the whole system had to change – not just a few politicians. But honestly, it felt like we’d started the Central American spring.”Four years on, as Guatemala heads to the polls to elect a new president, vice-president, 158 congress members and 340 mayors, fears are growing that winter is coming.Crucial reforms to clean up the country’s politics and justice system have been thwarted by Congress and courts in a coordinated pushback plotted from the military-run Mariscal prison where elite crime bosses including Pérez Molina are detained.The fightback has been fronted by current president, Jimmy Morales, a former blackface comedian who capitalised on widespread public disillusionment to win the 2015 elections under the slogan “not corrupt, nor a thief”.At first, Morales backed the UN-backed investigatory body which had provided the evidence of Molina’s crimes. Over the past decade, the Commission against Impunity (CICIG) has helped local prosecutors bring charges against 680 people including four presidents, military officers, judges, drug traffickers and powerful entrepreneurs.Key figures in a massive customs fraud case – the trigger for the 2015 protests – gave evidence revealing how powerful crime networks that emerged during the 1960-1996 civil war had spread throughout state institutions.CICIG was hailed as a model for other countries in the region, but as investigators shifted their focus to Morales, his family and his political allies, the president turned on the commission.Morales has faced three impeachment votes – two linked to illegal campaign financing. In response, he sanctioned the end of CICIG – in direct disobedience of the country’s highest court – and, banished its commissioner, Ivan Velásquez, claiming the veteran Colombian crime fighter threatened national security.“Illegal political funding is one of the biggest obstacles in Guatemala to building a functioning democracy – and that’s why our achievements in exposing the ‘original sin’ generated such a big reaction against us,” Velásquez told the .“Our goal was to investigate the 2019 elections in real time to make them the most transparent yet, but we’ve been unable to do so because of our reduced investigative capacity and the decision to end our mandate,” said Velásquez.The campaign against CICIG was also waged in Washington DC. Guatemalan business leaders and politicians lobbied Republican lawmakers, making dubious claims that the commission was under Russian influence and undermining investment. In May 2018, Marco Rubio, chair of the western hemisphere committee, temporarily suspended US funds to CICIG.And when Morales announced the end of the commission, the US was silent.“Trump betrayed 10 years of unprecedented progress, and sided with the old alliance of politicians, military officers, judges, businessmen and organised crime who don’t care about democracy, poverty or justice, only about maintaining their privileges,” said Martin Rodriguez, editor of the news website Nomada. “It’s a selfish, colonial decision which will result in more Guatemalans at the US border.”Under Morales, Guatemala’s tax revenue has plunged, child malnutrition rates are up, and – in a throwback to the country’s cold war past – policing has been re-militarized.With the rule of law once more under attack, more and more Guatemalans are deciding to flee – and most of them are heading north.More than 470,000 Guatemalans have been apprehended at the US border since Morales took power in 2016 – twice the number during the previous government.Campaigners fear that an election with minimal oversight will further entrench criminal interests in the state, fueling more crime, corruption, poverty – and forced migration.Numerous candidates are alleged to have links to organized crime: in April, presidential candidate Marco Estrada was arrested in Miami on charges of conspiring with the Sinaloa cartel. Prosecutors allege that Estrada offered the cartel his support in exchange for millions of dollars of campaign funding – and the assassination of rival candidate Thelma Aldana.Aldana, a former attorney general and CICIG collaborator was leading the polls, but was expelled from the race when corruption charges were lodged the day before her candidacy was authorized.In contrast, charges against former first lady Sandra Torres – including criminal association and illegal election financing – were delayed for months until they were eventually presented the day after she was authorized as a candidate – and thus granted immunity from prosecution. Torres currently leads the polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92290ee107330add4cdb94abc658b22d6b2618ed/0_168_3677_2206/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753db7a8838f52317625aaf9b14bb44f","title":"hungary eyes science research as latest target for state control","story":"Academy will be managed by nationalist government in unprecedented moveThe Hungarian government is moving to bring the country’s umbrella scientific research organisation under its control, in what scientists in the country and globally say would be an unprecedented assault on academic freedoms.The far-right, anti-migration government of Viktor Orbán has sought to increase its control over numerous sectors of society since it came into office in 2010, including putting financial pressure on independent media outlets, harassing and taxing NGOs that work on issues such as migration, and moving to centralise historical research.Most notably, the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, is being forced to move some of its operations to Vienna after a long battle with the government.The country’s Academy of Sciences appears to be the latest target for increased state control. The academy consists of a society of distinguished scientists and intellectuals, alongside a broad research network of 15 institutes and 150 research groups comprising about 3,000 scientific researchers.The government’s plan would separate these institutes from the main academy, and create a governing board in which government-appointed delegates would have a majority. Parliament, which is dominated by Orbán’s Fidesz party, is currently debating the bill. It is expected to be passed and come into force by 1 September.Hungarian government officials say it is reasonable for the government to have a say in how state funding is used.“The academy of sciences is a sovereign institution, but not independent from national interests,” said the foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, at a conference in Bratislava last week. “It’s obvious that they should make research in areas and directions which are important from the perspective of the future competitiveness of the country.”Scientists at the academy, however, believe the move is punishment for criticism of the Orbán government made by social science researchers.“We were never afraid to criticise the government if research showed policies that were problematic,” said Emese Szilágyi, who coordinates an institute representing researchers at the academy. “The illiberal government here has reorganised many sectors already and it’s clear that this attack against the academy fits into a chain of events.”She said the vast majority of academy employees were against the plan and said they would use “every available option” to try to stop it from taking effect.László Palkovics, Hungary’s minister for trade and industry, has previously criticised the academy for straying into politics. “Their job is to give scientific advice and recommendations,” he said in an interview with a pro-government web portal last year. “In some cases the academy has moved towards being politically active and this is not their task.”László Lovász, a mathematician and the president of the academy, said there was a misunderstanding about the role of social sciences among government figures, and said criticism was legitimate if evidence-based research ended up suggesting government policy was flawed.“Research in sociology, economics, political science, can have criticism concerning certain policies, and I think it’s reasonable for the government to listen to this criticism. That is different from politics where you try to change the government,” he said at a press conference held at the academy’s grand building in central Budapest on Wednesday.Lovász said while social sciences could be the most affected by the plan, natural science could also suffer, and the shakeup would make long-term research projects and “any research beyond government priorities increasingly difficult to follow”.He said trust had been eroded by the aggressive and “improper” way in which the government had conducted negotiations with the academy. He said the initial decision to reorganise the academy’s finances was communicated by email a year ago, and the academy was given just 54 minutes in which to respond.Antonio Loprieno, the president of the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, said it was acceptable for a government to set broad parameters for research spending, but the Hungarian law was clearly aimed at giving the government “an inappropriate level of detail” in control over research.Loprieno said the Hungarian government’s moves were unprecedented in an EU country and a worrying sign of what might be tried by governments elsewhere. “So far we are not seeing it anywhere else, but it could happen in countries that are moving towards populist governments, where there is a disregard for science, and universities and scientific institutes could become targets,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7956c054365da09c795f9e26001f7a25e0fb433/0_1_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509cadcd5b38638396a61d575481b345","title":"mexico carolina herrera fashion designer cultural appropriation","story":"Does Carolina Herrera’s Resort 2020 line evoke ‘the playful and colourful mood of a Latin holiday’ or rip off indigenous designs? Three months after calling on Spain to apologise for its colonial abuses, the Mexican government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador has found a more contemporary and cultural bone to pick.The country’s culture minister, Alejandra Frausto, has written to the Venezuelan fashion designer Carolina Herrera to demand an explanation for her company’s use of indigenous Mexican designs in its latest collection.The label says its new Resort 2020 line “takes on the playful and colourful mood of a Latin holiday” and is about “visceral reactions of delight-eclectic patterns, unexpected silhouettes, pulsating energy”.It has certainly prompted an unexpected and energetic response from the Mexican government, which has asked the brand to explain why it is using designs “whose origins are well documented”.In a letter sent to Herrera and the company’s creative director, Wes Gordon, Frausto said: “This is a matter of ethical consideration that obliges us to speak out and bring an urgent issue to the UN’s sustainable development agenda: promoting inclusion and making those who are invisible visible.”The letter, seen by the Spanish newspaper El País, singled out certain designs.It claimed that one long white dress embroidered with bright animals, colours and flowers was derived from the culture of the Tenango de Doria community in Hidalgo state “where each piece of embroidery tells the story of the community and each element has a personal, family or community meaning”.Two other dresses, it added, incorporated elements from the famous traditional shawls of Saltillo in Coahuila state.In a statement, Carolina Herrera said the collection had been conceived as a “tribute to the richness of Mexican culture” and its craft techniques.“There’s an undeniable Mexican presence in this collection,” said Gordon. “It’s something that jumps out at you and I always intended it to be something latent as a way of showing my love for this country and for all the incredible work I’ve seen there.”The designer added: “My admiration for the artisanal work has only grown as I have travelled to Mexico over the years. With this new collection, I have tried to highlight the importance of this magnificent cultural heritage.”Last month, the Mexican government said a law would be brought before the senate to “tackle the plagiarism that different indigenous peoples and communities have suffered” by recognising them as the lawful owners of their cultural and identity elements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2efb0b70d06c49966f934316c1f95f2eea697a36/53_0_1573_944/master/1573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e20bcf755740d0516a26ce9f94c9d3","title":"oil tankers blasts reports gulf of oman us navy","story":"Sailors evacuated from two tankers in distress near the strategic Strait of HormuzTwo oil tankers have been hit in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman and the crews have been evacuated, a month after a similar incident in which four tankers in the region were struck.The US Navy’s fifth fleet said it was assisting the tankers, which issued distress calls from off the coast of the United Arab Emirates near the strategic Strait of Hormuz.Reports of the explosions originally came from the same Hezbollah-linked news agencies in Lebanon that correctly reported attacks on tankers docked off the coast of the UAE in May. The US blamed those attacks on Iran – an accusation Tehran denied.Front Altair was carrying 75,000 tonnes of naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock, when it was “suspected of being hit by a torpedo”, said Wu I-Fang from Taiwan’s state oil refiner CPC, which chartered the tanker. Iran state media reported that the Front Altair had sunk, though the ship’s operator Frontline said this was not the case.The Kokuka Courageous was damaged in a “suspected attack” that breached the hull above the water line while on passage from Saudi Arabia to Singapore, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement said. “The ship is safely afloat,” it added.Iranian state TV reported that 44 crew had been evacuated from the tankers to an Iranian port. Iran’s IRIB news agency tweeted an image of what it said was the Front Altair on fire. The picture has not been independently verified:The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, part of the Royal Navy, said it was investigating. “We are deeply concerned by reports of explosions and fires on vessels in the Strait of Hormuz. We are in contact with local authorities and partners in the region,” a British government spokeswoman said.Gulf tensions have been close to boiling point for weeks as the US puts “maximum economic pressure” on Tehran in an attempt to force it to reopen talks about the 2015 nuclear deal, which the US pulled out of last year.Iran has repeatedly said it has no knowledge and did not instruct any surrogate forces to attack Gulf shipping, or Saudi oil installations.An inquiry by the UAE into the attacks on 12 May found that the sophisticated mines were used by state-like actors, but did not identify Iran or any other state as the culprit. The US national security adviser, John Bolton, said Iran was almost certainly involved. An alternative explanation is that the attacks were undertaken by Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led efforts to oust them from Yemen.Iran has repeatedly said it has no knowledge of the attacks and did not instruct any surrogate forces to attack Gulf shipping, or Saudi oil installations.The latest incident came as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, held talks with the Iranian leadership in Tehran in a bid to see if a basis for discussions between the US and Iran can be found. Japan’s trade ministry says the two oil tankers involved in Thursday’s incidents carried “Japan-related” cargo.The Japanese stressed they were not bringing specific messages from the US president, Donald Trump, and said nothing that they had heard in the first day of talks suggested a breakthrough was imminent.Abe, seen as close to Trump but also a supporter of the original 2015 deal, met both the Iranian foreign minister Javed Zarif and the President Hassan Rouhani. On Thursday Abe also met Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.In a sign of how the Yemen civil war and the wider US-Iranian tensions are becoming intertwined, Riyadh accused Tehran of ordering a Yemeni rebel missile strike that wounded 26 people at a Saudi airport on Wednesday. “The continuation of the Iranian regime’s aggression and reckless escalation, whether directly or through its militias, will result in grave consequences,” the deputy defence minister, Prince Khaled bin Salman, said.Iran and the Yemeni rebels both follow branches of the Shia branch of Islam but Tehran has always denied providing more than moral support to the rebels.The rebels say that missile and drone strikes against Saudi Arabia are one of few ways that they can retaliate after more than for years of bombing by the Saudi-led coalition, which has exacted a heavy civilian death toll in Yemen."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Lone parents, migrants and Travellers most at risk for family homelessness \u0026ndash reportFigures from Department of Health cause \u0026lsquodeep unease\u0026rsquo within GovernmentOmbudsman for Children urges Government to monitor practice in schoolsPhysicist Ana Alonso-Serrano on black holes, wormholes and the multiverse theoryResearch Lives: Dr Xinxin Xiao, post-doctoral researcher at Technical University of DenmarkUnder new HSE policy workers urged to provide sincere apologies where errors occurLegislation to set up a tribunal on alleged misreading of smear tests to go to CabinetFirst day of visit included round-table discussion on immigration and meeting HigginsFrom Alcock and Brown\u0026rsquos transatlantic crossing to global commercial flights, the 20th century saw astonishing developments in aviationHuman rights \u0026lsquoset at naught\u0026rsquo by system to deal with international protection applicantsGovernment to establish two new assemblies on gender equality and local governmentPollutants from continental Europe also contributed to air quality breach in FebruaryThe veteran republican led a hunger strike in 1972 in bid to win political prisoner statusMinister plans to allow interest rate rise on personal loans despite Cabinet oppositionThe current Irish target is an 80 per cent reduction by mid centuryRail company makes announcement following incident on Galway to Dublin serviceRevenue down 4 per cent despite a substantial increase in visitor numbersProf Kevin Scannell awarded Fullbright Scholarship to develop Irish language computer resources"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923552.1560370255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when charles de gaulle came to ireland for six weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCharles de Gaulle and  Eamon de Valera at Áras an Uachtaráin. Photograph: Jimmy McCormack Fifty years before Donald Trump’s trip, another globally recognised politician came to Ireland on a private visit that turned out to be far from private.Gen Charles de Gaulle did not stay for two nights as Trump did in Doonbeg, but six weeks between May 10th and June 19th, 1969.In recent decades we have become used to American presidents, members of the British royal family and Hollywood celebrities staying in Ireland for a time and generally being effusive about the place.Ireland held no such cachet in the late 1960s, which made de Gaulle’s decision to holiday in Ireland a source of wonder at the time.The  editorial expressed it best: “The presence of General de Gaulle in Sneem, Co Kerry, is almost as bizarre, in its first impact, as would be the announcement that Chairman Mao had arrived in Bangor, Co Down to enjoy the amenities of Pickie Pool.”Less than two weeks prior to his arrival in Ireland, de Gaulle shocked France by resigning as president immediately after losing a referendum on constitutional reform which many people, not least the general himself, saw as a referendum on his 10 years as French leader.Press interest in de Gaulle was intense as he arrived at the Heron Cove Hotel in Sneem, Co Kerry. Gardaí surrounded the hotel and staged stand-offs with journalists and photographers trying to access the hotel via boat or through the dense undergrowth that surrounded the less than salubrious location.Important figureThough ostensibly a private citizen after his resignation as president, de Gaulle was too important a figure to be left to his own devices. The French ambassador Emmanuel d’Harcourt, an old friend of de Gaulle’s from the French Resistance, requested help to cope with the visit and Jean Guéguinou, a 27-year-old diplomat in the French foreign service, was dispatched to Ireland.After arriving in Sneem, he returned on the train to Dublin a day later with a diplomatic bag containing de Gaulle’s proxy vote to elect his successor.De Gaulle was less a political figure and more a “legend” in French life, he recalled. He was literally and figuratively a towering figure. Was he intimidated?“If I was modest, I would say yes,” said Guéguinou, who is back in Ireland 50 years after the visit. “He didn’t try to be intimidating. He wanted to give the impression he was a private citizen. Can you give the impression you are a normal citizen when you are de Gaulle?“I was much more intimidated when I left. My God, can you imagine? I’m 27 and I had dinner with M De Gaulle and Madame De Gaulle at this historical moment when he left power.”Guéguinou remembered the Heron Cove Hotel as less a hotel and more a big house with just 12 rooms, four taken by de Gaulle.His memories of the visit remain vivid. De Gaulle was “tired and certainly sad” when he first arrived at the hotel. He had a little office and was reading the memoirs of one of his favourite writers, François-René de Chateaubriand, while listening to French radio on long wave.De Gaulle finally gave the press some of what they were looking for with a memorable photo opportunity on Derrynane beach, in which his extreme height and melancholy bearing gave an added poignancy as a contemporary King Lear-like figure.He later travelled to Connemara, specifically to the Cashel House Hotel, near Roundstone, and then north to Co Down to meet some of his MacCartan ancestors on his mother’s side.The reason for de Gaulle’s decision to visit Ireland remains a mystery, despite his one public pronouncement on the matter. “It was a sort of instinct that led me towards Ireland, perhaps because of the Irish blood that courses in my veins. One always goes back to one’s source.”Guéguinou speculates that the reasons may be more practical than that. De Gaulle needed to be seen to depart public life and did not want to be in France for the presidential election or for June 18th, the anniversary of his historic address to the French nation from exile in London after the Nazi invasion.He had a complicated relationship with all the countries around him, which left Ireland, Guéguinou believes.“Ireland was a neutral country. It was a place without political significance for him at the time.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3923565.1560358976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland is an example to europe leading french politician","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            President Michael D.

He and a number of the party’s serving and former politicians have been in Ireland marking the 50th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle’s visit to the country in 1969.“You are a lesson of faith in the collective spirit without relinquishing what makes a nation,” he said in an interview with The . “The Gaullists today believe our sovereignty can be stronger when we share it. Nobody expected Ireland to delve into some sort of scepticism or popularism, which is not the same for countries like Italy, Austria and Germany. ” Ireland had served as an example to other countries by earning its independence through “suffering and without giving up”, he said. “It is very Gaullist to never give up even when everything seems lost.” Mr Larcher said there was “universal solidarity” across the French political system for Ireland’s position in relation to the backstop and Brexit which extends to president Macron, the prime minister Édouard Philippe and the president of the national assembly, Richard Ferrand. Similarly, he said 26 other member states of the EU were behind Ireland in relation to the backstop and the position taken by Mr Barnier and the EU president Jean-Claude Juncker. He said the recently proposed €1 billion electricity interconnector between France and Ireland, which is before the EU Commission for funding, was a “great symbol” of French solidarity with Ireland over Brexit. He also said France was looking at “privileging” Irish goods which once used the land bridge through the UK for export. SolidarityGeneral de Gaulle visited Ireland for five weeks in May and June 1969 just 12 days after resigning from office. Reflecting on the visit, Mr Larcher said de Gaulle had a “great solidarity with Ireland because of his roots” – de Gaulle’s maternal ancestors included the McCartan family from Co Down. He had also known “Irish soldiers” in the first World War, when he served as a company commander, was wounded and then taken prisoner. He greatly admired Irish nationalists who had fought in France, Mr Larcher maintained. In Sneem, where he stayed at the Heron Cove Hotel, de Gaulle started writing his final memoirs (he died a year later in 1970) about the fifth Republic which he founded in 1958 and his 10 years as French president. Mr Larcher praised the “spirit of Sneem” and de Gaulle’s contention while in Ireland that his destiny “was nothing compared to the destiny of France”.

receptionists gp surgeries discouraging men seeking help","story":"The committee has started an inquiry into the different factors leading to mental health problems in men and boysFemale receptionists at GP surgeries can put men off seeking help for mental health issues, MPs have been told.Professor Sarah Niblock, chief executive of the UK Council for Psychotherapy, said that sharing mental health issues with GP receptionists “could be a huge barrier for men actually coming forward and speaking about it in the first place.”Giving evidence to the Women and Equalities Committee, she added that “one of the huge problems we have is that stigma is much more acutely held among groups of men” and that “we are kind of a culture that seems to create shame.”The committee has started an inquiry into the different factors leading to mental health problems in men and boys, the barriers they face when accessing support and how frontline services can be more inclusive to overcome this.“Walking into my local GP, you have to tell someone on the desk, who is often female, why you want an appointment, what it is that’s causing you concern. That immediately could be a huge barrier for men actually coming forward and speaking about it in the first place,” said Prof Niblock.An invisible crisis | Mental health in developing countriesThis stigma was outlined by Andy Bell, Deputy Chief Executive at the Centre for Mental Health who argued that the most effective approaches to mental health issues involve creating a comfortable space for people.Using a case study in Birmingham, he said the support was “based on relationships and building a continuous, consistent relationship with someone rather than seeing endless people, and certainly not going down the route where you have to be diagnosed with an illness and go along to a building marked mental health.”According to the Office for National Statistics, three out of four people who take their own lives are men. This is the biggest cause of death for men under 50 in England and Wales.The Health and Social Care Information Centre says that men are three times more likely than women to become alcohol dependent, which can have devastating effects, as alcohol dependent men are eight times more likely to take their own lives than men who are not alcoholics.While “younger people are much more emotionally literate” according to Ruth Sutherland, CEO of Samaritans, currently, only one in three children who need mental health services are getting the help they require.To solve this, the NHS has proposed a ten-year plan to get fully trained mental health teams into schools to make the services more accessible for young people.Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123Oil tankers hit in fresh

Shopping centre owner Intu, which counts Arcadia as a tenant in 35 of its stores, refused to accept rent reductions of 25 to 50 per cent.Intu was the largest single voice at Wednesday’s meeting with an average 15 per cent share of the vote across various different CVA proposals.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesCrown Estates, Aviva, British Land and Hammerson were among those who voted in favour.Sir Philip – who has been out of the UK\u0026nbspas allegations have mounted about sexual misconduct –\u0026nbspwas not at the meeting. His family’s £100m yacht, the Lionheart, was sighted in Sanremo, Italy.Many of Arcadia’s brands still face a difficult task ahead to transform their fortunes which have been declining for a number of years.Joanne Fearnley, partner and a commercial property expert at law firm Gordons, said:\u0026nbsp“The threat of administration has been lifted and jobs saved… for now.\u0026nbsp“As we are seeing with other retailers who have followed the same route, time will tell whether or not this is a temporary saving. It may be that the dent to the confidence of landlords will result in them putting in place contingency plans on the prime locations in particular, so that the demise of Arcadia becomes inevitable over time.”Concerns also remain about a “massive” deficit in Arcadia’s pension scheme. Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, asked for a binding assurances that Sir Philip and his wife Lady Tina Green will personally promise that scheme members will get their full entitlement.Mr Field said:\u0026nbsp“Now that, thankfully, Arcadia’s life has been extended, the committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them.”The retail magnate had initially offered Arcadia’s creditors a deal that would have seen 23 of 570 stores close with another 25\u0026nbspearmarked to shut in future. But landlords baulked at proposed rent cuts of between 30 per cent and 70 per cent on 194 stores.Last week, a crunch vote on the plans was postponed after it became clear that Arcadia would not get the support of 75 per cent of creditors that was needed to push the deals through.\u0026nbspThat forced Sir Philip to table a last-minute offer of 25-50 per cent rent reductions, with the Green family paying an extra £30m towards rents over three years.Sir Philip and his family have taken large sums of money out of Arcadia, including a £1.2bn idend in 2005, the biggest UK corporate pay check in history at the time. Critics have said that he and his wife could have stumped up more cash for the struggling group.Philip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireSir Philip Green’s retail empire on the brinkTopshop to close all US storesSir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresTopshop and Primark could be hiring children aged 14 in factoriesArcadia’s troubles in getting its plans through could mark a turning point as landlords increasingly push back against CVAs.A source close to one landlord said it was felt that many of Arcadia’s stores were in prime locations that could be re-let if a new tenant was required.One landlord told the Press Association that Arcadia’s situation was different to that faced by large department stores like Debenhams and House of Fraser that have also put forward CVA plans.“There was some sympathy for Debenhams,” he said,\u0026nbsp“whereas here you’ve got a bigger pool of potential tenants. You’ve got more options so it’s easier to vote against it.“Not that many people are that emotional about it – there’s no tears for Philip Green.”A spokesperson for The Crown Estate said: “While we have voted in favour, we have done so to secure our ability to take control where we feel that a better offer can be delivered for our destinations. This may include re-letting our spaces to new retailers who are more aligned with our ongoing commitment to creating great places for local communities.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIan Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, said on Wednesday: “We are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals and to Lady Green for her continued support.\u0026nbspAfter many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing.\u0026nbsp“From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth through our digital and wholesale channels, while ensuring our store portfolio remains at the heart of our customer offer.\u0026nbsp“I am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multichannel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand, and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business.“Finally, I would like to thank all of our team and advisors for their support throughout the CVA process. It has been incredibly challenging for all concerned but I believe this is the right outcome for all our creditors.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now Sir Philip and his executives have to revive the business\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentGreen’s empire has survived after creditors voted in favour of Company Voluntary ArrangementsSo Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia lives on after his second attempt at getting seven company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) approved was successful.\u0026nbspBut the landlords have sure sent out a message. Watch out you retailers. If you come brandishing these things because you want rent reductions and store closures we’re going to make it jolly hard for you. We’re not going to just roll over when you threaten to call in the administrators. We’ll huff and we’ll puff and we’ll make a big song and dance about squeezing you. Then we’ll cave.\u0026nbspThing is, they didn’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspPhilip Green’s retail empire saved from administrationPhilip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireHe might not be a billionaire any more, at least by the reckoning of The Sunday Times Rich List, but thanks to the money he’s been able to take out of Arcadia and his other retail businesses, Sir Philip still has more\u0026nbspthan enough in the bank to keep himself and his family in the style to which they have become accustomed.\u0026nbspThe yacht, the Monaco pad, their membership to the 0.001 per cent, or whatever it is, their prosperity wasn’t at stake. For the landlords, the equation looked rather different. If Arcadia went down, they knew they’d be left with empty premises to fill at a time when there aren’t many retailers interested in new space.\u0026nbspThis is why the property owners who still have Topshops or Burtons or Miss Selfridges or whatever after the store closures approved through the\u0026nbspCVAs, a form of insolvency that retailers have for years been using to cut their cost bases, backed them. They will now get some rent as opposed to months of nothing, and a\u0026nbspbit more than was on the table during Sir Philip’s first attempt at getting these through. Thousands of jobs have also been saved, which has to be welcomed.\u0026nbspHow long that rent and the wages those jobs pay will keep flowing remains to be seen. Sir Philip made his money less as a retailer than as a deal maker. At the height of his powers, he had half the City’s bankers clamouring to do his bidding and he was able to take millions out of the businesses he bought with their help, or at least his wife Tina was. It’s her name on top of Arcadia’s shareholder register. It’s her that’s officially putting £50m into the business and more into the group’s pension funds.\u0026nbspLately, Sir Philip’s reputation has taken a few knocks. I’m not talking about the non-disclosure agreements and super injunctions that have been generating headlines all over the place. I’m talking about his reputation as a businessman in the wake of the failure of BHS, and now these CVAs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Richer Sounds has signed up to be a living hours employerIn the world outside the freak show of a Tory leadership battle, good ideas still occasionally emerge in Britain.\u0026nbspThe Living Wage Foundation served one up this morning with the launch of a living hours\u0026nbspcampaign,\u0026nbspdesigned to address an issue that goes hand in hand with poverty pay: insecure employment.\u0026nbspAccording to the organisation, more than 5 million workers earning less than the real living wage, the one set by the Foundation based on what is required to be able to maintain a decent basic standard of living, are also in insecure work, unsure of what hours they will get from week to week. Some 2 million of them are parents, for whom the problem is particularly acute. Not knowing your hours and thus not knowing your income is the recipe for a boatload of stress, all the more so if your hourly rate is low and you need to run around trying to arrange potentially expensive childcare at the drop of your employer’s hat.\u0026nbspRudd says people should take zero-hour jobs to avoid benefits cutsZero good news on zero hours contracts?Number of zero-hours contracts rises by 100,000 in 2017, says ONSThe campaign aims to address this by offering Living Hours accreditation to employers that want to set an example of good practice alongside the existing Living Wage accreditation.\u0026nbspEmployers that sign up will be required to provide workers with at least four weeks notice of shifts, and a contract that accurately reflects hours worked, while guaranteeing a minimum of 16 a week.Supporting the launch were energy provider SSE, Standard Life Aberdeen, the insurance and fund management group, and Richer Sounds. If that name rings a bell, it’s the hi-fi retailer whose founder Julian Richer recently sold control of the business to his employees and put a cherry on top by using part of the proceeds to pay them all a bonus.Richer, a longtime opponent of the zero-hours contracts that have grown like a weed in the British labour market, says businesses that treat the people who work for them well benefit from happier, better-motivated employees who are inclined to stick around.His company shows just how potent that can be. On a high street that has seen more deaths than the average episode of Game of Thrones, Richer Sounds is thriving.Can you see the drawback? It’s all very well to sign up organisations that are already\u0026nbspprogressive employers\u0026nbsp(Richer basically sets the gold standard for the retail industry)\u0026nbspand that already have Living Wage accreditation.But the real problem lies elsewhere, with employers that range from not very good to the out-and-out awful. There’s a\u0026nbsplot of them about. The numbers the Foundation has produced demonstrate\u0026nbspthat.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

But it runs the risk of simply serving to make employers that are already good a bit better.\u0026nbspWhich brings us back to that Tory leadership campaign, most of whose runners would probably tell you zero-hours contracts are fine and dandy because workers “value their flexibility” when the flexibility is almost always with the employer, not the employee,\u0026nbspmost of whom would gladly trade it in for a tad more security.If the campaign does manage to guilt the odd bad employer into shaping up, it could be counted a success.\u0026nbspBut to end the exploitation embedded in the zero-hours culture it will take legislation, and probably a change of government.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesCrown Estates, Aviva, British Land and Hammerson were among those who voted in favour.Sir Philip – who has been out of the UK\u0026nbspas allegations have mounted about sexual misconduct –\u0026nbspwas not at the meeting. His family’s £100m yacht, the Lionheart, was sighted in Sanremo, Italy.Many of Arcadia’s brands still face a difficult task ahead to transform their fortunes which have been declining for a number of years.Joanne Fearnley, partner and a commercial property expert at law firm Gordons, said:\u0026nbsp“The threat of administration has been lifted and jobs saved… for now.\u0026nbsp“As we are seeing with other retailers who have followed the same route, time will tell whether or not this is a temporary saving. It may be that the dent to the confidence of landlords will result in them putting in place contingency plans on the prime locations in particular, so that the demise of Arcadia becomes inevitable over time.”Concerns also remain about a “massive” deficit in Arcadia’s pension scheme. Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, asked for a binding assurances that Sir Philip and his wife Lady Tina Green will personally promise that scheme members will get their full entitlement.Mr Field said:\u0026nbsp“Now that, thankfully, Arcadia’s life has been extended, the committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them.”The retail magnate had initially offered Arcadia’s creditors a deal that would have seen 23 of 570 stores close with another 25\u0026nbspearmarked to shut in future. But landlords baulked at proposed rent cuts of between 30 per cent and 70 per cent on 194 stores.Last week, a crunch vote on the plans was postponed after it became clear that Arcadia would not get the support of 75 per cent of creditors that was needed to push the deals through.\u0026nbspThat forced Sir Philip to table a last-minute offer of 25-50 per cent rent reductions, with the Green family paying an extra £30m towards rents over three years.Sir Philip and his family have taken large sums of money out of Arcadia, including a £1.2bn idend in 2005, the biggest UK corporate pay check in history at the time. Critics have said that he and his wife could have stumped up more cash for the struggling group.Philip Green offers more money in last-ditch attempt to save empireSir Philip Green’s retail empire on the brinkTopshop to close all US storesSir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group confirms slew of shop closuresTopshop and Primark could be hiring children aged 14 in factoriesArcadia’s troubles in getting its plans through could mark a turning point as landlords increasingly push back against CVAs.A source close to one landlord said it was felt that many of Arcadia’s stores were in prime locations that could be re-let if a new tenant was required.One landlord told the Press Association that Arcadia’s situation was different to that faced by large department stores like Debenhams and House of Fraser that have also put forward CVA plans.“There was some sympathy for Debenhams,” he said,\u0026nbsp“whereas here you’ve got a bigger pool of potential tenants. You’ve got more options so it’s easier to vote against it.“Not that many people are that emotional about it – there’s no tears for Philip Green.”A spokesperson for The Crown Estate said: “While we have voted in favour, we have done so to secure our ability to take control where we feel that a better offer can be delivered for our destinations. This may include re-letting our spaces to new retailers who are more aligned with our ongoing commitment to creating great places for local communities.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIan Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, said on Wednesday: “We are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals and to Lady Green for her continued support.\u0026nbspAfter many months of engaging with all our key stakeholders, taking on board their feedback, and sharing our turnaround plans, the future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing.\u0026nbsp“From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth through our digital and wholesale channels, while ensuring our store portfolio remains at the heart of our customer offer.\u0026nbsp“I am confident about the future of Arcadia and our ability to provide our customers with the very best multichannel experience, deliver the fashion trends that they demand, and ultimately inspire a renewed loyalty to our brands that will support the long-term growth of our business.“Finally, I would like to thank all of our team and advisors for their support throughout the CVA process. It has been incredibly challenging for all concerned but I believe this is the right outcome for all our creditors.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This allows people who have not been able to save a large deposit to get on the housing ladder.But the\u0026nbspNAO\u0026nbspsaid that Help to Buy has\u0026nbsp“tied up significant financial capacity” that could have been used for other housing schemes.Up to December 2018, £11.7bn had been loaned under the scheme with that figure\u0026nbspforecast to more than doouble to\u0026nbsparound £25bn\u0026nbspby 2023. Help to Buy\u0026nbsphas also exposed the public purse\u0026nbspto significant financial risk if house prices fall, the NAO said.Despite these concerns, and widespread criticism that Help to Buy has pumped up already inflated property prices, the department has not made a detailed assessment of the impact of the scheme on the wider housing market.“The government’s greatest challenge now is to wean the property market off the scheme with as little impact as possible on its ambition of creating 300,000 homes a year from the mid-2020s,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.All you need to know about paying back your Help to Buy loanThe Help to Buy hack helping second steppers trade up the ladderShould first-time buyers get a Help to Buy ISA before they close?Total value of Help to Buy loans smashes £10bnPersimmon’s profits soar past £1bn on back of Help to Buy scheme“Until we can observe its longer-term effects on the property market and whether the department has recovered its substantial investment, we cannot say whether the scheme has delivered value for money.” \u0026nbspLabour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the NAO report showed that Help to Buy is failing to provide assistance to those who need it.“This report confirms the fundamental flaws in Help to Buy which ministers have failed to fix,” he said.“One in five helped by Help to Buy aren’t even first-time buyers and two-thirds of buyers could have bought without this assistance.“The current scheme is poorly targeted and poor value for taxpayers’ money. Help to Buy should be tightly targeted on first-time buyers with low and middle incomes, as Labour has long argued.“George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, introduced Help to Buy in 2013, hailing it as the “the biggest government intervention in the housing market since the Right to Buy scheme”.But it has been widely criticised by economists and housing market analysts, who have said it has had a minimal effect in increasing the supply of homes.\u0026nbspIt has also helped boost the profits of large house builders, five of which have scooped half of all sales made using the scheme.Redrow made up 3.7 per cent of sales, Bellway accounted for 6.7 per cent, Taylor Wimpey made up 11.9 per cent, Barratt made up 13.3 per cent and Persimmon accounted for 14.8 per cent, according to the NAO’s analysis.The boss of Persimmon, the largest beneficiary of Help to Buy, resigned last year after outrage over his £75m bonus,\u0026nbspwhich had been boosted by sales subsidised with public money. Persimmon said Jeff Fairburn’s bonus had become “a distraction”.Commenting on the report, Fran Boait, executive director of campaigning body Positive Money, said: “It’s now beyond clear that rather than helping those who can’t afford to buy a home, Help To Buy has mainly been a subsidy for a housing bubble, benefiting property developers and existing home owners.”help to buy\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.Primavera is one of the biggest and most anticipated festivals around.

Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.The band have called off the below shows, in order to allow\u0026nbspBockrath\u0026nbspto recover.12 June:\u0026nbspAmsterdam, Netherlands at Melkweg Max14 June: London, UK at Heaven15 June: Isle of Wight at Isle of Wight Festival17 June: Edinburgh, UK at The Liquid RoomNatasia Demetriou: ‘We work in such a misogynistic industry’Album reviews: Lizzo, Fat White Family and Cage the ElephantMatt Shultz: ‘There was a huge potential of me not being here’18 June: Birmingham, UK at O2\u0026nbspInstitute2The tour was due to promote the band’s fifth album,\u0026nbspSocial Cues.\u0026nbspRead an exclusive interview\u0026nbspwith Cage The Elephant’s frontman, Matt Schultz,\u0026nbsphere.Cage the Elephant\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

This allows people who have not been able to save a large deposit to get on the housing ladder.But the\u0026nbspNAO\u0026nbspsaid that Help to Buy has\u0026nbsp“tied up significant financial capacity” that could have been used for other housing schemes.Up to December 2018, £11.7bn had been loaned under the scheme with that figure\u0026nbspforecast to more than doouble to\u0026nbsparound £25bn\u0026nbspby 2023. Help to Buy\u0026nbsphas also exposed the public purse\u0026nbspto significant financial risk if house prices fall, the NAO said.Despite these concerns, and widespread criticism that Help to Buy has pumped up already inflated property prices, the department has not made a detailed assessment of the impact of the scheme on the wider housing market.“The government’s greatest challenge now is to wean the property market off the scheme with as little impact as possible on its ambition of creating 300,000 homes a year from the mid-2020s,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.All you need to know about paying back your Help to Buy loanThe Help to Buy hack helping second steppers trade up the ladderShould first-time buyers get a Help to Buy ISA before they close?Total value of Help to Buy loans smashes £10bnPersimmon’s profits soar past £1bn on back of Help to Buy scheme“Until we can observe its longer-term effects on the property market and whether the department has recovered its substantial investment, we cannot say whether the scheme has delivered value for money.” \u0026nbspLabour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the NAO report showed that Help to Buy is failing to provide assistance to those who need it.“This report confirms the fundamental flaws in Help to Buy which ministers have failed to fix,” he said.“One in five helped by Help to Buy aren’t even first-time buyers and two-thirds of buyers could have bought without this assistance.“The current scheme is poorly targeted and poor value for taxpayers’ money. Help to Buy should be tightly targeted on first-time buyers with low and middle incomes, as Labour has long argued.“George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, introduced Help to Buy in 2013, hailing it as the “the biggest government intervention in the housing market since the Right to Buy scheme”.But it has been widely criticised by economists and housing market analysts, who have said it has had a minimal effect in increasing the supply of homes.\u0026nbspIt has also helped boost the profits of large house builders, five of which have scooped half of all sales made using the scheme.Redrow made up 3.7 per cent of sales, Bellway accounted for 6.7 per cent, Taylor Wimpey made up 11.9 per cent, Barratt made up 13.3 per cent and Persimmon accounted for 14.8 per cent, according to the NAO’s analysis.The boss of Persimmon, the largest beneficiary of Help to Buy, resigned last year after outrage over his £75m bonus,\u0026nbspwhich had been boosted by sales subsidised with public money. Persimmon said Jeff Fairburn’s bonus had become “a distraction”.Commenting on the report, Fran Boait, executive director of campaigning body Positive Money, said: “It’s now beyond clear that rather than helping those who can’t afford to buy a home, Help To Buy has mainly been a subsidy for a housing bubble, benefiting property developers and existing home owners.”help to buy\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Human species are not believed to inhabited this region until much later.Created with Sketch.New species of ancient human discovered - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandA foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandIt is not clear if the wolf, which is estimated to have been between two and four years old when it died, would have been larger or smaller than contemporary wolf species, though scientists said it had stronger jaws which enabled it to kill bigger animals, including bison.The 40-centimetre head was put on public display at a woolly mammoth exhibition in Tokyo last week.Dr Albert Protopopov, head of mammoth fauna studies at the Yakutia academy of sciences told the Siberian Times: “This is a unique discovery of the first ever remains of a fully grown Pleistocene wolf with its tissue preserved. We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance.”Addressing those who suggested the head resembled that of a bear, Dr Protopopov said: “It is definitely a wolf. Maybe the hair colouring makes people think it is a bear, but actually it is quite strange to hear, as morphologically this is a very typical wolf. “Yet when we made CTA scans of the wolf, we found out there are some peculiarities.“Some parts of the skull are more developed than in modern wolves.”He added: “We want to find out if this represents the inidual characteristics of this very specimen or if this can be a wolf sub-species, given the different environment in which these animals lived.He said he was doubtful the specimen was a direwolf – an extinct species which populated North America at the end of the Pleistocene and which at the time was joined to Siberia by a land bridge.“I would say it was not a direwolf, but we are not ready to give exact size of this wolf when it was alive.Return of the wolf: Not big or bad, just misunderstood‘Swarms’ of wolf-dog hybrids sweeping EuropeScientists ‘one step closer’ to bringing back woolly mammothsWhy mammoths, sabre-tooth tigers and other ‘megafauna’ went extinct“It was definitely smaller than modern Arctic wolves, closer to the common wolf in its size.”The research team is in the process of planning a return expedition to the site to see if further remains can be found.Dr Protopopov said the colouring of the preserved hairs were not indicative of how the animal would have appeared when it was alive, as the natural pigments had been destroyed and replaced by colouring from the permafrost.“As a result, we cannot add any information to the discussion on whether the Pleistocene wolves were grey or dark,” he said.The earth in Yakutia is typically frozen all year round, but climate change means previously frozen soils are increasingly easy to explore, giving rise to a large mammoth-tusk hunting industry, from which an increasing number of paleontological finds have been made.The exhibition in Tokyo featuring the wolf head is also exhibiting the carcass of a cave lion cub believed to be 50,000 years old.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love.

It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

At least one called on Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, to intervene.In 2014, concerns were raised about “Zoo Lates”, which were advertised as an “after-party with the animals” where some visitors reportedly drank excessively.Zoo accused of stressing animals with hen parties and stag dosOne man threw beer into the tiger enclosure and another, according to witnesses, tried to climb into the penguin pool. Some people reported butterflies were crushed underfoot.The next year, the zoo replaced Zoo Lates with Sunset Safaris. This time the gorilla kingdom was off-limits to visitors, and is again this year, to allow two baby gorillas to sleep.On Facebook, Sheena Bleakney, posted: “Not satisfied with keeping animals in captivity their entire lives, making them a spectacle during the hours of daylight, you chose greed and profit over their wellbeing during the hours of darkness for people to party with the animals. Shame on you London zoo, what about this event benefits the animals? Protects species?”Ellie Brookes added: “Can you imagine how horrific it is for these animals, loud music, drunken people. These maybe captive animals (cruel enough) but they are also wild and haven’t been domesticated for hundreds of years like dogs and cats so this disturbance will be especially terrifying for them.”Endangered female tiger killed by potential mate at London ZooHow London Zoo’s big ‘weigh in’ could help conservation in the wildLondon Zoo lion inbreeding causes ‘high level of deaths’, finds reportFour meerkats killed in London Zoo fire were all brothersJoanna Hardeman posted that the animals’ “permanent residency is forced and their lives are trapped yet you wish to punish them further. You cannot claim that such irresponsible events are for the benefit of the ‘residents’ when they cannot escape inebriates, loud music, taunting, and other traumatic incidents like those seen at previous events.”ZSL said visitors are searched to prevent them bringing in alcohol. Kathryn England, ZSL’s chief operating officer, said: “If anyone is behaving in a way we don’t like we will take action. But those coming are animal lovers and these evenings are not about the alcohol.”The noise limit allowed is 70 decibels – about the noise level of\u0026nbspan average street.Ms England said nobody in masks was ever allowed near the animal houses,\u0026nbspthat the animals’ bedtimes were kept the same as all year round, and that animal welfare came first.She was disappointed by critics’ “inaccurate” portrayal of the events allowing “people who are passionate about animals and conservation to have an enjoyable evening”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has said that he will be the servant of parliament in delivering Brexit. Mark Harper, the former chief whip, acknowledges that he is the underdog in this race. He claims to be a truly fresh face, compared with other candidates who have served in the cabinet. He has suggested that a further delay to Brexit may be necessary if the new prime minister is to negotiate a new deal.As the overwhelming favourite among the party membership, Boris Johnson is relying on his charisma to walk his way to the highest position in government. While there is a growing Stop Boris collective of Tory MPs, many in the party believe that he is the only candidate who could win a general election. He insists that Britain must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the house of commons, is pitching herself as the party unity candidate. Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader. She will prepare to leave without a deal but claims to have a three-point plan for Brexit which she will set out later in the race. Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is the most direct opposition to frontrunner Boris Johnson similarly inclined to a hard Brexit but not as controversial among Tory MPs. He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31. Raab announced his bid on Sunday 26 May, 2 days after the Prime Minister announced her departure date.Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, is somewhat of an outsider, he only joined the cabinet for the first time at the beginning of May. He is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, drawing on his unique diplomatic experience and pledging to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He has caught attention on social media for his campaigning approachEsther Mcvey, the former work and pensions secretary, is standing on a hard Brexit promise. She suggests that the EU ought to approach Britain with a better deal and pledges to step-up preparations for a no-deal Brexit.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, intends to stand for unity in a United Kingdom. He pledges to restore trust in politics by delivering Brexit. He has served in two cabinet positions in May\u0027s government, first as housing secretary before replacing Amber Rudd as home secretary, a role in which he garnered controversy over his declaration of a major incident when around 40 migrants attempted to cross the channel in small boats.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, aims to be a fresh leader for the future after delivering Brexit.

He has suggested that a further delay to Brexit may be necessary if the new prime minister is to negotiate a new deal.With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sooner or later that debt is paid.”It’s open to debate whether the disaster, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s  quote in the credits suggested, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.What’s undeniable is that Chernobyl is one of the greatest TV dramas of the century.The beautul and touching tribute  Up paid to Lynn Johnson. Over-caffeinated tubbalump Piers Morgan once again turning Good Morning  Britain’s week into a captivating and unmissable mix of news, sport, presidential interviews, free- wheeling abuse and fantastically rude suggestions about Susanna Reid’s love le.And Harry Hill breaking off an insanely funny episode of Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by TalkSport genius Paul Hawksbee, to wonder: “Could I just live off the money from You’ve Been Framed ”Yes, but please don’t.RANDOM TV irritations: Killing Eve II posting a good mid-term shout for the most over-rated and unpleasant show of .The Sky Atlantic continuity pox who talked all over the closing credits of Chernobyl.ITV’s Clive Tyldesley sounding more like a fan than a commentator at the Euro Nations.And Love Island’s Iain Stirling “sending solidarity to the Donald Trump blimp protesters”, at the end of Good Morning Britain, like he was Lech Walesa addressing Gdansk shipyard workers, rather than the ITV dating show bloke doing the warm-up slot for Lorraine Kelly.THE week’s most eye-catching documentary began with a production assistant vox-popping some chimpanzee sex videos and a startled shopper exclaiming:  “Oh wow.“You’re really showing this on Channel  ”What  You thought better of the network behind Naked  Attraction Of course they’re showing My Gay Dog  And Other Animals, a right-on farce which attempted to prove the impossible via a mutt called Norman, whose rear end received not a moment’s peace from a humping little nuisance called Franco, an Italian Greyhound, who really should’ve been called Bruno or Tonioli.There were also “gay” lions and sheep, “bisexual” binobos and some field study input from Professor Paul Vasey, who’s been observing “lesbian” macaques for  years but, like all academics, still has more questions than answers: “Are they doing this to commun- icate about dominance “Are they doing this to form alliances “Are they doing this to reconcile conflict ”Or are they just doing this ’cos they  can’t get Wentworth on Netflix You tell me, weirdo.After a solid hour of virtue-signalling and speculation, though,  it was left to the narrator to tell us what any  three-year-old could’ve explained  minutes ago.“We can’t confirm Franco’s sexuality   per cent, however . . .”BZZZZZ.

In fact, they have all been produced and distributed by the BBC’s rivals.This week there was uproar after the BBC announced that over-s will now lose the right to their free TV licence, saving around £m per year.And we all know where theyll be splashing this cash - chasing the elusive youth market whove turned away from the BBC in their droves in favour of online streaming services like Netflix, Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video.But as a -year-old who ditched their licence fee last year - instead Im a fully paid-up member of Generation Netflix - I can tell them theyre going about it all wrong.For young people like me, it’s clear that the BBC is stuck in the past. In fact, it’s so out-of-touch that it still offers a discount for anyone whose TV only works in black and white.It’s easy to see how the Beeb’s snooty tone and we-know-best attitude earned it the nickname ‘Auntie’. Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

tens of thousands of bottles of water - some were seen loading dozens into supermarket trolleys.Pictures were posted on social media showing shelves stripped bare of drinking water as people were left without supplies for hours. Many worried customers have also been tweeting to ask when emergency supplies would be issued by the authorities.Others were quick to askthey would be receiving any compensation as a result of the water supply outage.One Twitter user, who was recovering from surgery, askedanyone knew when bottled water was being distributed, adding she cant carry heavy things and my local is out of bottled.Kerry Watts also wrote: Five hours without water - surely its time to get some bottles out to the most needy Residents in Whitton, Teddington and Isleworth have also been affected and Ealing Council revealed that some residents in the borough were also without water.Parts of Ealing, Hounslow, Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith and Fulham have also been affected by the pipe

They are believed to have been part of a network which players, coaches and victims told the Mirror worked at clubs across England. One ex-Southampton coach said: “Higgins, Carson and Bennell were an item. They took teams to Sweden, where Carson ended up.”  Carson died in a car crash in January, on the day he was due to face trial on abuse charges.Last year Bennell, , was jailed for  years after being convicted of  counts of abuse during a career which involved ties with Manchester City and Crewe. Higgins and Bennell were photographed together in  at a UK parade of junior teams.Bennell also ran youth side Manchester Senrab with Frank Roper, a former Blackpool scout, now deceased, who abused former England star Paul Stewart. Andy Woodward, the ex-Crewe player who sparked the probe into the scandal in , is convinced Bennell was part of a network. He said: “I remember being in the car with Barry when he met up with Frank Roper. Definitely there was a network.” And former Cha star Gary Johnson believes his abuser at the club, chief scout Eddie Heath, was also involved.Gary said: “We didn’t know about collaboration between the ringleaders at the time. Now it all makes sense.” Smirking Higgins joked in the dock at Winchester crown court before being jailed for  counts of indecent assault from  to .  Most victims were players at Southampton and Peterborough Utd.Former Peterborough trainee Dion Raitt questioned why Higgins was allowed to work despite warnings about his predatory behaviour.He said: “Football was our lives, our dreams – it was all that mattered. Higgins used that to exploit our vulnerability.” Hampshire Police said no evidence was found of a wider conspiracy in the Higgins inquiry but any new allegations will be investigated. Southampton has offered an “unreserved apology” to trainees who were abused by Higgins.

Duchess of Cambridge chose a glittering ensemble for her meal, prepared by people whose lives have been touched by drugs and alcohol. Unlike the gloomy weather in central London, the royal was full of summer cheer and bloom as she met guests who have beaten addiction. The event was hosted by charity Action on Addiction, of which Kate is a patron.The mum-of-three chose a cream, off-the-shoulder dress by Barbara Casasola. The duchess has been patron for the charity, which offers le-saving treatment to both iniduals and their families, since . Speaking at the dinner, Kate said: Sadly, for many who are suffering with addiction, they just don’t receive the help they need early enough.    Action on Addiction was one of my very first patronages, and as such, it is very close to my heart.   I’m hugely passionate about the support it provides, especially for parents, children and families who suffer from, or through, addiction.   And in some ways, it was the catalyst for my interest in early childhood development. The royal said the root causes of drug and alcohol addiction could often be traced back to the very earliest years, as she called for help to break the inter-generational cycle. She added: For the last few years, I’ve been focusing on the importance of prevention:  how can we all really support the earliest years of le, build foundations, and help avoid adversity later on in le.     Having met so many people who’ve suffered from addiction, I have seen over and over again that, sadly, the root causes can so often be traced right back to the very earliest years of someone’s le.   Trauma experienced in early childhood, in some cases, as a result of separation, abandonment, abuse, or even emotional neglect, can have a lasting effect. What we experience during our earliest years, even while we’re still in the womb, shapes the developing brain.   It is therefore vital that we support everyone  who cares for children in those formative years, especiallywe want to help with the inter-generational cycle of addiction.  Sadly, for many who are suffering with addiction, they just don’t receive the help they need early enough. They have already reached crisis point before the support they need. What’s remarkable about Action on Addiction is that it goes beyond helping those who are suffering on the courageous journey into recovery - but it also lends direct support to the children and families affected by addiction – for as long as it takes.   This evening’s dinner not only marks ‘Addiction Awareness Week’, but it also provides an opportunity for us to remember the vital work being done to help all those affected by addiction feel able to access help, hope and freedom from their addiction. There was never a more important time for Action on Addiction to succeed. And I, for one, could not be more delighted to support such a special organisation.  It was the first annual gala dinner in recognition of Addiction Awareness Week, hosted by chef Skye Gyngell and Action on Addiction, a British charity working in research, treatment, family support and professional education.  A spokesman said Action on Addiction builds communities of recovery for iniduals and families by developing the best quality and most effective residential and community-based addiction treatment services in the UK and promoting self-help, peer-to-peer support, and community cohesion. The Duchess has previously spoken of how her work with addicts helped her realise the signicance of mental health as central to many issues.  It is currently helping inform her work in developing a major project around support for children in their earliest years, a spokesman said.

Not all is at it seems however.The listed address doesnapost actually exist and the phone number, when called by the Manchester Evening News , isnapost answered.   The cityaposs council has warned it is a sham, with the website linked to an IP address in Nigeria. The website claims that the Grand Pearl is one of the newest  star hotels in the city, operating since  and hosting thousands of guests in that time - including celebrities and politicians. Photos show large double beds lying beneath expansive headboards, with plenty of room to relax in the seating area or get down to some important work at the desk. One clue that the hotel is less corporal than advertised are the landscapes visible through the window. In one a majestic cityscape has skyscrapers towering above what appears to be a Tokyo skyline. In another a palm tree stands out against the bright blue sky and sea.    The continuity error hasnapost stopped the website host asking £ for the cheapest room. Those looking to check in to the fictional hotel can rest assured they will be in safe hands. Around the clock security guards and an in-house medical team guarantee guestsapos security. The website boasts: Dangers of many kinds can lurk at any corner therefore we have taken all necessary measures to ensure your safety and peace of mind while playing host to you.” A -space car park, casino, art gallery, grand ballroom for as many as  people and an outlet selling Versace are other key features.    A number of customer testimonials featured on one page of the site speak highly of the hotel, despite its total lack of existence. One, posted by George B B from Sheffield, reads: “This hotel must have the most comfy beds in Manchester! Itaposs ideally located for nights out, also has a great bar.” Angela Bunett from Madrid recalls a stay for a friendaposs th birthday. “We did not get to eat in the Grand Pearl Oval Restaurant as we failed to make reservations on time and it was fully booked,” she wrote.    “The sunny personality of the concierge was heartwarming. Did not get his name but when I do I will mention him in my next review as I will be staying there again shortly. Keep up the good work. Location superb.” In an attempt to confirm the existence of the mystery hotel Manchester Evening News reporter Chris Slater went to the given address only to find an empty parking lot and an office. A receptionist inside the building told him: We often get people coming in asking for the Radisson but never that one.    In fact we get people who are lost and are looking for hotels all over the city and I have never, ever heard of the Grand Pearl. That sounds more like a Chinese buffet restaurant than a five star hotel.

However, manager Hafiza Riaz claims Mr King only did one full sht before “walking out” midway through his second sht – something he disputes. However, Ms Riaz confirmed Mr King was not paid for any of the work he did at the store at the end of May. He now wants the shop to reimburse him for his travel costs and for the hours he spent working in the store. Mr King, , told Hull Live : “I worked for free and it felt like slave labour. I’m on Universal Credit and have £ to live on a month after I’ve paid everything and I must have spent £ of that on transport to get to the shop. “£ is a big chunk of money for me and losing that has left me struggling.

The top savoury dishes, which were liked by over  per cent of people who had tried them, were Yorkshire puddings, Sunday roasts, fish and chips, crumpets, full English breakfasts and bacon sandwiches.    Whereas, the least popular delicacies, enjoyed by less than  per cent of respondents, were steak and kidney pudding, black pudding, kippers, liver and onion, haggis, faggots, laverbread, and jellied eels. Pork pies, scotch eggs, beef Wellington, bubble and squeak and Lancashire hotpot all fared poorly in the poll, although bangers and mash, cottage pie and shepherdaposs pie were liked by more than  per cent of the people polled. The most popular desserts were scones and Victoria sponge cake, while deep fried Mars bars came bottom of the list.    Other popular sweet treats included hot cross buns, sticky toffee pudding, bakewell tart and Eton mess, whereas some of the least favourite desserts were Battenberg cake, spotted dick, Christmas pudding, Eccles cake and Welsh cakes. Some people were furious about the rankings and the fact that some snacks had been left out.The official Twitter account for bakery Greggs questioned why sausage rolls had not been included in the poll.   Andrew Edwards wrote: Black pudding and liver and onion in the bottom tier. Behave! And crumpet in the top tier  Having a laugh. We’re a mess of a country. Jason Stevens-Read added: Erm  Toad in the hole, steak and kidney pie and black pudding should all be minimum top tiernot God tier! Despite this, some users did voice support for the findings. Tori Blakeman tweeted: Agree with the top tier to be honest! At least you can vouch for fish and chips, also chicken tikka masala should be top tier.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argylls got talent","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn exciting celebration of the creativity and talents of Mid Argyll young people will be on show at two fantastic events on Saturday June .In the afternoon, Lochgilphead High School’s final matinée performance of Romeo and Juliet will take place at .pm at the Joint Campus.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  BBC   s disgraceful excesses have brought about this sorry mess","story":"As the BBC announces that from June  it will end free TV licences for over-s who do not receive pension credit, nostalgia for the Beeb of old will be tinged not just with regret but a sense of betrayal. Of course there will be thousands of this vintage who can cough up pound without a second thought, barely denting their cruise-ship budget or round-the-world jaunts. But we should be in no doubt there are just as many who, eventhey do not qualy for pension credit, will have to cut back on other essentials in order to secure this leline. And beyond them, hidden in the shadows, are those in serious poverty, who are too proud, too isolated or too uninformed, to apply for benefits they are due.The argument over whether the licence fee should be free for the elderly, however, is not, and should never be, entirely about affordability. It is a question of principle. We live in an age in which digital entertainment and news provision has become a Wild West frontier, offering myriad possibilities for those with access to online services, the skill to navigate them, and the cash to pay. Netflix, Sky, Amazon Prime and others all clamour for custom, chipping away at the BBCrsquos once-monolithic status. For a business with a glut of extremely well-paid captains at the helm, the corporation has been astonishingly slow to recognise the threat viewersrsquo changing habits pose to its future.I doubt there is anyone under  who would not blithely go where without a momentrsquos regret. Doubtless they already wonder why they should pay a licence on top of other subscription fees, especially when they can also stream much of what they want for free. But those who are over , who grew up with John Reithrsquos dream, are umbilically attached. The BBC schedule is the clock around which their day is constructed, be it The Archers, Test Match Special, the Six OrsquoClock News, or The Antiques Roadshow. Without this devoted audience, the BBC would have shrivelled long ago. It is to these stalwarts that Lord Reithrsquos baby owes its existence, and its prestige. To turf them overboard when money grows tight is not just disgraceful, it makes no sense.Announcing this decision, in the tones of a funeral director sorry for their loss, the BBC Chairman and Director-General explained the arithmetic in such a way that it seems there is no alternative. The end of Government funding for free licences will leave a pound million hole in its bank account. The alternative, they said, would be to close stations such as BBC Two and Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland Channel and Radio  Live, among others, all of which, clearly, is deemed unthinkable.Read more: Tories accused of broken promise in free TV licence rowYet the time for the unthinkable is not today. It was not even four years ago, when Westminster gave notice of pulling its subsidy. The moment for a strategic rethink and recalibration was  and more years ago. At that point, the exponential expansion of digital s was already transforming peoplersquos relationship with screen and sound. This was when the BBC needed to look hard at its role and purpose and come up with a remodelled, leaner profile, fit for a new century. Instead, it has continued to expand, astomorrow will never arrive.Many of the over-s, a generation bred to thrt, will be puzzled by the Beebrsquos fiscal philosophy. Stories of extravagant pay-outs and salaries, of a costly failed IT project, of wastefulness and excess, have dented its reputation as a wise user of licence fees. Surely, instead of penalising those on whose loyalty it has been built, it should be narrowing its focus and making ends meet For far too long the corporation has had delusions of grandeur. In trying to position itself as a front-runner in global as well as regional news, in attempting to capture every market and age group, it has spread itself too thin. In the process, its online sites have imperilled the existence of commercial media companies whose survival is not protected by licence-fee payers, as have its magazines.This is not to suggest giving programme-makers even fewer resources with which to produce the same output. Rather, it is to ask for a radical streamlining, a concentration of energies and talent, on the things the BBC has always done brilliantly: drama, documentaries, music and news. Instead of courting fickle youth, it should be actively nurturing and sustaining older viewers who depend upon it. Axing their free pass is not only an easy and predictable response, but unimaginative and short-sighted ndash symptoms, you might say, of what already ails it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9977581.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-holds-positive-talks-with-michel-barnier-and-jean-claude-juncker","story":"The First Minister held talks for  minutes with the European Commissionrsquos chiefBrexitnegotiator as part of a whirlwind  hours for the SNP leader.MichelBarnier and Nicola Sturgeon met in Barniersoffice in the Berlaymont building in Brussels a day afterSturgeondescribed theConservativecontest to succeedTheresa Mayas a ldquohorror show.President @JunckerEU - with @MichelBarnier - welcomes First Minister of #Scotland @NicolaSturgeon.

A chorus of MPs cheered and applauded at all the right moments as the candidate rambled through his speech that denounced the nihilistic socialism of Jeremy Corbyn and held up the moderate, sensible, modern Conservatism, which he proudly espoused.Then came the tricky bit as the hacks prepared their questions, salivating at finally getting the chance to have a pot-shot at the submarine, which had finally surfaced.One question packaged some of the bad stuff, including how Mr J had offended people at home and abroad as Foreign Secretary, how he was cavalier with detail and how he had given mixed messages on Brexit.

Furthermore, Ireland and the UK have agreed to an Exclusive Economic Zoneboundary that places Rockall within the UKs EEZ.The sole factual argument for the Republic of Ireland is that its mainland is closer to Rockall, than the Scottish mainland is to Rockall. However, the closest permanently inhabited island to Rockall is North Uist at  miles. Therefore, Rockall would be within the UKs EEZevenNorth Uist were to be used to determine the UKs EEZ, instead of St Kilda, which is  miles from Rockall.According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in : \"UNCLOS [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] states that a rock or islet, such as Rockall, that cannot sustain human habitation or economic le of its own is not entitled to an exclusive economic zone or a continental shelf, but is entitled to a territorial sea. The UK claims a -nautical mile territorial sea around Rockall\".A -nautical mile territorial sea around Rockall equals  square miles, which is larger than Fe or East Ayrshire or South Ayrshire or Orkney or Shetland.The first literary reference to Rockall is in Martin Martins A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland published in , in which the inhabitants of St Kilda called it \"Rokabarra\".Scotland should not renounce any claim over Rockall as called for by Green MSP Andy Wightman , since by any objective opinion, Rockall belongs to Scotland.Incidentally, Rockall is further west than Ireland and is as far west as parts of mainland Iceland.Thomas Murray,Perth.NEIL Mackay says that the Scottish Government should not tell Irish fishermen to keep out of UK waters. Irish ships have been fishing off Rockall which is an uninhabited rock in the middle of the North Sea. The UK has long laid claim to Rockall as its territory because the closest inhabited land to it is, by far, North Uist. Ireland and Iceland dispute the claim, though their territories are much further away.What Mr Mackay fails to mention, however, is that Rockall is inside the boundary of the UKs Exclusive Economic Zoneand that Ireland and the UK signed an EEZ boundary agreement in . The boundaries have been agreed and Ireland is failing to honour them. It is sheer effrontery by Irish politicians to accuse the UK and Scotland of bullying when the latter have protested about Irish incursions into UK waters.The reasons that Mr Mackay gives to ignore Irish incursions are that Scotland and Ireland are historically Celtic nations and that a future independent Scotland will need Irish support in the EU. In other words, he advises us to let Ireland walk over us now because it might treat us better later on. I do not think many people in Scotland would support such a doormat policy. We expect people to keep to the agreements that they have signed, whether they are Celts, Gaels or some other tribe. Respect should be mutual, rather than one-way.Les Reid,Edinburgh.BOBBY McDonagh, former Irish Ambassador to the UK and EU, said this about the SNPs claymore-rattling over Rockall: \"The SNP Government, whose principal policy is to seek independence, is forcefully asserting its interpretation of UK rights more than the UK Government itself\". I can think of only three possible motives, none of which reflect well on my country..If its a belated sooking-up to Scots fishermen, this text I got from a prominent Aberdeenshire fisherman doesnt suggest its working: \"The Scottish fleet are totally mystied on whatrsquos it all about. It will have an ulterior motive but we have not worked out what yet. The Irish white fish fleet is very small andpossible has been decimated by the EU more than we have. Itrsquos the rest who have raped our waters\"It could be another virtue-signalling attempt to show up Westminster, or a \"power grab\" for a couple of frigates and a big tricorn hat so that Fiona Hyslop can carry out her threat that \"vessels will be deployed to take enforcement action against Irish vessels found fishing within  miles of Rockall\".

The SNP was a minority government so was outvoted and the ruinous Edinburgh trams went ahead, at almost double the budget allocated the good citizens of Edinburgh are left with the cost, and there is an ongoing inquiry as to what went wrong. On its watch it had the Queensferry Crossing, on time and on budget, and is continuing to dual the A. The Aberdeen bypass was completed despite legal hurdles and the main contractor going bust.Problems with the railways are in the main due to the fact that the rail tracks are under the jurisdiction of Westminster, not Holyrood. The Borders Railway was also opened.The new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was opened in Glasgow, and Dumfries Infirmary and Orkney Hospital and healthcare hub were also opened. There are still problems with some of the hospitals built under PFI by Labour, but sorting them out is ruinously expensive.There are also problems with schools built under PFI, so some built in that era have had to be demolished and rebuilt.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"BrewDogs Inverurie bar\"  Neighbours object to BrewDog’s Inverurie pub hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses. It is not for the taxpayer to pick up this bill on their behalf, hence these proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"speed limit backed outside school","story":"Local councillors have supported a motion calling for a part-time mph limit to be made permanent outside Kintore School.Members of the Garioch Area Committee made the decision after its chair Fergus Hood warned the matter “could not wait until a child has been run down” before action was taken.Cllr Hood – along with fellow members Glen Reid and Martin Ford –jointly raised a Members Promoted Issue after local residents raised serious concerns over “signicant speeding” outside the school.By introducing a permanent mph zone – which is against current council policy – it would create the mechanism to have additional traffic-calming measures such as a single speed hump to be installed directly outside the school.Despite admitting that recent recorded speeds during the part-time mph were above the threshold for interventions, roads officials said a full-time mph limit did not meet council criteria.Instead they wanted to see a high-profile enforcement campaign by Police Scotland and greater engagement with the school parent council, parents and local community groups on driving behaviour.A report stated: “There is existing traffic calming in the area that is appropriate for the type of road and includes traffic islands, build-outs, flashing speed limit signage, zebra crossing and a part-time mph limit.”Cllr Reid told the committee that there was clear evidence of “horrendous speeding” on the m stretch of road.Cllr Martin Ford felt the local authority appeared to be “too tolerant” of speeding, insisting that it needed to be more pro-active to get speeds down generally.The motion will be raised at the council’s Infrastructure Service Committee.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police appeal after thefts from Aberdeenshire propertiesviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"BrewDogs Inverurie bar\"  Neighbours object to BrewDog’s Inverurie pub hours viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

Barnes  Noble is the principal American book store company. They have over six hundred stores in the United States, and are a familiar presence in American shopping malls. For some years, though, they have not been doing as well as they might – a familiar story in book-selling. But now they have been acquired by the firm that already owns Waterstones, the UK’s largest book chain. Waterstones also used to have its problems,but then was itself bought by a Russian billionaire. He very wisely decided to appoint as its head a man who had a reputation for being able to sell books – James Daunt, who had built up a small string of highly-regarded book stores in London.James Daunt has the advantage in le – and business – of being one of the most agreeable people one could hope to meet. His approach was to make Waterstones bookshops friendlier, more locally-rooted places. This worked, and Waterstones recovered. Now he is going to New York to rescue Barnes  Noble on behalf of its new owner. He has said that he wants to make their stores nicer. He will probably do just that. If you want to make a business nice, the first step is to install a nice person at the top. But it won’t be easy. This is a story that has a major competitor in the wings, a company to which – and we may as well admit it – we all turn to buy everything from light bulbs to crushed flax seed, shoelaces to … books. It is very simple, and it is cheap. Light bulbs and the like may look after themselves, as their cultural implications are slight , but books are a very dferent matter. If book shops disappear because of the ease with which a website allows one-click transactions, then we shall all be immeasurably poorer. These shops are not just any old store, they are book shops – where words and ideas are laid out for us to explore.Buying a book online is undoubtedly convenient, and there is a place for it, but it does weaken the whole edice of book publication. First and foremost, it concentrates an immense amount of book selling power in the hands of a single provider, even , in theory, anybody can sell a book on line. That means that publishers might be required to give the on-line store deep discounts, and that, of course, means they will feel inclined to publish popular titles that will sell in vast numbers. Poetry, essays, and the like may not get a look-in.But it does more than that. When real bricks and mortar booksellers disappear we are denied the chance to browse. How many times do we enter a bookshop and discover an author we’ve never heard of, or a book that we would never have thought existed but that we feel we would like to read  In a real shop, you can start a le-time love affair with the works of a newly-discovered author, obscure or well-known.Bookshops are having a tough time of it, but the situation in Scotland is alleviated by the tenacity and dedication of many of our independent booksellers. These may be crop up in surprising places. One of the most applauded bookshops in Scotland is in a small Borders town – St Boswells, not a place with a very large population. It was here that Ros de la Hay, a former publisher, and her husband, Bill, set up their Main Street Trading Company. They have now added a deli to their offering, so that people can buy books, sample and purchase salami, and have a cup of coffee all at the same time . Main Street Trading was named Britain’s Best Small Shop in .Similar awards have been won further north, by the Watermill Bookshop in Pitlochry, where Jayne and Kevin Ramage have been enticing Perthshire people into buying books for some years. In St Andrews, Robert Topping, a highly regarded bookseller who has well-loved shops in England, in Ely and Bath, established a bookshop a few years ago. He hand-picks the books they stock in this bibliophile’s heaven. He will shortly be opening a new store in Edinburgh, joining booksellers such as Marie Moser, who runs Holy Corner’s gem, the Edinburgh Bookshop. These people are heroes and heroines of the book.These local bookshops, intimate in scale in an age of the big and the characterless, are little fortresses dedicated to defending an artefact that survives because we love it so much – the book. Electronic books are all very well, but you can’t touch the text you can’t smell the paper you can’t put it on a shelf to remind you of what it says you can’t wrap it up and give it as a present you can’t kiss its cover in gratitude. Actual bookshops survive because we love the physicality of the book – and want a real, physical existence rather than a virtual one. Still.

Here, in a town trademarked by its cantilever cranes and red-bricked rows of warehouses, nature reasserts her authority as the yawning expanse of the Firth of Clyde is foreshadowed by Gourock and framed by the rolling hills of Kilcreggan and Dunoon. It is an outlook which only improves during the summer months, and not on account of the erratic west coast weather the enhancement is provided entirely by the reassuring sight of the Waverley’s raked twin funnels coming into view, as she chugs down past the Tail O’ The Bank. From a distance, she appears a mere speck in the Clyde’s dull leaden-blue waters, almost insignicant against the grand canvas provided by Tom na h-Airidh and Ben Bowie. Yet all it takes for the roles to be reversed is a simple change of perspective. Stepping aboard the Waverley is to enter a world of sensory delights, a world which renders all outside it small and insignicant. Vast piston rods and cranks chatter away in unison, thrumming deep below right up against the soles of your feet. Above deck, a churn of gulls hangs expectantly over a comforting fug of hot oil and cold beer. She reserves the best, however, for when she is in full flow, as the unrelenting rhythm of her paddles scoop through the sea, an unstoppable force of industrial ingenuity thrashing ever forward through the years. Or so we hoped. The world’s last seagoing paddle steamer has been a fondly received visitor to communities scattered throughout Scotland’s western waterways for decades. When Caledonian MacBraynesensed that the days of folk heading “doon the watter” were numbered, they sold her in  for £to the Scottish branch of the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. No doubt there are some within CalMac who came to regret that decision, but equally, it would be a mistake to mock them for some perceived folly. The Waverley had lost several sailing days the previous two summer season to boiler problems, and the commercial case for her continued service was increasingly dficult to justy. CalMac, mindful of the ship’s heritage, presumed the society would tend to her in her dotage as a static attraction. Here we are, some  years and six million passengers later. The question in  is, having performed one resurrection, can she repeat the trick The boiler problems which troubled the grand old lady back then, and sporadically ever since,are now altogether more grave. The inner casings of the vast, oil-filled structures are damaged beyond repair. Their replacement is a process the steamship’s custodians liken to “open heart surgery,” and it will be expensive to boot. Waverley Steam Navigation Co Ltd, the charity set up to preserve the ship in operating condition, is hoping to raise £ million so that she canto service next summer. As Paul Semple, the general manager, concedes, it will be a “signicant struggle”. And yet for all the strain of the annual upkeep costs in the face of rising fuel costs and a stricter regulatory environment, there is undoubtedly a sound economic argument to ensure the Waverley stays afloat for years to come. The charity points out that the Waverley’s visits throughout Scotland, as well as to England and Wales, generates more than £.m for the UK economy each year. It is an impressive figure, and its real value lies in where the money goes. By virtue of the Waverley’s long-established routes to Scotland’s islands and sea lochs, she and her patrons call at small, rural communities which once thrummed with activity in their Victorian summer heydays. The Waverley alone cannot turn back the clock and fully restore their lustre, but when she arrives at one their piers teeming with  hungry and thirsty punters onboard, it is a cheering sight for local businesses. Just ask the staff in the Golfers, one of Rothesay’s great wee howffs, who can barely pull pints quickly enough to meet the demand as the tourists come ashore or those in the bustling Zaoni’s chippy, just a hop, skip, and stagger away from the boozer — ideal for those Waverley apostles in pursuit of the last fish supper before their beloved steamer sets sail for Glasgow. Of course, there are some who believe the Waverley’s proud heritage could be preserved without the expense and exertion of rendering her seaworthy once more. Those who envisage her as a floating visitor attraction would do well to look to Calornia, where the Queen Mary has been allowed to fester and decay under the watch of reckless municipal landlords. But the argument for permanently mooring the Waverley is built on deeper fault lines. It singularly fails to acknowledge how the only reason the ship is still with us at all is due to the hard work of generations of impassioned volunteers who simply refused to countenance the idea that the blast of her steam whistle would fall silent..We can, and should, rattle some cages to save an icon of Scotland’s maritime heritage, but it is a battle that will be easier won by remembering the Waverley is no museum piece. Her beauty lies in her . She wears her blood, sweat, and oil with pride.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu citizens in scotland feel unwelcome due to brexit divide","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...EU citizens in Scotland have suffered an #increase in discrimination# and now feel #unwanted and #unwelcome# #as a result of the Brexit ide, a new study has found.Scotland’s reputation as a “welcoming and friendly” is now being undermined over the treatment faced by many of the , EU citizens living in the country, according to the report by Robert Gordon University.It raises concerns about the impact on the mental health of EU citizens north of the border and calls for action to tackle this at a national and local level.Scottish Government Europe Minister Ben Macpherson admitted the findings are “hard to hear” but put the uncertainty down to UK Government policies on residency status and other rights.The report, entitled How Brexit Impacts EU Citizens’ Mental Health And Wellbeing Research Findings, finds the political isions in recent years have had a stark impact on EU citizens. “The Brexit campaign, referendum, and subsequent political discourse have damaged EU citizens’ wellbeing primarily through undermining their integration into Scottish society,” its states“They have been left feeling unwanted, unwelcome, marked out as dferent and treated as inferior. They are concerned with the uncertainty around Brexit, reducing their ability to visualise their future in Scotland. “Most saw Scotland and the UK as open, welcoming countries before the  referendum, increasing their sense of shock and loss.”It adds: “For some, this rejection materialised as an increase in discrimination.”Scotland has a “critical advantage” over the rest of the UK given its ‘Remain’ majority in , but still faces challenges, the report adds.About , live in Scotland, making up .% of the Scottish population. Roughly half of all EU citizens in Scotland are Polish or Irish.Mr Macpherson said: “It is hard to hear that the EU citizens in this study have been left feeling unwanted and unwelcome as a result of Brexit, and because of the UK Government’s policies regarding their residency status and other rights.“It is clear that the real impact of Brexit is being felt by people on a personal level across the country, and none more so than EU citizens who have done us the honour of making Scotland their home. That is why we have launched the Stay in Scotland campaign, to encourage and support EU citizens to stay here. We will continue to do all we can to support EU citizens in Scotland through these uncertain times.”The study, a collaboration between RGU and Feniks – a charity aiming to improve the wellbeing of the Central Eastern European Community in Edinburgh – aimed to analyse how this seismic change in British politics is shaping the lives of the communities most affected.Piotr Teodorowski, a researcher involved in the study said: “Many EU citizens now feel unwelcome and rejected, with some reporting experiences of discrimination. This, coupled with feelings of being marked out as dferent, disenfranchised, and disempowered, express the anxiety felt by EU citizens in Scotland as a result of Brexit. “The underlying argument we can draw from this research is that the mental health of EU citizens is important, not only in its own right, but as a barometer of integration and cohesion in Scotland. We hope these results will help to stimulate debate on how EU citizens in Scotland can be supported and how to enhance cohesion in Scottish society.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

You clearly misunderstood my point, which related to democracy.Clarity is a desirable quality of communication, in itself, neutral. As opposed to democracy, which is a fundamental principle by which we live and are governed.John.Firstly, I neither swore nor used “foul” language.I just failed to prissy it up to the required standard.I didn’t say anything you wouldn’t hear in a nursery playground. Secondly.I did understand what you said but you clearly didn’t understand it yourself.In your example, a party was standing in what was essentially a single-issue election and stated its policy with clarity and precision.Given these very specic factors, under what circumstances would this party be elected by voters who did not support the policy In order to justy your “honouring, then ignoring the plebs” insult, you created a  scenario.Incidentally.It shouldn’t make any dference but when I replied to your comment, I had no party axe to grind.No, Malcolm, it is you, not I, who fail to understand. My point referred to the LibDems conduct during and after the EU referendum # #People#s Vote# # of  June . The recent EU election is merely the latest episode.The Remain-supporting UK government sent a £ million, taxpayer funded leaflet to every UK home, recommending Remain and stating # in big, bold type # that this was a #once in a generation# event, adding, #The government will implement whatever you decide.#No party dissented. Indeed, Nick Clegg repeated it forcefully in a nationwide tv debate .The next day, LibDems leader Tim Farron furiously rejected the outcome . Since then, the LibDems, and others, have campaigned ferociously to reverse the result.They have traipsed around Brussels, encouraging EU negotiators while undermining our own, effectively, #colluding with a foreign power# to wreck Brexit. And all the while demanding a second referendum in which the people would be frightened into voting Remain by the unpalatable EU offer that they helped to ensure.I am unable to recognise that as in any way democratic.John,The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. The Liberals adopted a pro-European stance in the  advisory referendum as did the Lib Dems in the  advisory referendum.They also presented pro-European policies in all the national and European elections between those dates and up to the present.Their MPs and MEPs have been consistently elected by pro-European voters who expect them to stick to their pro-European election manestoes.There are countless dferent types of constitutional democracies around the World and they are all slightly dferent.If you watch events in the House of Commons, you will notice that there are neat rows of benches provided opposite the government’s benches.They have been there for hundreds of years and they are there for a very special reason.They exist because, in our form of constitutional democracy, the losing side is allowedto continue developing and promoting the positions set out in its own manestoes.The losing parties do this in direct opposition to the policies of the government who were elected by the majority.That is why the losing parties are called “The Opposition” and their existence is not something that contradicts democracy but is, in fact, an essential part of it.You can’t expect the opposition parties to take a vow of silence just because someone put a leaflet through your letterbox in .#The fact that a party agrees to hold a referendum or participate in an election does not mean it has to change its stance after the results are announced. #But the least they should do is respect the result, not demand it is overturned.Ok., Malcolm, I seem to be having dficulty making it through the editorial filter so I#ll have to agree to disagree.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in .

It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy statements in my name falsified exarmy doctor tells inquest","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Yesterday he told the Ballymurphy inquest he was \"astonished\" by Army and police statements purporting to have been made by him in . \"I am certain I did not make these statements or perform the surgery referred to,\" he said. \"Even though it was  years ago my memories have not faded, they have been etched in my mind indelibly.\" The witness pointed to several \"glaring mistakes\" as he insisted he did not treat either of two men fatally shot on August , . The statements claimed M certied the death of John Laverty and performed major surgery on a severely wounded Joseph Corr, who subsequently died of his injuries. But the witness told the inquest that in hindsight \"it was an absurdity\" that he was ever put in the post in the military wing of Musgrave Park Hospital. \"I do not know how the MoD justied it,\" he said. M concluded that the only explanation was that someone  wrote the statements as he said it \"beggars belief\" that he had simply forgotten the events outlined in the documents. \"I want the relatives of Mr Corr to know I didnt operate on him. I was an inexperienced surgeon, I couldnt have done it.\"The witness said Mr Corrs injuries were so severe that it is inconceivable that he would have attempted the surgery without any memory of doing so. He also dismissed the idea that other medics were standing by and watching someone so inexperienced attempt to carry out the surgery.\"Some things are impossible. This was not a one-man band,\" he added.M also denied ever meeting Mr Corrs widow Eileen Corr, as she claimed in a statement which was read to the court. In it she claimed she met the medic when she visited her husband in the hospital and that he briefed her on his condition, warning that he was unlikely to come back off the operating table.\"I am not casting aspersions on her memory, but she was under enormous stress after suffering a terrible loss,\" the witness said. M said he only joined the Army as a second lieutenant in  to make money after graduating from a three-year university course. \"I was one of four children and my father was a parson,\" he explained. \"We didnt have much means and it was an attractive way to finance myself.\" He was promoted to lieutenant and then again to the rank of captain once he became a fully registered medic in .The doctor claimed he was \"left alone\" by the Army and was never briefed on the situation in Northern Ireland before being sent here. He described the single unit military wing as a \"Florence Nightingale-type of ward\" which lacked facilities including basic intensive care equipment. \"There was no anaesthetist in the wing and I dont recallit had its own operating theatre,\" he added. \"Its dficult to understand how it was intended toas a surgical unit.\"M also questioned why the MoD has been unable to provide the names of other medics, including an Army major, who were stationed in the hospital."},{"url":null,"title":"how june went from sizzling to drizzling in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the time Translink also had to reduce the speed of its trains as a precaution to prevent tracks from buckling in the extreme heat.On a more positive note, Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts said Northern Ireland escaped the yellow warning in place yesterday across England, Scotland and Wales, which brought flood warnings.But she cautioned the coming weeks would remain unsettled for us and to expect a few showers today - although skies could clear in the afternoon and early evening to make way for brighter spells.\"It is likely to be a day of sunshine and showers,\" she added. \"It will be a decent start, but showers breaking out until the early afternoon and will be fairly hit and miss.\"With a lingering low pressure, Ms Roberts warned that Saturday and Sunday are set for more unsettled weather with outbreaks of heavy rain.\"It is a big contrast to last June, but it does seem there will be brighter spells with less rain as time goes on,\" she said.\"All we can look at are the trends, there are some signals well get something brighter in the southern parts of the UK.\"But for Northern Ireland, it will remain fairly unsettled for June, thats not to say there wont be some brighter spells at times.\"Temperatures have been slightly lower than average this week at around -C due to a band of low pressure making its way across Ireland and Britain, the meteorologist explained.

Mr Simpson criticised the youngest Moderator since  for having \"spurned the traditional robes of office\".The  General Assembly at Church House in Belfast was attended by up to , ministers and elders from the Churchs congregations across Ireland. It voted overwhelmingly by  to  not to accept a request from the South Belfast Presbytery to rescind last years decision on ending the link with Scotland, and to allow a full debate next year in the hope that such visits would be resumed from .Mr Simpson added: \"As I watched I became more and more disappointed. I have a real fondness for the Church and I loved my time in it, but Im just incredibly saddened to see what it has become.\"The Assembly used to be an occasion of relevance and dignity. Today its become irrelevant to modern le. When they look at themselves they see only righteous virtue and are possessed with the uncanny ability to see the flaws in others.\"The fact that Queens University withdrew its support for Union College was, of course, totally the fault of the university. \"How could they possibly not see that Union Theological College was staffed by top-class liberal thinking academics who refused to take a narrow view of theology and were totally pro-women  And all this time we still hear the pitter-patter of feet walking away.\"Mr Simpson said he now fears for the future. He added: \"The Presbyterian Church as I knew it is finished and theres now going to be a great dficulty in hanging on to the normal, sensible members who are continuing to drt away. I feel sorry for the many, many decent people who dont know where to go and are afraid to speak up.\"This should have been a real opportunity to show that the Presbyterian Church was willing to listen, learn and prepare for the future. Instead that future looks bleak. Instead the Presbyterian Church continues to project blame onto everyone but itself. What is wrong with examining yourself for you faults and addressing them  \"Instead they remain oblivious to their faults. This fundamentalist lot will only succeed in one thing - and thats attracting clones of themselves. But in turn they will drive away people who think liberally, value dissent, are open to light from all sources and can live with uncertainty and doubt.\"The Presbyterian Church did not wish to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Iran has denied being involved, but it comes as Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen have also launched missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.Commander Joshua Frey, a Fth Fleet spokesman, said the US navy was assisting the two vessels that he described as being hit in a “reported attack”.He did not say how the ships were attacked or who was suspected of being behind the assault.Dryad Global, a maritime intelligence firm, preliminarily identied one of the vessels involved as the MT Front Altair, a Marshall Islands-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel was “on fire and adrt”, Dryad added. The firm that operates the Front Altair told the Associated Press that an explosion was the cause of the fire onboard.

BSM Ship Management said it sustained hull damage and  sailors had been evacuated, with one suffering minor injuries.Iranian state television said  sailors from the two tankers have been transferred to an Iranian port in the southern province of Hormozgan.The timing of Thursday’s reported attack was especially sensitive as Mr Abe’s high-stakes diplomacy mission was under way in Iran. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shinzo Abe shakes hands with Hassan Rouhani at the Saadabad Palace On Wednesday, after talks with Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, Mr Abe warned that any “accidental conflict” that could be sparked amid the heightened US-Iran tensions must be avoided.His message came just hours after Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi airport, striking its arrivals hall before dawn and wounding  people.Mr Abe met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday, the second and final day of his visit. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga, a top government spokesman, told reporters that Mr Abe’s trip was intended to help de-escalate tensions in the Middle East – but not specically mediate between Tehran and Washington.His remarks were apparently meant to downplay and lower expectations amid uncertain prospects for Mr Abe’s mission.Tensions have escalated in the Middle East as Iran appears poised to break the  nuclear deal with world powers, an accord that the Trump administration pulled out of last year.Iran’s nuclear deal, reached in  by China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the US, saw Tehran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lting of crippling sanctions. Western powers feared Iran’s atomic programme could allow it to build nuclear weapons, although Iran has long insisted its programme was for peaceful purposes.In withdrawing from the deal last year, US President Donald Trump pointed to the accord not limiting Iran’s ballistic missile programme and not addressing what American officials describe as Tehran’s malign influence across the wider Middle East. Those who struck the deal at the time described it as a building block towards further negotiations with Iran, whose Islamic government has had a tense relationship with America since the  takeover of the US embassy in Tehran and subsequent hostage crisis.Already, Iran says it quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, US sanctions have cut off opportunities for Iran to trade its excess uranium and heavy water abroad, putting Tehran on course to violate terms of the nuclear deal regardless."},{"url":null,"title":"indias west coast braced as cyclone vayu approaches","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She was also the founder of the human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights-a group that supported disadvantaged groups which she continued to advise until her death.Inez Murphy was born into the Protestant tradition in Cultra, County Down in September,  and after her initial studies won a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at -years-old whilst working towards her A levels at night.At this tender age the budding champion of trade unionism didn’t fully appreciate what was actually happening in Northern Ireland and later recalled: “I was a puzzled young Prod. Until I was , I hadn’t knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn’t understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and ision in our society.”Inez McCormack’s first contact with Derry came in the years - when she attended Magee College. It was the era when the decision to locate Northern Ireland’s second university at Coleraine. The experience provided her with her first taste of ‘street politics’ and an initial glimpse at how power was abused. Between - she attended Trinity College in Dublin and it was there that she met Vincent McCormack.The pair married within three months of meeting and as her husband was a founding member of the Derry Labour Party, when they ed to Derry Inez had a first-hand insight of the growing Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. She was on the People’s Democracy march that was attacked at Burntollet by loyalists as it approached Derry in January,  and later described the era as “living through a historical defining moment.”Later in , having begun to study for a Diploma in Social Studies Inez McCormack began a career as a social worker in Ballymurphy, in . The West Belfast housing estate, ravaged by the Troubles also suffered great levels of social deprivation and in the midst of that an attempt was made to shut the Social Services office down and the workers were to be moved to a dferent area.Realising the need for them to stay the workers refused to leave Ballymurphy and they were advised to join a trade union to help them resist the pressure to go. Inez McCormack contacted the National Union of Public Employeesand all the workers were accepted as member with Inez acting as shop steward. By , she was working part-time for the union.NUPE would eventually become UNISON and in , Inez McCormack became the first female full-time official with the daunting task of achieving , members in the first five months of her employment.Realising that part-time women workers in the public sector were normally dismissed as ‘too dficult to organise’ and so weren’t part of a union, Inez McCormack began the process of signing them up.She said: “My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody.\"By the time UNISON was formed in  Inez had increased the union’s membership from  to ,. She went in to become the union’s first woman regional secretary and continued to represent low-paid women cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. Between - she was the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU and became its first woman president in .Inez McCormack’s achievements were all the more remarkable coming as they did in a very male dominated world. But those achievements did not come lightly.\"At one meeting I was booed off the  and called scum.

The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in , and brought the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in the North.In the build-up to the  Belfast Agreement saw the adopted Derry woman running a brilliant campaign to have equality and human rights provisions included. Inez McCormack viewed this as being key to conflict resolution founded on the practice of justice.She saw that those most affected by violence in the North came from the most socially deprived communities. So, Inez McCormack’s campaign asserted the rights of the most socially excluded and she said: “Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions. I argue that a lot of the social problems come because the economy is built in a way that excludes people rather than includes.”The next landmark in Inez McCormack’s long list of achievements came in  when she set up participation and Practice of Rights . This is a Belfast group which supports marginalised groups in using a practical and unique human rights-based approach to tackle the social and economic challenges they experience. Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as \"ground breaking,\" saying, \"They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive sense of rights and dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application where.”McCormack was a founding member of the Vital Voices Global Advisory Council, and honoured in  at Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in recognition of her contributions as a human rights advocate. The international organisation supports and invests in emerging women leaders in harnessing their potential to bring about peace and prosperity in their communities.She was also appointed in  by the Irish government as the independent chair of a consultative process to develop an Irish National Action Plan to meet government obligations under the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.McCormack received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate from Queens University Belfast in  for her services to human rights and the community. She received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from New York City in , the Aisling Person of the Year Community Award in , and the Irish Tatler Women of the Year Award in .McCormack was also a well-known writer and broadcaster, and her work has been featured in a number of television programmes and documentaries. Numerous articles by McCormack on the theme of underpinning building peace and prosperity by inclusive socio-economic strategies have been published in recent years, and some of her work was included in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing .McCormacks career was featured in the  American documentary play Seven. The play, developed by Vital Voices, spotlights seven women from across the world that have overcame obstacles to bring major changes in their home countries. Meryl Streep portrayed McCormack. When the women portrayed were asked to come on stage and stand beside their onstage likenesses, Streep stated that she \"felt slight\" while standing beside McCormack, adding, \"Im an actress and she is the real deal.\"In , Newsweek named McCormack as one of its \" women who shake the world,\" the only Northern Irish woman to be named as such.The documentary, Inez McCormack: A Challenging Woman, produced and narrated by Susan McKay, won best short documentary award at the Galway Film Fleadh in .Inez McCormack had lived in Derry since .

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story. The chief organiser, Mr Paddy McAteer, said he was stunned by the huge turnout.ldquoThe walk was a tremendous success with a record number of starters and a high number of people who completed the trek, he said. ldquoThis walk is undoubtedly getting bigger and bigger and it is amazing to see people from all walks of le coming together.The walkers were supported by a range number of voluntary route marshals.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive. This makes it impossible to announce when production will start, he added.CROSSGAR mdash Mr Edward Cargo, from Crossgar, retired this week after  years of service to transport and received an inscribed gold watch from his colleagues to mark the occasion.Mr Cargo, who was based at Downpatrick bus station, received his gold watch from the station manager, Mr Ian Cunningham, at a specialheld in the Slaney Inn, Raholp.Mr Cunningham, who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Cargorsquos colleagues at the Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch Ulsterbus depots, thanked him for his long and distinguished service in transport, starting with the old Northern Ireland Road Transport Authority and finally Ulsterbus.Mr Jim Prior, on behalf of the engineering department, wished Mr Cargo a long and happy retirement and thanked him for all the help and friendship he gave to all the men in the garage over the years.SAINTFIELD mdash Preparations for the th annual Saintfield and District Agricultural Show have been finalised and the organisers are hoping for good weather to ensure big crowds.Entries for the agricultural, home industry and poultry sections are very high.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17673697.superhero-and-mum-sarah-griffiths-launches-new-book/resources/images/9976346.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South West College studying BTEC Level  Diploma in Business completed their final pitches last week in front of a  of lsquoDragonsrsquo.A Dragonsrsquo Den simulated task was the concluding element of a yearlong project that required them to develop inidual business ideas, conduct market research, and compose financial forecasts.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Traffic delays as emergency services at scene of accident Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

It’s one of the areas that people have the lowest opinion of and the lowest expectations for. Duncairn Centres arts and events manager Ray Gfen“That’s the fuel in our tank, to change that and show how quality arts-led programming can impact that. It also lets the funders out there see the benefits of arts and creativity in changing society.”The arts centre is located in a predominantly nationalist area of the Antrim Road in the former Duncairn Presbyterian Church, which provides an inspiring backdrop for those within the building.This weekend will mark the second visit of RTE’s Other Voices to the centre. One of the highlights will be an acoustic performance to less than  competition winners from multi award-winning Northern Ireland band Snow Patrol on Saturday evening.The Duncairn Centre is run by the  Trust – a Christian community development group set up in . Presbyterian minister Rev Bill Shaw OBE has been the trust’s director since .Ray said: “We knew we had a good starting point in that Bill and the  Trust were highly respected here.“This is a long game. I’d say in the first year there would have been % coming from the PUL community, the rest would have been locals . “Just last year, it was up to around about -% from the PUL community. That was through programming, running specic events and targeting groups.

We needed to go all in with this. I’m extremely proud of the work we’re doing here. We’re punching well above our weight.”He added: “Our organisation – the  Trust – is very much rooted in peace and reconciliation. “Both Bill and I are passionate about arts, and community building using arts and creativity as a vehicle to bring people together.“I think he and I are a good starting point. We come from completely dferent backgrounds.” Bill is a Presbyterian minister who was awarded an OBE for services to the community in north Belfast, while Ray comes from the nationalist community and from a family of musicians and music lovers.Ray said: “We get on extremely well. What lies at the heart of that relationship is that we love people and we want to give people a chance to shine.“We don’t ask people where they come from or what their political views are. “We are Belfast right to the very marrow of our bones. We love the city, the people, warts and all.”With the help of funding the Duncairn Centre has grown into a hub of music, arts and creativity hosting regular concerts, discussions and workshops led by artists in residence.Ray said: “A lot of what we do is about music. Music is the one thing that is relevant to everyone in every walk of le. It’s got the power to bring people together.“I look at the creative community as a moral compass because they think dferently, creatively, imaginatively, about how to overcome problems. Artists don’t really do barriers to collaboration, they celebrate dference.“We encourage discourse, but the one thing that is required is respect. Respect has to be earned through people’s actions and how they deal with each other.”Of the centre’s ethos Ray said: “We’re more than just an arts centre. It’s easy just to set a programme of classes. What makes us dferent is the thought, the follow up, the support, the empathy that underlies all of that.

I have to say I am not confident as things stand the current Labour leadership would know how to solve this crisis either,” he said.Billy McKee death: IRA victims lament lack of remorse and continuation of bitterness Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I.

A no confidence motion would have to be tabled with  daysrsquo notice.It is understood the saga around the transfer of Llancarfan Primary School to Rhoose, described by many as a ldquoclosure, was a driving factor behind Conservatives calling for Cllr Thomasrsquo departure.Cllr Thomasrsquo cabinet approved the controversial move despite opposition from parents and campaigners and criticism from one cabinet member, Councillor Gordon Kemp.Cllr Kemp was eventually sacked from the cabinet after joining  Conservative councillors who abstained on voting for the administrationrsquos budget.The LDRS is also aware of ldquoserious discontent from several of Cllr Thomasrsquo backbenchers over a number of ldquoPR blunders, including proposed car parking charges throughout the Vale.Cllr Bailey, who is the current chairman of the councilrsquos environment and regeneration scrutiny committee, has been on the authority since the  after gaining the Dyfan ward in Barry for the Conservatives from Labour.Cllr Bailey said:ldquoI would firstly like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to John Thomas, who has worked exceptionally hard for the Vale of Glamorgan during his time as leader of the council and the Conservative Group.ldquoI would like to thank him for all of his help and support, I look forward to working with him and other colleagues as we move forward.ldquoThe Vale is a fantastic place, and fellow councillors and I look forward to delivering a bright and prosperous future for all our residents.ldquoIt is a huge honour to have been elected group leader, following a vote at the annual general meeting of the Conservative Group.ldquoThe council and its employees exist to serve local people, and moving forward our priorities must include delivering progress on the Dinas Powys By-Pass, revisiting decisions to introduce car parking charges and close Llancarfan School, and looking again at the options to improve transport links between the A and J of the M.Cllr Thomas was elected to represent the St Athan ward in , and has been leader of the authority since May .A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoCllr John Thomas continues to be leader of the Vale of Glamorgan CouncilldquoThere has been one change to the councilrsquos political executive. Cllr Bob Penrose has resigned from his position as cabinet member for learning and culture. This post is currently vacant. The councilrsquos cabinet remains otherwise unchanged.ldquoThe meeting of full council on May  will go ahead as planned.ldquoHowever, the resignation of two members of the Conservative group has caused the postponement of the councilrsquos annual general meeting scheduled for May .ldquoAt the AGM there is a discussion around the allocation of committee seats and chairmanships of committees. There is currently uncertainty as to how committee seats will be allocated.ldquoIt is therefore appropriate to postpone the AGM so that the council can properly plan for that meeting and so that decisions can be made based on up-to-date political calculations. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The final recommendations fail to reflect the need clearly identied in the exercise.The GAA is the largest sporting organisation in our Borough yet in the Craigavon area ABC council provides  pitches for soccer and zero for GAA. The one pitch cited in the report as council-owned and suitable for GAA is located in Portadown, in a public park and open for use to a number of other sports. “As a council we rightly provide pitches to soccer, cricket, hockey and American football teams but in the Craigavon area we offer no provision to our huge GAA community. The GAA section of the report includes a continuous reference to Sport England and Rugby Football Union guidance which begs the question as to what consultation actually took place with the GAA.The failure to equality proof this policy is of major concern,” said Cllr Nelson who asked for the report to be pulled. She said she was ‘stunned’ when the SDLP proposed the recommendations be accepted. The strategy went through with the support of the SDLP, UUP, DUP and Alliance.”Craigavon SDLP Cllr Declan McAlinden said: “Sinn Fein put forward a proposal to have an Equality Impact Assessment on the council’s play pitch strategy after having sat for three years developing the proposal without once questioning the process.“Theirmotive is unknown but their proposal doesn’t have the support of the Ulster GAA council, local clubs or schools. In fact, their proposal would only have delayed the implementation of the plans, and potentially put at risk, the existing developments.”Doug Beattie MLA promoted to major in the Royal Irish

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
