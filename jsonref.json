She managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.The alleged incident was one of several unwanted advances made towards the woman by Ihsan between January and April last year after he rented the property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.The GP was subsequently asked to leave by the managers at the apartment block after the woman complained.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the housekeeper had been employed to clean various flats at the complex where Ihsan had taken out a lease on a serviced property.Lawyers for the General Medical Council Helena Duong told the Manchester hearing: \u0027She was responsible for cleaning his room and on a number of occasions, he was present when she was cleaning the room.\u0027On one incident in her statement she went to the room to collect her keys which she had left behind and Dr Ihsan opened the door with a towel around his waist.          Dr Mohammed Ihsan, 36, approached the woman whilst he was dressed only in a towel around his waist and told her: \u0027I\u0027m looking for some fun,\u0027 it is alleged\u0027After she retrieved her keys, he dropped his towel and exposed his bottom in her sight. The next incident happened about a week after this when she was making his bed sheets.\u0027He came behind her and he put his bottom on top of hers. She describes feeling uncomfortable and moving away.\u0027About three weeks later, she was cleaning the room and she walked past his en-suite bathroom and he was using the shower and his door was open. We say he did this on purpose to expose himself to her.\u0027On April 4, while Ms A was cleaning his room, she went to get some things from the trolley outside and when she returned she saw Dr Ihsan with a towel around his waist. He said to her that they had \u0027chemistry\u0027 and he locked the door.\u0027He pushed her into the corner and said that he \u0027wanted to have fun\u0027 but she said that she is \u0027not that type of person\u0027.

She managed to break free and unlock the door and escape. These are unwanted sexual advancements towards Ms A.\u0027Following the alleged incidents the housekeeper became nervous when she was about to clean Ihsan\u0027s room but at first did not tell her partner about the incidents.She later broke down in tears and told him when she said she wanted to get a new job. She subsequently told her manager who then rang police on her behalf. Another manager later got in contact with Ihsan and suggested he move out.In a statement Ms A said: \u0027I didn\u0027t want to tell my partner because I know he would go mad and would not let me go back into work.\u0027When asked how she did eventually tell him she replied: \u0027Yes I said to him how I got a bit upset at work and asked whether he remembered me telling him about that doctor. I said there was a bit of an incident again where he put his hands down the back of my trousers.\u0027Recalling one incident she said: \u0027I was situated with my back to the wardrobe. He bent over to open the wardrobe and his bottom touched mine. He did not say sorry for his bottom touching mine.\u0027Describing another she said: \u0027He came out and stood behind me and he was very close. I went a bit further up the door. He came up to me and locked the door so I pushed myself further up the door.\u0027She agreed with Miss Duong when she put it to Ms A: \u0027You say that the towel drops and Dr Ihsan exposes himself and then you say that he makes some other comments to you and then you say that you pushed him away against his bare chest.\u0027You then tell us about your phone ringing. You told him it was your boss calling. He replied that there were not any cameras in the room but you said that your boss would know that you were in there and you quickly unlocked the front door.\u0027In November last year Ihsan was suspended for nine months after being found guilty of misconduct.He quizzed a patient about her sex life during a routine appointment, and he told a second patient he was \u0027horny\u0027 and asked to see her bottom at his surgery in South Kirby, Wakefield.  At the time Dr Ihsan said he acknowledged the seriousness of his actions and was sorry for what had happened. Ihsan, from Huddersfield, denies sexually motivated misconduct. The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/19/4E59435100000578-5962673-image-a-5_1531852368038.jpg","title":"School staff inadvertently record foul mouthed chat autistic pupil mothers VOICEMAIL","story":"Leighanne Bromley, 29, heard foul-mouthed school staff insult her autistic son in a voicemail message after they thought they had hung up          Ms Bromley said: \u0027I was gobsmacked and horrified someone who is entrusted with my son\u0027s care had that attitude towards him\u0027          Three Spires Academy headteacher Robert Jones has issued an apology to Ms BromleySchool told girl, 13, to ¿move on with her life¿ after she...Man who took 11-year-old Thai girl as his wife denies he did...Share this articleShe said instead the school proposed a verbal warning for the man and a written warning for the woman.Ms Bromley added: \u0027I asked if they could move him temporarily into another class so he is away from the people involved but they poo pooed the idea.\u0027I\u0027m left in an impossible situation where I don\u0027t want to send him in but I could get in trouble if I don\u0027t.\u0027I\u0027m still sending him but I\u0027m not happy and nervous about how he\u0027s being treated but I feel I don\u0027t have a choice.\u0027Ms Bromley said she felt compelled to make the recording public after the school sent a text to parents warning of a possible negative news story being reported.The text went on to say the matter was under investigation and was not a safeguarding concern.

The Dare Stone (either side is pictured) – named because it is believed to be written by Eleanor White Dare, Roanoke Governor John White\u0027s daughter – was found  on the North Carolina-Virginia border          In a recent study done by Brenau University, who owns the Dare Stone, a small part of it was cut off for an analysis of the chemicals and minerals present. The elements they found have helped determine where in Virginia the stone is likely from. However, more work is needed to figure out if the stone is a forgery or notMorrison heard about the Dare Stones for the first time 11 years ago, during his first week on the job at the university.\u0027I had never heard of them and I was sitting at my desk one day and I got an email message from somebody that wanted to know why we were hiding away these valuable artifacts in a 16th century mausoleum and wanted to know why,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com.\u0027It was kind of odd because there was no Georgia in the 16th century, let alone Brenau University with a mausoleum,\u0027 he says. The state of Georgia was founded in 1732 and the university in 1878.Soon after the accusatory email, Morrison says he got dozens of other inquiries from people who wanted to take rubbings of the Dare Stones. He found out that was a scavenger hunt task created to promote the 400th anniversary celebration of Jamestown. He also found out who sent that first email.Los Angeles police hunt for USC PhD student, 22, who...¿She was murdered¿: Cold case breakthrough as police find...Rare and unseen pictures of The Who taken by super-fan who...Share this article    The Lost Colony of Roanoke has captured the world\u0027s imagination for hundreds of years, in some ways particularly because among the missing colonists is the first English child to be born in the New World, Virginia Dare (pictured in a woodcut in \u0027North Carolina Illustrated\u0027 in Harperís New Monthly Magazine, 1857)He adds later: \u0027It\u0027s just a good story is what happened to that colony. You could simplify it and say they signed everybody up saying well we\u0027re trying to start a colony at that location several times and it hasn\u0027t worked out because it\u0027s just too dangerous. If the Indians don\u0027t get you, the weather will… and that\u0027s probably what happened to them, one or the other. And so, mystery solved. But that\u0027s not good enough. People really want to know the whole story.\u0027After two other groups had previously landed at Roanoke Island – the first to explore and chart the area in 1584 and the second to unsuccessfully attempt a colony in 1586 before returning to England a year later – Governor John White led a group of about 115 men, women and children, including his pregnant daughter Eleanor White Dare, to the site in 1587. Several weeks after they landed there on August 18, Eleanor gave birth to the first English baby born in the New World and named her Virginia Dare.Governor White soon returned to England to ask for more supplies, but he was held up in England for three years while the English warred with Spain. When he was finally able to make it back in 1590 on his granddaughter\u0027s third birthday, Roanoke was empty. Houses were dismantled and there wasn\u0027t a person in sight. There was also no sign of their agreed-upon emergency symbol: a cross. The only hints at the colonists\u0027 whereabouts were the letters \u0027Cro\u0027 carved on a tree and the word \u0027Croatoan\u0027 carved on a gatepost.Croatoan was an island south of Roanoke as well as the name of a Native American tribe who had befriended the colonists, according to a new book about Roanoke called The Secret Token by Andrew Lawler. According to his notes, Governor White was relieved to know the colonists were safe.Bad weather conditions prevented White from going to the second island and he was instead forced to return to England. The Roanoke colonists were never seen again.The mystery has sparked plenty of theories, both realistic and outlandish. Plausible theories suggest they died from disease, were massacred by either Native Americans or Spanish settlers or assimilated into a nearby Native American tribe, either as friends or slaves. More fantastic theories include alien abductions or death by zombie apocalypse.Twenty years after Roanoke was founded, the more successful colony of Jamestown was settled 100 miles north in Virginia by the Virginia Company of London in 1607. Though this colony was threatened with failure after two years of disease, famine and conflict, a second group of settlers in 1610 ensured Jamestown\u0027s success.          The Lost Colony of Roanoke\u0027s mystery became popular in 1937 when then-President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated a commemorative stamp to Virginia Dare for her 350th birthday. In the same year, a man named Louis Hammond claimed he found a 21-pound stone on the North Carolina-Virginia border. The stone had undecipherable carvings on it, so he brought it to Emory University\u0027s history department hoping someone there could read it. Three of the Emory scholars Haywood Pearce, Jr (center), James G Lester (left) and Ben W Gibson (right) are pictured with the Dare Stone          The Emory scholars were able to translate the messages on either side of the stone, which tells the gruesome and sad fate of the Roanoke colonists, if it is authentic. However, there were some doubts of the stone\u0027s authenticity among the higher ups at Emory, so Brenau University bought it. Brenau was run by Haywood Pearce Jr\u0027s father    Pearce Jr was unsuccessful in finding any other Dare Stones, so he opened up the search to the public, promising that Brenau would pay anyone who found any stones with carvings on them. Brenau\u0027s current president, Ed Schrader (right), who is also a geologist, is pictured discussing different stones at the University of North Carolina in Asheville for a History Channel program about the Dare Stones           The Pearces were somehow convinced of their legitimacy, Lawler writes, but Eberhardt\u0027s hoax was soon uncovered by the Saturday Evening Post in 1941, which left Brenau embarrassed. Pictured: Flour is applied to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text          \u0027Where do you put rocks?\u0027 Morrison says. \u0027We weren\u0027t crowing about them. We weren\u0027t showing them off or anything, but I don\u0027t think they were actually hiding them. I think they were just done with them. There was no champion for them around anymore and they just sort of languished around, no further advancement on them at all.\u0027 Schrader is pictured examining the original Dare Stone          In 2016, Brenau brought the Dare Stone to the geology department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where they have the equipment needed to cut a small part of the stone and do mineral and chemical analyses, which was also featured on a History Channel program in March 2017          The Dare Stone sits near a saw before a sample is taken during the filming of the 2017 History Channel program at the University of North Carolina Asheville          During the 2016 analysis, they found that the stone is almost completely pure white vein quartz with amounts of gold, selenium and copper, which helped narrow down the possible location of the stone to an area in southern Virginia, about 60 miles upriver from the approximate location of where the stone was found in 1937          Their next step, Morrison says, is to determine how thick the layer of patina, or film produced from oxidation, is around the stone, to pinpoint when the carving actually happened. They are also trying to put together a comprehensive team to thoroughly study the stone      ¿Dare Stone¿ Highlighted in Second Two-hour History Channel Program - Brenau University"},{"url":null,"title":"World Emoji Day 2018 need know","story":"New on Amazon Prime in August 2018: TV shows and movies coming soonIs a Fortnite TV show coming to Disney XD?Twitter reacts to Jason Momoa\u0027s new Aquaman poster with memesESPYs 2018: When is it, nominees, tickets and moreNelson Mandela International Day 2018: Everything you need to knowCelebrity Big Brother 2018: All you need to knowTake That tour: All you need to know about the 30th anniversary Greatest Hits tourGoogle and the United Nations Environment Programme to partner to monitor environmental changesWorld Emoji Day 2018: Everything you need to knowFortnite server crash sees players flood to PornhubEllen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Ellen DeGeneres\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after making the Forbes Celebrity 100 list Bachelorette spoilers: Will Becca Kufrin \u0027pull an Arie\u0027 and break up with the winner?Miss Universe Great Britain\u0027s Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers revealed after becoming first black woman to hold the title Donald Trump is the first result if you Google Image search \u0027idiot\u0027 Who will win Love Island 2018?

Instead, they pay rising annual fees to the freeholder, and often face onerous terms that can prevent them carrying out home improvements.Former Communities Secretary Sajid Javid described leasehold sales as ‘unjustified’ and last year announced a ban that will force developers to sell new homes as freehold.But despite the crackdown, there are no laws to help the hundreds of thousands of families who have already bought leasehold homes. Experts believe these properties will soon be seen as ‘damaged goods’ and may become hard to sell as their values fall.This week, Money Mail found two estates in Lancashire which were still being marketed as leasehold. Homes on the Douglas Meadow estate, outside Chorley, are on the market from Stewart Milne Homes for £267,950 for a detached four-bedroom or £399,950 for a five-bedroom, with shared landscaped park and play areas. Each house is leasehold and owners pay an annual ground rent of £250, which is reviewed in line with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation every ten years.Leasehold homes on the Jones Homes estate at Rivington Grange, in Horwich, Bolton, cost up to £199,950 for a three-bedroom, while a four-bedroom semi costs up to £252,950. Ground rents are understood to be about £200 a year for a £200,000 house, and are reviewed every 15 years in line with inflation.Have you bought a leasehold property?

Many of those hit were first-time buyers, some of whom used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to purchase homes with a 5 per cent deposit. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equity.Typically the leases they have last between 250 and 999 years. In some cases, their annual rent to the freeholder - who owns the land under the property - is scheduled to double every decade. That means a ground rent which starts at £250 a year rises to £500 a year after ten years, £1,000 after 20 years and £2,000 after 30.For property developers, this income stream can be lucrative. Many builders make extra profit by selling the freeholds - and all future ground rent income - to investment firms.          Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000In theory, homeowners retain the right to buy the freehold at a later date under the Leasehold Reform Act. But the prices set by freeholders can be tens of thousands of pounds. The contracts also state that leaseholders who want to make changes to their home - for instance, adding a conservatory - must often seek permission from the freeholder and pay a fee.Some who bought leasehold houses are already struggling to move home. Potential buyers fear the properties could become unsellable after the ban comes into force, and solicitors warn that banks have stopped lending on many leasehold properties where ground rents are due to double every decade.Some banks are refusing to offer loans if the ground rent is more than 0.1 per cent of the property’s value (i.e. £100 a year on a £100,000 flat). Karen and David Wilson had feared the leasehold scandal would leave them £92,000 out of pocket. In 2012, they bought a two-bed flat in Leeds from a private seller for their son Ben, now 35.          An estimated 200,000 families are stuck with blighted leasehold homes. If their property price falls, they face going into negative equityThe family tried to sell when Ben, a teacher, decided to move back to their home town of Ulverston in Cumbria. They found a buyer, but a day before completion the purchaser pulled out. Their solicitor had highlighted that the flat had a doubling ground rent clause in the lease.The family begged the freeholder to link the ground rent to RPI inflation instead, which should make it easier to sell. It initially refused, but relented after Money Mail intervened.Catherine Gale, 44, fears she faces a huge loss on her three-bedroom house outside Bolton. Catherine, who is orced, bought the property in 2007 for £200,000. Now she needs to move to provide more space for her three children, two of whom have autism. She struggles to afford the £500 ground rent, which is set to double every ten years.But homes on the estate have sold at tens of thousands of pounds less than their original price, she says. Catherine adds that although she knew the property was leasehold, she had little idea of what this meant. The developer, Taylor Wimpey, has since offered to allow Catherine and other owners on the estate the chance to link their ground rents to RPI inflation. It argues that this should make it cheaper for sellers to buy the freehold.But under Catherine’s current arrangement, ground rents can only increase five times under the RPI deal being offered, the number of increases will be unlimited. And if owners such as Catherine sign up for the change, they must waive their rights to take legal action against Taylor Wimpey over the doubling ground-rent clause. Catherine says: ‘I feel angry that we are all stuck.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We listened to the concerns and difficulties some customers were facing as a result of their doubling ground-rent lease terms and have taken action to put it right.‘We have reached agreements with our freeholders who own their leases to enable the majority of customers with a ten-year doubling lease to convert their ground rent to an RPI‑based structure.‘The use of RPI-linked leases is a nationally recognised and long-established measure, and is the most commonly used index for price increases across the leasehold residential sector.’Tory Sir Peter Bottomley, who has campaigned on leasehold issues, says: ‘The people responsible for this scandal - the Government, developers and freeholders - have to fund a solution that is equitable and effective for families stuck with toxic leases.’A Stewart Milne Homes spokesman says: ‘All our developments in the North-West have been freehold since January 1, 2018, with the exception of Douglas Meadow, which was not available for us to purchase on a freehold basis.‘We have waived all admin charges and fees and arranged for a long lease that tracks the Retail Price Index to ensure there are no unexpected increases for our home buyers.’A Jones Homes spokesman declined to comment. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/17/21/4E42089400000578-5964159-image-a-52_1531859678044.jpg","title":"All speak Meghan Markles father says wont stop talking media","story":"    Thomas Markle did another interview saying he won\u0027t stop speaking with the media until he\u0027s allowed to be a part of Meghan Markle\u0027s life           Thomas Markle said he\u0027s unfazed by reports that Meghan Markle and her new husband Prince Harry are \u0027frustrated\u0027 he keeps going to he media.

Between March and May, the number of full-time workers increased to a new high of 23.9 million.The 388,000 figure is the equivalent of 1,063 jobs being created every day.Part-time workers decreased on the previous three months by 40,000 to 8.5million, despite the popularity of ‘gig economy’ jobs working for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. There were only 1.41 million unemployed people who were actively looking for work between March and May, a fall of 84,000 on last year – driven by a rise in the number of women who had managed to find a job.Tara Sinclair, an economist for global jobs website Indeed, said: ‘The fuel on which the labour market runs – people wanting to get into work – is getting scarcer. So it’s both impressive and surprising that it is still managing to meet the demands of the economy’s job creation engine.’Britain’s unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent puts other European countries in the shade.

Although the jobs growth is encouraging, the slowing rises in pay could mean an interest rate hike will hamper consumer spending.A drop in stay-at-home carers led to a decline in the number of people not in work and not looking to work. Just 2 million people were choosing to stay unemployed to look after their family or home, the lowest since records began. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/02/4E4CF02A00000578-0-image-a-15_1531705516750.jpg","title":"Earliest memories begin age two","story":"    Almost 40 per cent of people claimed to have remembered things from before the age of twoParticipants in the study were told the memory should not be linked to photos of themselves, a family story, or any other source apart from direct experience.The authors said 60 per cent of first memories were from the average age of 3.24 years – matching research showing this is when we develop the mental faculties to form memories.But nearly 39 per cent of people – 2,487 – claimed to have memories from between the age of one and two.

Drivers were warned over particularly alcoholic desserts which could push them over the limitScot James Lawson, 35, of Edinburgh, said he had \u0027no idea\u0027 about orange juice or peppercorn sauce containing booze.He said: \u0027If I\u0027m driving I often just have a half-pint of lager and then switch to orange juice.\u0027I can easily have a few pints of orange juice if on a night out and never had any idea there was alcohol in it - I\u0027ll have to switch to fizzy water from now on.\u0027Ronnie Lawson-Jones, of All Car Leasing, said today (Tue) that drivers should beware of food and drink containing any alcohol at all - and be wary of how much they consume.He said: \u0027We wanted to highlight the potential unknown risks around driving whilst under the influence due to certain foods and drinks.\u0027You\u0027re unlikely to get through a bottle of hot sauce during one sitting, but two pints of orange juice? It\u0027s plausible.\u0027As a rule of thumb, two pints of regular-strength lager or two small glasses of wine would put you over the limit.\u0027Remember this doesn\u0027t apply for those living in Scotland, as it now has stricter alcohol limits for drivers, so be sure to double check the alcohol levels of your next indulgent meal.\u0027\u0027Whilst a light-hearted study, we felt people may want to know that some foods could add to their alcohol intake more than first thought.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/06/052D3CC0000003E8-5965247-image-a-2_1531893453216.jpg","title":"Number teenage mothers halves decade thanks Generation Sensible","story":"Modern teens ‘enjoy spending time with family over socialising with friends\u0027 (file photo) It said: ‘Many believe that sex is special and should only occur within the context of a trusting, committed relationship, and they have a negative perception of those they deem promiscuous.’Only just over a third of 16- to 18-year-olds that took part in the British Pregnancy Advisory Service research said they had lost their virginity. The report added: ‘Social, romantic and sexual relationships are increasingly experienced online, and sexting is seen as an alternative as well as a precursor to intercourse.’Yet the study gave no credit to the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, the campaign to promote contraception and sex education launched in 1998 by Tony Blair, for the huge fall in pregnancy among under-18s in England and Wales since 2007.           Teenagers are \u0027more interested in families, Facebook and careers than in sex\u0027 (file photo)It noted that the campaign, which led to a rise in teenage abortion, had been ditched in 2010 and added: ‘Teen conception rates have declined despite the closure of contraceptive services across the country, which may in turn be hampering young people’s ability to access contraceptive advice and support when needed. \u0027Therefore, while the uptake of long-acting methods of contraception will undoubtedly have had an impact, our research indicates that this alone cannot be responsible for the ongoing and significant decline in teenage pregnancy rates.’  Only a third of 16-18-year-olds that took survey said they had lost their virginity (file image) The findings by BPAS, which carried out 70,000 abortions in England and Wales last year, and which campaigns for abortion on demand, are among the first to try to explain the drop in teen pregnancy. In 1998, the year in which Mr Blair launched his campaign, there were 47.1 pregnancies for every 1,000 girls under 18 in England and Wales.By 2007, the level had declined only to 41.6, higher than in the early 1980s. However after 2007, the year in which social media took off, teen pregnancy rates started to fall fast, and in 2016 there were just 18.9 pregnancies among every 1,000 girls under 18.The BPAS report was based on focus groups of 16- to 18-year-olds, together with a poll of more than 1,000 young people of the same age, both run by YouGov.

Between March and May, the number of full-time workers increased to a new high of 23.9 million.The 388,000 figure is the equivalent of 1,063 jobs being created every day.Part-time workers decreased on the previous three months by 40,000 to 8.5million, despite the popularity of ‘gig economy’ jobs working for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. There were only 1.41 million unemployed people who were actively looking for work between March and May, a fall of 84,000 on last year – driven by a rise in the number of women who had managed to find a job.Tara Sinclair, an economist for global jobs website Indeed, said: ‘The fuel on which the labour market runs – people wanting to get into work – is getting scarcer. So it’s both impressive and surprising that it is still managing to meet the demands of the economy’s job creation engine.’Britain’s unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent puts other European countries in the shade.

Although the jobs growth is encouraging, the slowing rises in pay could mean an interest rate hike will hamper consumer spending.A drop in stay-at-home carers led to a decline in the number of people not in work and not looking to work. Just 2 million people were choosing to stay unemployed to look after their family or home, the lowest since records began. "},{"url":null,"title":"Netflix Amazon customers Sky BT","story":"    Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV now have 15.4 million UK subscriptions between themThe three most popular online streaming services – Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV – have 15.4 million UK subscriptions.Their popularity is taking money away from their pay TV rivals.

I am horrified NatWest could demand this money when they die.\u0027Barbara and Debbie are among dozens of readers who have written to Money Mail since we revealed that up to 1.5 million customers have been sold rip-off wills by banks.Families have begun trawling through the small print of their contracts and say they have discovered huge charges they knew nothing about. Some described how they successfully begged for a reduction in the fees.One man managed to get the fee cut from £14,000 to £6,000 after challenging his parents\u0027 bank.          Martha died aged 81 without children, so left her estate - worth just under £1m - to eight nieces and nephews. Above, Sheena pictured with her familyNatWest charges 2.5 per cent up to a maximum of £15,000 plus a £1,500 administration fee. A NatWest spokesman says: \u0027We offer upfront and transparent fees which are capped at a maximum amount. \u0027Where an estate is simple to administer we will look to offer a discount or, if appropriate, we will also offer the option for the bank to renounce. \u0027The bank is not automatically appointed as executor and customers are free to appoint a different executor at any time.\u0027A free will led to HSBC\u0027s plan to charge £14,000The first Graham Penfold knew about these fees was when a smartly-dressed woman knocked on his mum\u0027s door a few days after his dad, Dennis, died 11 years ago. Graham and his wife Janice were staying at his family home in London to help his mum Margaret, then 79, plan the funeral and sort out his father\u0027s affairs.The woman said she had been sent by HSBC to discuss Dennis\u0027s will. Graham says she explained that the bank had been named as an executor and planned to charge £14,000 to administer the estate.          In the end, Graham and his family paid a total of £6,563 including VAT and legal advice fees for the will, with the breakdown of costs shown aboveA Lloyds Bank spokesman says it reimbursed the family for some of the solicitor\u0027s fees they incurred because of the challenging of the will.He says: \u0027We\u0027re sorry for Ms Hayes\u0027s loss of her aunt and the challenges she has had dealing with the estate. \u0027Family disputes, particularly involving larger estates, can be complex and occasionally result in additional legal issues which are not covered by standard fees. \u0027In this case, caveats were raised by family members which we tried to resolve with minimal legal costs. However, we were forced to seek specialist legal advice to resolve the situation.\u0027          From Money Mail\u0027s story last monthAnother reader says her elderly friend\u0027s £310,000 estate was charged £16,000 by a bank to deal with matters after she died in 2008. This was on top of £4,406 paid to solicitors who handled the property sale.The reader also says she was told to contact the utility companies herself, along with sorting out other aspects of her friend\u0027s affairs.She adds that she had no idea about the fees until she received the documents back from the bank around a year later. She says: \u0027At the time I just assumed that it was the typical charge for administering a will. But now I look back, I think that the bank did very little to earn such a huge fee.\u0027How to fight back against high executor feesSo if you\u0027ve discovered that your bank intends to charge you thousands of pounds to act as executor, what can you do?First, write to your bank and ask if it will stand down. Banks typically charge a fee of around £250 to remove their name as executor. However, if you live in England and Wales, it could refuse. (In Scotland they must agree to give up this responsibility when asked.)You can also try to negotiate to bring down the fees. If all else fails, tear it up and start again. In your new will, just include a line to clarify that it revokes all previous versions.If you opt for a professional writing service, choose the firm carefully will-writing is an unregulated business and there are rogue firms out there.Check that the company is signed up to an industry trade body, such as the Society of Will Writers or the Institute of Professional Will Writers. These enforce strict rules to which members must adhere. Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors\u0027 Regulation Authority.You will likely be asked if you want to appoint the professional arranging your will as an executor. If your affairs are complicated, this could make sense. But check the fees. Beware if a firm tries to persuade you to appoint them as an executor. You may prefer to appoint a relative as an executor in the first place, particularly if your estate is relatively uncomplicated. If the executor needs legal help after you\u0027ve died, they can ask a probate broker such as Final Duties, which should provide a flat fee to deal with the estate.Even if your estate is more complex and you prefer a professional executor, then wherever possible try to include a relative as executor, too. They will understand your wishes better than a firm of solicitors.Most banks, including Zedra (which has taken over the Barclays probate business) and the Co-operative (which runs the former HSBC wills business), claim they will lower fees if an estate is very simple. NatWest says the same. So hold them to their word.Experts say as a rule of thumb that it should cost no more than £4,000 to administer a simple estate where no inheritance tax is due, savings are held in cash and there is a single property to be ided between your children.If an estate like this is being passed to your spouse, the fee should be even less. Higher charges may be justified if inheritance tax is due on the estate or if it includes stock market shares, which can take time to sell.If you or a loved one has already paid charges to the bank from the estate, you\u0027re unlikely to get your money back even if you believe the terms were unfair. However, it is still worth complaining to the bank. Lay out the fees and explain why you believe your loved one\u0027s estate was overcharged.If you do not get a satisfactory response, take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can make a complaint six years from the event or three years from the time that you knew (or could have reasonably known) you had cause to complain.Even if your loved one died long ago, it may be possible to argue that you realised that the fees were excessive only after reading about the issue in Money Mail this year. £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroad"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/09/4E5D824C00000578-5965617-image-a-1_1531902983280.jpg","title":"Great Western Railway guard reduces comedian tears forcing mobility scooter","story":"    Tanyalee Davis, 47, as visibly upset in a film recorded by her partner A comedian was left sobbing on a train after a guard ordered her to move her mobility scooter out of the wheelchair area - before making a public announcement about her.Addressing all passengers on the train heading for Norwich from Plymouth, on Sunday, the Great Western Railway (GWR) employee said the train would be stopping because of 47-year-old Tanyalee Davis.The comedian, 47, was ordered to move so a woman\u0027s pram could go in the disabled space.Ms Davis explained the woman had a newborn but had hurt her arm so could not hold her baby.When she refused, because she could not do so, she claims she was \u0027harassed\u0027 and \u0027shamed\u0027. She said the guard announced over the tannoy: \u0027We\u0027re going to be stopping in Taunton indefinitely because the woman in the mobility scooter is causing problems.\u0027They are videotaping me and threatening to put it on the internet.\u0027    Tanyalee Davis, 47, was forced to move her mobility scooter on a train.

It was less intimidating than the grand “castle keep” way in on Cromwell Road.“All the data we have shows that it is much more attractive to non-traditional museumgoers,” said Hunt. “It is less, frankly, scary.”The figures were also boosted by the success of its Pink Floyd show, which overtook David Bowie to become the museum’s most popular music exhibition.Hunt said there was a buzz around the museum but visitor numbers were not everything. “It is wonderful to get to 4 million visitors, but my ambition is not to get to 5 million visitors. My ambition is to make sure we are doing more with education and design and to make sure our scholarship and research is where it needs to be.”The V\u0026ampA opened its new £55m porcelain-tiled piazza and entrance, together with underground exhibition space, last June. Designed by Amanda Levete Architects, it was the successor to the polarising 1997 design by Daniel Libeskind, once described as “the Guggenheim in Bilbao turned on its side and then beaten senseless with a hammer”. Plans for the Spiral were eventually pulled in 2004.The busyness and buzziness of the V\u0026ampA is a long way from the turn of the millennium when visitor numbers fell to 1.22 million and the public struggled to understand what the museum was for.Among the plans for 2019 will be exhibitions dedicated to food, opening in May, and cars, opening in October.Hunt said the V\u0026ampA had been unashamedly populist since it opened in 1852. “Whether it is our Fabergé exhibitions of the past, or Britain Can Make It in 1946, we’ve had this long history of attractive, popular exhibitions and I hope these will be in the same lineage as that whilst not giving an inch in the scholarship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c740474308c44dcb43b86ec599ba5ef3fbb3125/0_107_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f771d3ca159ce8cecfc153a8b120086","title":"from catullus to dylan thomas the top 10 elegies","story":"They date back to ancient times and remain a strong current in modern poetry. Here are some of the best Elegy, an inidual response to the death of a person or a group, began in Greece and Rome as a particular metrical form. But elegies are among the greatest poems in every language, whatever their form. Traditionally, they mirror three elements of mourning: grief memories of the dead and some kind of consolation – because people in grief often find relief in poems expressing a loss they thought was unique to them. But elegy took me completely by surprise, just as death itself can do. When I began work on my new collection Emerald, I was simply interested in the gems themselves, their mining, myths, geology, history. I talked to emerald cutters, pondered the paradoxical symbolism of green, colour of envy and poison as well as magic. Then, very suddenly, my 97-year old mum was rushed to hospital. During that dark time, the emeralds surprised me by triggering a flood of poems about her: her jokes and determination, the pleasure she took in talking to old friends, the generous mutual support of everyone in the family as she died my childhood memories of her snapshots of her childhood.  After she died, I realised that because she was a biologist, and passionate naturalist, these jewels signifying spring, hope and renewal were also offering, totally unexpectedly, true elegiac consolation in the saving green of nature. Elegies are a rich seam in poetry, so I have ided my choices into 10 distinct sub-genres.1. Elegy for a child: A Part Song by Denise Riley  (from Say Something Back)The worst loss of all. Riley’s heart-rending poem on the death of her adult son follows a powerful tradition of lament for children that includes the 14th-century poem Pearl, in which a father loses his “pearl” in a garden, and Ben Jonson’s poem On My First Son. Riley’s poem begins by questioning the point of poetry and “song”, but goes on, through vivid domestic memories evoking the infant, the boy and the man, to demonstrate how very powerful elegy can be, and how loss is at the heart of all lyric poetry.2. Elegy for a mother: Freud’s Beautiful Things by Emily Berry (from Stranger Baby)Nearly everyone loses a mother. But relationships with mothers vary and everyone’s loss is different. Seamus Heaney’s sequence for his mother, Clearances, is gentle and measured Berry opens her breathtaking book on her mum’s death (when she herself was seven) with Freud’s comment that “the loss of a mother must be something very strange”. Freud’s Beautiful Things is an exquisitely controlled journey through loss, chaos, hurt and anger, but also love and hope.3. Elegy for a father: Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by Dylan Thomas Thomas’s poem for his dying father is a villanelle, a form in which two lines repeat (just as thoughts recur obsessively in grief) and appear together in the hard-hitting ending: “Do not go gentle into that good night.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Sylvia Plath’s poem Daddy is a more savagely conflicted variation, driven not only by loss but by the fury at abandonment that also needs to be acknowledged in mourning. “I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.”4. Elegy for a wife: Orpheus and Eurydice by Czeslaw Milosz, translated by the author and Robert Hass (from Selected and Last Poems, 1931-2004) In this marvellous poem, Lithuanian poet Milosz entering the hospital to visit his dying wife becomes Orpheus braving the underworld, failing to recover Eurydice. Another more recent, devastating elegy for a wife is Ian Patterson’s The Plenty of Nothing, for Jenny Diski. Further back in this tradition are Milton’s sonnet, Methought I saw my late espoused saint, and Thomas Hardy’s The Voice, the latter written at a moment when the death of his wife, with whom relations had broken down, turned a great novelist into an even greater poet.5. Elegy for a husband: Elegy for my husband by Toi DerricotteThis harrowing poem foregrounds injustice in her husband’s early life: “the aunt bleeding out on the highway  (too black for the white ambulance to pick up).” It memorialises his body: both her own memories of it (“the hand that laid itself over my heart and saved me  the eyes that held the long gold tunnel I believed in”) and its private past: “muscles which white girls longed to touch  but must not … You would be lynched in that all-white town you grew up in.” The poem ends with bare, inescapable loss: “All that is gone.” The only consolation here is in the artistry, the true placing of beautiful, powerful words.6. Elegy for a brother: Poem 101 by Catullus, translated by Anne Carson(from Nox by Anne Carson)This famous Latin poem was written in original “elegiac couplets” by the Roman poet Catullus for his brother, who died far away from Rome. Tragically aware it is addressing “silent ash”, the poem ends ave atque vale, “hail and farewell”. Carson memorialised her own dead brother by translating this as the centrepiece in a memory-box of scraps for her brother: a box that Carson (echoing Catullus’s Poem Five which says, “once our brief light is set, we must sleep a perpetual night”) labelled Nox – “Night”. An echo-box that doubles as a tomb.7. Elegy for an idealised girl: She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways by William WordsworthA lost loved girl is a potent muse. Wordsworth’s “Lucy” poems evoke unrequited love. Scholars argue whether she really existed, this Lucy who lived and died unnoticed by everyone but Wordsworth, who never told. His haunting poem projects onto Lucy his own sense of loneliness and loss, just as it was the death of a friend’s daughter that inspired Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke to write his mysterious elegiac sequence Sonnets to Orpheus, in which the archetypal poet searches for the dead girl he will always fail to bring back to the light.8. Elegy for a fellow poet: In Memory of WB Yeats by WH AudenA poet’s sense of vocation can be tipped into crisis by the death of another poet whose work they passionately admire. Thomas Gray’s Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard was probably inspired by the death of poet Richard West Shelley’s 55-stanza poem Adonais is an elegy for Keats. And Auden’s elegy for Yeats is a touchstone for all poets, reminding us that poetry, the generative lens through which poets see the world, “makes nothing happen”. But also that poetry “survives  in the valley of its making”.9. Elegy for a friend: In Memoriam by Alfred, Lord TennysonPoets are often close friends, so categories eight and nine overlap. One recent elegy I find especially poignant is Don Paterson’s poem Two Trees for his dear friend, poet Michael Donaghy. The great English prototype of elegy for a friend is Milton’s poem Lycidas: published, like Shelley’s Adonais, the same year the friend drowned. Tennyson, though, took 16 years to finish his 133 cantos. In Memoriam is a goldmine of deep-felt grief, summing up the centrality of loss to human life: “Better to have loved and lost  Than never to have loved at all.”10. Elegy for a group: Requiem by Anna Akhmatova translated by Judith Hemschemeyer (from Complete Poems of Anna Akhmatova)Elegies for a group are among the most profound poems of all. Death Fugue by German poet Paul Celan is one of his most famous poems but all his work memorialises victims of the Holocaust as Michael Longley’s Wounds elegises victims of the Northern Irish Troubles and Thom Gunn’s collection The Man with Night Sweats addreses Aids-related in the 1980s. Akhmatova’s Requiem memorialises the suffering of the Soviet Union under Stalin’s purges. Refusing to go into exile, she dangerously carried it with her, writing and redrafting it for three decades, in towns across the Soviet Union. “The ones who smiled  Were the dead, glad to be at rest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f390dac2ad03730ea2978742e526b01dfb293b/0_79_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2ff7d0ed1a3bab3b44d6e704877873f","title":"uk interest rate rise in doubt as inflation stays at 24","story":"Slowing house price rises and summer clothing sales dampen predicted leapThe chances of a rise in interest rates in August have dipped after British inflation remained at a one-year low last month.

A team of scientists will be watching these human guinea pigs in a simulated real-life environment with sensors, microphones and wearable technology to monitor their physical, mental and emotional responses to the environment or building design.When complete, the 25,000 sq ft Well Living Lab, the first scientific research centre in Asia to focus on the indoor environment, will feature a range of simulated homes and offices. The facility will make small variations to the environment – in lighting, air quality and noise levels, for example – and monitor how they affect workers’ health, happiness and productivity. The research findings will be used to change the way future buildings are designed.“More and more architects, interior designers and engineers are working together with scientists for healthy design, and thinking about how to make the space more like human beings’ natural life,” says Xue Ya, Asia president at Delos Living, part of the team behind the Well Living Lab.Planned experiments include controlling the light in offices using a series of different types of windows and imported “smart glass” panels around the building, to analyse which has the most impact on productivity. A rotating research centre can turn 360 degrees, with adjustable interior lamps changing the colour, temperature, brightness and light spectrum. Large buildups under the floor and ceilings will hide hundreds of biometric and environmental sensors to monitor and record experiments. Entrants to the building will need to pass through three layers of doors into a protected environment with triple glazing.Architect Ruben Bergambagt of Superimpose says the design needs “ultimate flexibility” to anticipate future experiments. “Sometimes the research will be residential-focused, or for offices, or participants will spend a few weeks living and working on site and being part of the research – they need to change the building configuration constantly,” he says. There is an existing Well Living Lab in Rochester, Minnesota, a collaboration between Delos and the Mayo Clinic that is only a quarter of the size of the Beijing site. Researchers there have used cognitive tests, wearable and environmental sensors, observation and ethnography in initial research, and an ongoing three-year project is looking at responses to artificial lighting that simulates natural light and its impact on stress, sleep, job satisfaction and productivity.  An initial research study, published last January, involved 18 workers monitored in a simulated open-plan office in the existing Well Living Lab. Over several weeks, lighting, temperature and sound levels were varied, and their impacts on health monitored. Experiments included making the office uncomfortably cold, adding high levels of noise, and taking away or adding daylight. The researchers quickly concluded that occupants strongly preferred daylight to electric light – but if electric lights were used, then certain types of blue-enriched lamps were found to improve workers’ sleep patterns, mood and alertness. Chinese developer Sino-Ocean, which is building the lab in Beijing as part of a wellness-themed industrial park, will use the findings to adjust the way they run and construct their buildings in China. All their new office buildings will be built to the International Well Building Institute’s (IWBI) Well standard, which sets performance requirements related to air, water, nourishment, light, fitness and comfort. An example of Well research informing design is the finding that workers are less productive if stationed more than 7.5 metres away from a window.Beijing is still regularly heavily polluted. In March this year sandstorms helped PM2.5 air pollution reach 238μgm3 WHO guidelines say anything above 25μgm3 is dangerous to human health. But despite its less-than-green reputation, China is already the biggest investor by far in green technology, investing more than double the amount the US does and five times more than Britain. A report from the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis in January concluded that China accounts for half of the world’s $2.2tn investment in energy efficiency, and is by far the largest force in global clean energy development.As part of its 13th five-year plan, Beijing has mandated at least half of new urban buildings must be green-certified by 2020. According to the IWBI, 220 of the world’s 871 Well-certified projects are in China. The country also ranks number one outside the US for projects certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) green building rating, home to 1,240 out of 6,657 Leed-certified projects globally.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b37ffe0ab22254953732b6e199271f25600c014/0_86_6587_3952/master/6587.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7adc774188c3fb57fbe69eb217082e7d","title":"national unity government second referendum no deal brexit","story":"Two is a coincidence, but three’s a trend – and now three Tory MPs in the space of 24 hours have uttered the phrase “national unity government”. It sounds fantastical, in a country that has had no such thing for three-quarters of a century, but could it happen – and should it?It’s no mystery why Anna Soubry, Nicholas Soames and, less directly, Dominic Grieve are suggesting an all-party national administration might be necessary. Tuesday’s Brexit votes in the Commons showed that the current Conservative government is hopelessly paralysed. It cannot drive through its own agenda, insofar as it has one at all. Indeed, it ended up whipping MPs to vote for Brexiteer amendments that undermined, if not sabotaged, the Chequers agreement that was meant to be the government’s settled position. In other words, Theresa May feared the Brexiteer rebels so much, she decided that, since she couldn’t beat them, she would compel her MPs to join them.And that’s even before the tattered and torn Chequers agreement makes contact with Brussels reality and the European Union’s negotiators, who are likely to dismiss it as unworkable. It is possible to conceive of a plan that Britain could propose and that the EU 27 might accept – but we now know that May simply would not have the votes in parliament to get such a plan through. Which is why it’s no surprise to hear that the Netherlands has hired 1,000 extra customs officers for trade with Britain: like many of our continental neighbours, they are sensibly preparing for a no-deal Brexit.A national unity government could avert that catastrophe. It could draw on the inbuilt Commons majority that exists for averting no deal, combining, as Soubry told BBC Radio 4’s Today, pragmatic MPs from the Tory, Labour, SNP and Plaid Cymru benches – all of whom would agree on one thing, if nothing else: that crashing out of the EU would be a calamity for the country’s economy and security.It would be an extreme measure, but these are extreme times: the gravest crisis since the second world war, according to Soames. And in some ways the taboo that ordinarily stands in the way of a national unity government – party loyalty – is breaking down anyway. Witness the five Labour MPs (including one who sits as an independent) who defied their party – and thereby saved May from defeat – by voting against the measure that would have kept Britain in a customs union as a backstop arrangement.And yet, for all that logic, a formal national government remains unlikely. The very phrase still strikes terror into Labour politicians, among whom the betrayal of Ramsay MacDonald – who broke from his party to lead a national administration in 1931 – has never been forgotten or forgiven. Tories who agreed to sit on the same benches as Labour MPs, perhaps – who knows? – under a Labour prime minister, would similarly be cast out as traitors for evermore. As Nick Clegg and his fellow Liberal Democrats can testify, coalition can be career-ending – if not at the hands of your own party activists, then at the hands of the electorate.So a formal national government, with an all-party cabinet and the like, is not on the cards. That does not, however, rule out a looser scenario. Grieve sketched it out on the BBC’s Newsnight on Tuesday, when he said that, should it be confronted by no deal, “parliament will assert its own authority”. He predicted that MPs would throw off the constraints of party allegiance and: “If it comes to the crunch, there would be a substantial majority to prevent no deal.”One can imagine such a vote in the Commons, instructing May to do whatever it took to avert a crash exit. But then what? May could attempt to turn that Commons majority into a government of national unity – but that’s unlikely, for all the reasons set out above. She could take it as the cue for a general election, though she would fear that amounted to handing the Downing Street keys to Jeremy Corbyn. Or she could say that, with parliament stalemated on all but its opposition to no deal, the only solution is to throw the decision back to the people in a referendum.That, for her and plenty of others, would surely be the least worst option. Which is why the likelihood of a “people’s vote” is growing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4e8ceeb92db028b688b17dade412956a713d78/0_21_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0eaf37ffd28d27529c05f4d380572a88","title":"what does childbirth feel like google","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Our writers answer some of the commonest queriesTwenty-four hours into my labour I could be found wearing a pair of XXL hi-vis trousers – the kind worn by overweight construction workers as they repave motorways – walking up and down a small, rat-scuttled stretch of the River Lea, rubbing my nipples like kindling and muttering to my partner in the steady, driving rain.Six hours into my labour I was eating a chicken bagel on a bouncing birthing ball, watching Dr No with my cousin 48 hours into my labour, I woke up, light-headed and wet, my waters broken 51 hours into my labour, I was kneeling in a birthing pool in Homerton hospital, holding a beautiful, howling prune in my arms.Like cheese sandwiches, the Milibands and snowflakes, no two labours are ever the same. The same mother with the same father in the same room will have utterly different experiences with each child, let alone the differences from woman to woman. You may have a caesarian, you may have an epidural, you may deliver in the bathroom, you may be sent home from the hospital you may tear, you may take no pain relief, you may be induced, you may deliver early, you may need interventions you may mistake the early signs, you may not.But remember this: any labour that results in a healthy mother and a healthy baby is a good labour. Any woman who goes through any form of childbirth is a hero. The blood, the courage, the self-sacrifice, the stamina, the body-shuddering pressure, the fear, the gore: no wonder men had to invent war to soothe their phenomenal sense of inadequacy. Childbirth is an act of bravery, strength and endurance no man will ever know.When I was pregnant, people seemed eager to tell me horror stories about the women they’d known who had suffered greatly. Those experiences are real and valid and belong to the women who experienced them. But if you are pregnant, or thinking of getting pregnant while reading this, may I simply say: it isn’t always like that. It can be very different.Let us begin with contractions, for that is probably how things will start. My friend, the author Amy Liptrot, described contractions as “an earthquake going through your body”. It is, for me, a perfect description. I was expecting nuclear period pains – what I got, as my mother did before me, was a feeling like an HGV reversing into my lower back. They were seriously heavy weather and I remember thinking, two days in, as I hung on to the windowsill, in the dark, my partner rubbing my back, my face against the glass, “I am never doing this ever again.”They were unrelenting – a near-total block on thought, a thick black noise filling every inch of my body, an unshareable weight, a central focus for all the gravity in the universe. But they weren’t exactly painful – just overwhelming and exhausting. Because they kept on coming.Of course, people do experience incredible pain and if you are induced, your contractions will feel entirely different. I mention mine simply to point out that contractions, like all elements of labour, may not be what you’re expecting. If you possibly can, do not resist them, for they are productive, necessary and they do pass. I found this balloon metaphor quite helpful.My waters finally broke after two days and two nights of contractions. I felt suddenly light, radiant, made of something like glass – everything was bright and sharp but also shining. As I walked through the hospital I felt each breath rushing in like something white and icy.I had been sent home twice that previous night, hunkered over like an animal, a towel over my head to block out the world, heaving, groaning, sweating, impatient, throbbing. I had endured contractions lying on a bed, under a screaming fluorescent bulb, two monitor belts across my belly. I was not ready yet. I had to go home. I have never been so disappointed.When I returned that morning, light-headed, my pyjamas wet, unable to sit, walking like sand, the midwife examined me to discover that I was fully dilated. I have never felt such relief.“Nell, can you feel anything in your bottom?” the beautiful, clear-faced midwife asked me as I lay naked on a mattress beside the window. Did she mean the contractions? This pulsating heaving pressure in my lower back? “Do you mean my pooing bum?” I asked, bleary-eyed. She did. I felt nothing until, dragging my way into the toilet for a wee, I suddenly felt the urge. I walked out of the toilet, into my birthing room, naked, sweat-soaked, eyes half closed. “My bum,” I announced, “is now involved.”Pushing out a baby, the final stage, was – and please believe me when I say this – wonderful. After two days of contractions – a feeling that I was getting nowhere, the almost unbearable wait punctuated by the unrelenting crashing waves of pressure – to realise that I was finally going to evacuate was brilliant. Suddenly, I didn’t care where I was, who was with me, what happened. I could have pushed that baby out in the middle of a Lidl car park.As I knelt in the pool, gripping my partner by the fists, following the breathing directed by the midwife, I knew somehow what it took. This pushing was familiar, innate. Not unlike a shit, of course, but somehow phenomenal in its scale. I could actually feel the limbs, the corners, the structure of my baby moving down through my body.My limbs were merely ribbons hanging off this giant, pulsating tube. I was a volcano, a child, a rigid blank in the centre of a moving world. I felt a pop in my vulva. I felt with grim acceptance that I had torn my vagina into a doily I had been too eager and ripped it apart. “That was just the seal around the baby’s head,” my angel midwife said, from somewhere behind my arse.I pushed. I felt a head and then it slipped away. I asked my partner if the baby was out. He managed, somehow, to keep a straight face. It was not. Then, finally, out it came, in two enormous heaves that turned my face puce: a Francis Bacon painting of hot purple contortion so furious I had to dip it in the water around my body for relief.Childbirth feels like everything to everyone. Wolves gnawing at your entrails, blue medical hairnets, a thundering ocean, white noise, sandwiches in plastic packets, teeth-chattering nerves, the ripping apart of your pelvis like tectonic plates, the click and drip of machinery, lightning down your spine, the pale blank hum of a hospital light, the onion sweat of animals, panic, darkness, exhaustion, a mist that becomes hail, leaving your body, believing in your body, a beleaguered body, a body pulled from your body.There is no good labour and no bad labour. Anyone who births a child, by whatever means, deserves our admiration and our support. They should feel proud that’s what childbirth should feel like.

The assurances, which became legally binding when they were incorporated into the High Speed Rail Act, stated HS2 Ltd would have a dialogue with the Cycle Proofing Working Group (CPWG), a government advisory body, with the assumption that they would include high quality design standards.Members of the CPWG say HS2 Ltd breached that agreement when it adapted poor cycling design standards without consulting them, adding that HS2 Ltd claimed there was not enough money in the £56bn project to cycle proof phase 1.They say, while adding extra width on 40 bridges and tunnels at construction phase would cost very little, the high cost of retrofitting tunnels and bridges means cycling could be permanently designed out.In a select committee meeting on Tuesday, CPWG members said the same thing looks set to happen again with phase 2a, from West Midlands to Crewe, following a letter sent by HS2 director Oliver Bayne on Monday referring to following the “principles” of design standards, rather than the “applicable aspects” of them. These pledges do not become legally binding until the HS2 phase 2a Act is passed. Before the meeting, Phil Jones of transport consultants PJA and a CPWG member, said: “HS2 have treated the CPWG with contempt. They were supposed to engage with us, but the only engagement was turning up to two meetings, and making some vague statements with no further commitment to do anything. Highways England and the Welsh government have both adopted high quality design standards, which set out minimum standards for cycling, and Jones joined Cycling UK in calling for HS2 to do the same.John Grimshaw, co-founder of sustainable transport charity Sustrans, wrote a feasibility report on an HS2 cycleway which was proposed by government but later cancelled – Grimshaw says the report was presented to local authorities, effectively leaving it to them to deliver. He says cycling provision on the 40 crossings would, in many cases, cost a minimal amount but benefit communities.“If you don’t plan for cycling provision on bridges or tunnels you design out cycling forever,” he said. “It will make it prohibitively expensive in the future to do them.”Grimshaw told the committee it was “extremely difficult to get HS2 to make minor changes that would cost pennies” and pleaded with HS2 to “link local communities, rather than separate them”.For example, he says children living in Quainton in Aylesbury, who go to school in Waddesdon two miles away, will not be able to ride to school after phase 1 of HS2 is built. Grimshaw told the : “In the original proposal there was an underpass that mysteriously got dropped, and now if you want to cycle between the two you face a 60mph road.”The HS2 route through Birmingham has six major bridges planned, none of which, the  understands, will have cycling provision. Campaigners are concerned HS2 has not made clear how communities can apply for such provision.In Tuesday’s meeting, Peter Miller, director of environment for HS2, described the difficulties of including a cycle lane on one road HS2 is already widening near Yarnfield, in Staffordshire, and said it was difficult to cost cycling infrastructure. He questioned whether there was any desire for cycle crossings from communities along the route.The former HS2 and cycling minister, Robert Goodwill, was among those who supported a network of bridleways alongside HS2 in 2015.Tim Mould QC, representing HS2, said that though it was up to HS2 to build crossings, it was up to Cycling UK to negotiate the necessary permissions for cycling, for which the secretary of state set aside £15,000 for the entire HS2 phase 2a route. Geffen said: “HS2 Ltd could be a model of best practice for cycle proofing. However, employing sub-standard cycle provision and penny-pinching on the costs of tunnels and bridges means they’re on the opposite course.”An HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: “To help ensure HS2 leaves a positive road safety legacy for local communities, £36.5m has been made available through the Road Safety Fund for Phase 1 and 2a, ensuring areas along the route benefit from high quality road and cycle safety projects. HS2 is engaging with various organisations to identify opportunities where cycling can be incorporated in the design.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0956fa5bc28b5b01ca75bf3c1dab5179936d299/395_231_2756_1653/master/2756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646f9beb62cae21743bd1e71c878f4e1","title":"swan upping on the thames counting the queens birds in pictures","story":"This week marks the annual stocktake of the crown’s swans on the River Thames, known as swan upping.

Could he have somehow foreseen the eerily specific prescience of Batman’s introduction in 2008’s The Dark Knight, modern superhero cinema’s unwitting blueprint? Christian Bale’s caped crusader doesn’t show his cowled face until a few scenes into the film, after the Joker has pulled off his daring bank heist. Bruce Wayne arrives on the scene to bust up a powwow between some mobsters and guest villain Scarecrow, but he’s preceded by some paunchy copycats armed with shotguns and hockey pads. Their effort to emulate Batman only gets them into trouble, until the genuine article shows up to dispatch the goons with minimal difficulty. Purrs the Scarecrow: “That’s more like it.”The dour, oppressively grey DC Cinematic Universe is likewise littered with cinematic imitators of Nolan’s vision, having learned all the wrong lessons from Batman’s example. Led by chief architect Zack Snyder, the DC Comics adaptations fell in line behind the gargantuan box office success of Nolan’s films by aping his tone in the hopes that that would be sufficient to recreate the magic. And while box office grosses have for the most part remained healthy, the quality of the films themselves has never come close to matching the rigorous precision, popcorn philosophizing, and sheer cinematic verve of the film now celebrating its tenth anniversary. “We’re going to do this forever, aren’t we?” taunts the Joker, near the tail end of The Dark Knight. Little did he know their psychotic pas de deux would be rehashed over and over again.Bolstered by an ambitious script from Nolan, his brother (and, elsewhere, Westworld co-creator) Jonathan, and regular DC Comics scribe David Goyer, The Dark Knight ushered in an age of po-faced seriousness – a look that takes a lot of gravitas to pull off. Breaking from a more sprightly, brightly-colored tradition of comic book films best exemplified by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man pictures, Nolan nudged the genre in the direction of hard realism. Bale’s Batman doesn’t behave like a valiant defender of the defenseless, rather like a hard-nosed cop unencumbered by legal codes of conduct. The Joker, a role that enshrined Heath Ledger in myth following his untimely passing, is no mere super villain, either. He’s an ideological deviant, referred to at least once in the script directly as a “terrorist”, compelled only by the love of violence and chaos. His agenda is chilling in its indifference he gleefully sets a mountain of money ablaze in full view of the crooks he took it from, just to show them that this is a war fought on principle. He’s the closest thing to nuance that the DC rogues’ gallery has ever seen, and characteristic of a film founded in social theory. The Joker’s grand evil scheme? Sociology thought experiments … made real!With Wonder Woman as the emboldened, upbeat exception along with the wisecracking Flash (Ezra Miller, livening up Justice League every time he appeared onscreen), the recent efforts from the DC camp simply slather on the somberness. They mistake world-weariness for outright pessimism, and aspire to nothing more profound than that most overused of registers: “gritty”. The DC canon has more grit than a sandpaper factory, full of grimacing heroes who would fly into the sun before they allowed themselves to crack a smile. They consider wielding power to be a great and terrible burden, just like Batman, but unlike the brutal vigilante protecting a town that nonetheless loathes him, they’re not supported with the motivation for that jaded viewpoint.More troubling still, DC’s works form the vanguard of a much wider movement towards the homogeneously dark. To varying levels of success, there’s been a mass gritification through Hollywood, affecting everyone from Robin Hood to Universal’s cabal of monster-movie spooks. The Dark Knight’s excellence has been all but boiled down to the single, caveman-simplistic notion that bummer equals mature. Constant flops along the lines of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword have proven otherwise, but this is apparently a lesson that must be learned many times over.While it’s no fair to hold its unruly offspring against The Dark Knight, it’s all the same frustrating that the rich backlog of comic book arcana from the DC catalogue has never been mined with the same thoughtfulness and technical ingenuity. To paraphrase the film’s pensive final monologue: we’ve been given the releases that DC’s bottom line needs, but not the ones that Batman’s memory deserves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/752fea37e79d3bfc305e58e2a0d5787c07613a59/0_0_1653_2303/master/1653.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=080ef409b6ac74a7a6ef71cf70c65ed8 720w","title":"the world cup colour chart a photographic journey","story":"Looking back at the highs and lows of Russia 2018 via a rainbow of imagery, from Gareth Southgate to France lifting the trophy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/820334dc36538ff0331faf92afc8cdc5a7a720c8/0_190_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c8fc65d18ba57d97bb7905a40cb40d9","title":"the 30 best photos of the 2018 world cup in pictures","story":"Our picture editor, Jonny Weeks, chooses his favourite images from Russia, including some of the more unusual shots that may not have made the papers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9959ea87c1db2830e9fc6990f5fd9106f48c977/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d94fb29262ee21a3cb7438351560d590","title":"world cup transfer window ten players value","story":"Harry Maguire, Yerry Mina, Ivan Perisic and Eden Hazard will command much higher fees now than a month agoBy Martin Laurence for WhoScoredWell that was fun, wasn’t it? The 2018 World Cup delivered entertainment until the very last. As ever, a number of players did their reputations no harm. With attentions now inevitably switching to the transfer window, here are 10 players who have seen their value increase significantly thanks to their impressive performances in Russia this summer.Eden Hazard has made no secret of his interest in a potential move to Real Madrid following Belgium’s exit from the World Cup. Chelsea fans can at least take solace from the fact his value will have risen even further this summer. The Belgium captain led by example in Russia with three goals, two assists and more dribbles than any other player (40). He was the most consistent attacking player at the World Cup – and our player of the tournament.Belgium’s progress at the World Cup came to an end when Thomas Meunier was not in the side, which is no coincidence. He was extremely important to Roberto Martínez’s side at both ends of the pitch and he was missed in the semi-final defeat to France. World class full-backs are at something of a premium and the 26-year-old was one of the best in Russia, scoring one goal and providing two assists. He went into the tournament after a frustrating season at PSG but his performances may have convinced new manager Thomas Tuchel that he should take over from Dani Alves as first choice. If Meunier does leave Paris, he will be of interest to various clubs across the continent.A lack of first-team opportunities in La Liga last season meant Denis Cheryshev was not a starter when the hosts kicked off the first game of the tournament against Saudi Arabia. An injury to Alan Dzagoev gave the winger the chance to impress and, boy, did he take it. With four goals in 304 minutes of action – including some superb strikes – the 27-year-old may be angling for a move this summer. Villarreal would be wise to profit on a player who started just nine of his 24 league appearances last season.Just how much is Harry Maguire’s sizeable head worth? Considerably more than it was before the World Cup. The centre-back was one of England’s best attacking weapons this summer and, beyond his threat from set pieces, the 25-year-old showed great composure and endeavour to bring the ball out from the back. He only moved clubs a year ago, so any offers for Maguire would probably have to be a lot more than the £17m Leicester paid Hull City last June.Yerry Mina, a defender who had just as big an impact from set pieces as Maguire, is likely to put a disappointing six-month spell at Barcelona behind him. The Colombia international only arrived at Camp Nou in January but he is already being linked with an exit, with Clement Lenglet’s arrival from Sevilla pushing him closer to the door. Barcelona will have been pleased to see the centre-back score in all three of his appearances at the World Cup and they will now hope to make a significant profit on a player who started just four league games last season.A four-time Champions League winner and now world champion to boot, Raphaël Varane has very little still to win in the game at the age of just 25. It’s surprising, then, that his tally of 27 league starts last season was the highest of his career. While injuries and competition have been the cause of that inconsistency, Varane has been mooted with a move for a number of years. His performances at the World Cup may have made him the most expensive centre-back in the game.Two years ago Benjamin Pavard had just signed for Bundesliga II club Stuttgart and was watching Euro 2016 in a fanzone with his friends. He was drafted into the France starting line-up at the end of last season due to an injury to Djibril Sidibé and was forced to play out of his favoured centre-back position on the right of the back four. The 22-year-old ended up playing a pivotal role in their world title. He scored a goal-of-the-tournament contender in a memorable match against Argentina and attracted widespread interest for his overall performances. Bayern Munich had hoped to secure Pavard’s services next summer by activating a release clause that is yet to come into effect, but Stuttgart may want to cash in now and make a substantial amount more than the £30m they would receive next year.Having failed to make the right-back place his own at Atlético Madrid, Sime Vrsaljko will have no shortage of suitors should the club wish to make a quick buck on the Croatia defender this summer. He had huge shoes to fill on the international stage but he channeled his inner Dario Srna during the World Cup and offered a real outlet down the right flank for the runners up. His stamina and workrate were outstanding, especially against England.Having only arrived at Besiktas on a free transfer in January, Domagoj Vida is likely to make the Super Lig club a pretty penny this summer. The 29-year-old struggled to hold down a starting place last season so the Black Eagles will surely look to exploit the spike in his value, even though they have already said goodbye to Serbia international Dusko Tosic already this summer. Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing Dejan Lovren’s international defensive partner for a reported £20m, with Besiktas tipped to hold out for even more than that.It was no surprise to see Ivan Perisic performing so well in Russia but his growing influence for Croatia during the World Cup will have heightened Inter’s valuation of their winger. The 29-year-old has been a key player since arriving at Inter from Wolfsburg three years ago, forging a great understanding with star striker Mauro Icardi and having a direct hand in 52 league goals over the past three seasons. Rejuvenated interest from Manchester United this summer will not just be a consequence of his displays in Russia, but Inter will receive a boosted fee if they decide to sell.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e7bc4e1ea732405f897363df2c64cd30f23dd81/0_1518_8097_4856/master/8097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58d07d47a791d15d909bc25d97534d1c","title":"how to make strawberry tart recipe","story":"For a real showstopper, put fresh strawberries to work in this brilliant summer treatAlthough I’ll go to my grave believing that cooking strawberries for anything but jam is a crime, sometimes the occasion demands a bit more than a punnet of fresh fruit and a cloud of softly whipped cream. This impressive-looking tart is a lighter, simpler take on the classic French pastry, and is designed to let the fruit shine.For the pastry110g cold butter200g plain flour65g caster sugar¼ tsp fine saltFor the filling200ml whipping cream2 tsp icing sugar½-2 tsp rosewater, to taste (optional)200g thick whole-milk yoghurtAbout 500g ripe strawberries4 tbsp redcurrant jelly, or other smooth jam (optional)You could use 375g ready-made sweet shortcrust here, but this is so easy, it’s very little extra effort than shop-bought. Dice the butter and put it in a food processor with the flour, sugar and salt, and pulse for about a minute, until the mix resembles damp sand. Alternatively, put everything in a bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips.Tip the pastry crumbs into a loose-bottomed, shallow, 25cm tart tin, then spread out to cover the base and bank them up around the sides. Press the crumbs with the base of a glass, until you have a solid pastry case, working the crumbs up the edges as well, so the whole tin is evenly coated. Pop it into the freezer and chill for 15 minutes, until firm.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Take the tin out of the freezer, prick the base all over with a fork, then bake for about 20-25 minutes, until crisp and lightly golden all over. Keep an eye on it towards the end of the cooking time, because overcooked pastry tends to crumble once filled.Leave the baked shell to cool completely in the tin, then transfer to a serving plate. If you try to rush this bit and fill the case while it’s still warm, the pastry is liable to go soggy. You may, however, make the pastry case a few hours in advance, in which case keep it in its tin and, once cool, cover with a tea towel.Pour the cream into a large bowl and whip until it’s just starting to hold its shape. Sift in the sugar (this will get rid of any lumps) and add half a teaspoon of rosewater, if using. Different brands vary hugely in strength, so start small: you can always add more later. (For other flavouring ideas, see step 9.)Keep whipping the cream until it forms soft peaks, then fold in the yoghurt. You could use cream alone, but yoghurt gives the tart a lighter, fresher flavour – don’t be tempted to use a reduced-fat variety, though, because that will make it sour and watery. Greek yoghurt, being thicker, may need to be whisked briefly beforehand, to make it easier to incorporate.Taste the cream mix and add more rosewater or sugar, if need be, then spoon into the tart case and smooth out with a spoon or spatula. Wash the strawberries, then hull and cut into quarters (or sixths, if they are on the large side). Arrange neatly on top of the cream, starting in the centre, points facing upwards, in concentric circles or just cut the fruit in half and lay cut side down in neat rows.If you’re happy with a more natural look, you can now serve the tart just as it is. But, for a high-gloss, professional-looking finish, gently heat the jelly or jam in a small pan over a low heat until it melts, then use a pastry brush to paint the strawberries, making sure you don’t drip it on any exposed cream. Leave to set for at least half an hour before serving.The tangy sweetness of a ripe strawberry is a pleasure that needs little in the way of enhancement, but I can’t resist the summery perfume of rose petals. If you’re not keen on those, add a dash of vanilla extract (or the scraped seeds from a vanilla pod), the finely grated zest of an unwaxed lemon or orange, or even some black pepper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5452c5a59418e1c5a1ae237fff4187cc876f7f8a/0_2053_4571_2743/master/4571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3fbe7e113850a91b29c2da68aae288","title":"judy joo spicy korean ramyun noodles recipe","story":"Instant noodles make a great speedy supper – ditch the seasoning packet for your own flavoured stock to take them to new heightsSometimes nothing hits the spot better than instant ramyun (Korean for ramen) and a cold beer.

Creating an event full of Bollywood imagery that lovingly reflects on Indian culture, he deliberately fused it with hip-hop to reflect his – and many other people’s – diasporic experiences growing up with both musical genres. It also reflects people’s potentially fraught experience of embracing their gender identity or sexuality.South Asian communities, even in the UK, often struggle to understand homosexuality and gender fluidity, and Lanji wants to tackle this problem by being radically erse. “I really worried about who should be a part of it and who shouldn’t. In the end, I just invited everyone,” he says, describing the night as “a mosaic” of different lifestyles, genders and sexualities.It’s something you can feel radiating the minute you walk into the club. On a screen in front of the DJ booth are clips of Bollywood music videos ranging from the vintage to the contemporary – almost as a catch-up for anyone new to the genre. From Devdas and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai to Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, it’s a timeline through some of the most iconic moments.Lanji and fellow resident Shimmy Ahmed carefully mimic this with their sets too. They ebb and flow as the pair confidently introduce, or remind, clubbers of momentous songs you’d expect at a big South Asian wedding, except cooler – who knew Soulja Boy or Nelly would mix so well with the camp, poppy sounds of Bollywood? There’s an air of debauchery to the night, which is fitting as “hungama” means something like a cheeky kind of chaos in Urdu. One young woman is wearing a male turban, and there are more Asian men working a stripper’s pole than you’re ever likely to see elsewhere. A man at the night who was neither South Asian nor LGBTQ+, tells me it is radically inviting “in a way I never expected”. By the end, he is playfully bumming a cigarette from a brown drag queen drenched in glittering bridal jewellery. Another attendee, Raheem Mir, known for classic Indian dancing in female drag, comments that the night is “just overloaded with queerness and such an open environment”. “I was quite excited that there aren’t really any rules,” Lanji says. “If we bring people in in a positive way, we can circumvent some of the undertones and issues that we’ve had in the gay Asian community by making something that is truly wholesome and inviting.” The night is held at polis in Bethnal Green, London, which was recently converted from a strip club. It is set to run quarterly, with takeovers also planned for other clubs and bars across London. Having begun in a London pub in May 2017, then running a night in Shoreditch House, and now this, the growth is exponential. Lanji says the polis booking is a personal milestone, as many of his formative clubbing experiences and explorations of queer nightlife were in east London. A female clubber remarks that “there really isn’t anything else like this”. She has come to Hungama with a group of other South Asian friends, one of whom is having a dance off with a blue-faced drag queen (I suspect the reference point is Jadu, an alien from the Bollywood sci-fi movie Koi Mil Gaya). Chatting more, it turns out this was his first time at a queer night. To say he is as immersed as the performers is putting it lightly. While many South Asian parents struggle to accept their children’s sexuality, Lanji feels lucky to have had support from his. “It took them some time to traverse that path, but I know looking back that they were always behind me,” he says. It was still a difficult journey, and Hungama feels like a place where people can finally feel they’ve arrived. “I’ve had a lot of people thanking me for providing the space where people could be truly reminiscent about their upbringing,” Lanji says. “If something like this existed five or 10 years ago, maybe a lot of the heartache and hardship that I went through might not have been so intense, as I would have felt like I was less alone.” Alone is the last thing anyone could feel at Hungama. It might be the excitement at the night finally existing, or at a community that only just formed, but everyone is dancing and cheering throughout. Finishing his set as another starts up, Lanji slinks out of the DJ booth and joins everyone on the floor for a truly permissive celebration of South Asian culture.DJ Mantra – Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyar x Lean OnRyan Lanji: “Two classics in one: my favourite tune from one of the longest running films in Indian history mashed up with an undeniable club banger from Major Lazer.”Raghav – Teri Baaton Mein“Raghav is the Craig David of Bollywood pop music.

Woodcock was suspended in April over accusations that he sent inappropriate texts and messages to a former staff member between 2014 and 2016. There is no suggestion the staff member’s complaint was motivated by the NEC email.But after referring to the suspension and subsequent removal of another person associated with the party because of “a long and colourful list of charges including sexting young women”, the email continued: “If John Woodcock had similarly been suspended … then yes we could have refused to endorse him.”Woodcock, who will now sit as an independent, claims the email is evidence that senior Labour figures were out to get him – and other outspoken critics of Corbyn – long before the disciplinary process he now faces was launched.But Corbyn’s spokesman said the email was “a red herring and a smokescreen”.Woodcock is a longtime and fervent critic of Corbyn’s leadership. He has vehemently denied the claims about sending inappropriate messages. He said he believed senior party figures were determined to rig the disciplinary system to ensure he was not able to stand for re-election, and he complained that details of his case had been leaked to two Sunday newspapers, after which he was suspended.At the May 2017 NEC meeting, some members argued Labour should refuse to endorse Woodcock as a candidate in the forthcoming general election.The sender of the internal email, whose name has been redacted, said that had Woodcock not been endorsed as a candidate, “his lawyers would have had a field day”, and added that if he had been rejected it would have been a distraction during the campaign. “There was a desire to spend the next five weeks talking about Jeremy’s positive agenda, not John Woodcock,” the email said.One senior Labour figure – who did not dispute the sincerity of the allegations against Woodcock – told the : “There was always a group of people in the leader’s office who wanted to hang a couple of our MPs on the right wing of the party out to dry, but wiser heads always prevailed.” They added: “They were really, really going for him”. Another source described a perception that there was “an awkward squad” of MPs.Relations between Woodcock and Corbyn’s team deteriorated sharply after the MP began the 2017 election campaign by posting a video message to constituents saying he wanted to be re-elected for Labour but “will not countenance ever voting to make Jeremy Corbyn Britain’s prime minister”.Woodcock obtained the Labour email as part of a “subject access request”, under which the party was obliged to reveal correspondence about him from several named iniduals, including aides to Corbyn. The email is copied to then party general secretary, Iain McNicol.Woodcock claims the case against him was accelerated when McNicol was replaced by Jennie Formby, a Corbyn ally, this year.In his resignation letter, Woodcock – a former No 10 aide to Gordon Brown and shadow minister – said Labour was “no longer the broad church it has always historically been”.He added: “Antisemitism is being tolerated and Labour has been taken over at nearly every level by the hard left, far beyond the dominance they achieved at the height of 1980s militancy.”In response to the claims, Corbyn’s spokesman said: “The fact is the sexual harassment procedures of the Labour party are robust and independent of political leadership and they end up going through the elected NCC which is where this case would have gone to. “I’m afraid that actually what has happened is that accountability over this case has been lost. If it’s involving people that are unconnected with the disciplinary process then whatever he is referring to is entirely irrelevant. “I’m not aware of anything like that. He’s not the only Labour MP who has often spoken against the party leadership. This is a bit of a red herring and a smokescreen in regard to a serious case that should have been fully investigated.”He also suggested Woodcock should resign his seat and trigger a byelection.

Most likely we would see shortages of products and a sharp rise in prices, turning everyday staples like butter, yoghurts, cheese and infant formula, into occasional luxuries. Speciality cheeses, where there are currently limited options for production, may become very scarce.”The LSE report comes a year to the day after the government was warned that it was “sleepwalking” into a post-Brexit future of insecure, unsafe and increasingly expensive food supplies.Britain’s food production deficit has been put in the spotlight after repeated warnings that the country needs to rely less on imports to feed the population.Britain does not produce enough milk to keep up with demand, creating a dependency on the EU, including on dairy-surplus countries such as Ireland, Germany, France, Belgium and Denmark for everyday items such as cheddar cheese and butter.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal and defaults to World Trading Organisation rules, prices will almost certainly rise as dairy products, along with meat, attract high tariffs. Even if a deal were struck and there were no tariffs, imports would face costly delays at Dover, the report says. LSE estimates that every seven-minute delay at a port such as Dover will add a minimum of £111 extra per container because of extra labour costs.In addition, rules of origin certificates could add €48 (£45), with veterinary controls costing £50.60 per consignment, the LSE finds. The research suggested that small cheese suppliers in France and Italy could find their products uncompetitive in British shops, generating scarcities and, in turn, price rises.Amirahmadi said it was important to be clear that Brexit might bring opportunities to expand the dairy industry in the UK, boosting the country’s declining food security levels. However, he warned that this would take time.“Brexit might bring opportunities to expand the UK industry in the long-term, but in the short- and medium-term we cannot just switch milk production on and off. Increasing the UK’s milk pool and building the infrastructure for us to be self-sufficient in dairy will take years,” he said. Arla is the largest dairy company in the country with a turnover of £2.6bn and supplies the big supermarket chains including Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda with branded and own-label products. It is a pan-European cooperative with production facilities in 11 countries supplied by its 11,200 dairy farmers, 2,400 of which are British.Commenting on the LSE report, Amirahmadi suggested that farmers who owned the Arla dairy cooperative already offered the consumer the best possible price.“There’s no margin to play with here in the value chain,” he said. “Any disruption means that if we don’t get the practicalities of Brexit right we will face a choice between shortages, extra costs that will inevitably have to be passed on to the consumer, or undermining the world-class standards we have worked so hard to achieve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2943d8bd6d280053d9adef2f5ba10ad50f656cd4/0_180_2825_1695/master/2825.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1c556c9a591ac8c0bd7952c761d40de","title":"kate hoey under pressure from labour after siding with tories","story":"MP for Vauxhall angers constituency party who call for party whip to be withdrawnKate Hoey is facing demands to stand down as a Labour MP from members of her constituency party after defying the whip to vote with the Conservatives in Tuesday’s crucial Commons vote.Opponents in her south London seat of Vauxhall have prepared a motion of censure that demands that Jeremy Corbyn withdraws the party whip and stops her from standing again as an MP.At least one ward and one Momentum meeting have already passed the censure motion, which is expected to be put before a constituency meeting next Thursday.The motion reads: “As Labour members who campaigned for Kate Hoey at the last general election despite many of us disagreeing with her about Brexit, we are appalled at the way in which she is demonstrating that her personal views take priority over representing her constituents and our party by voting to enable this rotten, inept government to stay in office.”It demands that “the leader of the Labour party suspend Kate Hoey from the parliamentary Labour party and remove the whip” and that the party’s ruling body, the NEC, should “declare Kate Hoey ineligible for re-selection as a parliamentary candidate.”Hoey said the censure motion was “no surprise”. “Over my 29 years I have been censured numerous times. It’s my constituents that really matter and, hard as it might be for  readers to understand, they include many who voted remain and aren’t obsessed with Brexit.”Hoey’s decision to vote against the party and the motion was discussed on Tuesday night at a Momentum meeting in the Bread and Roses pub in Clapham, south London. A statement from Vauxhall Momentum, which was circulated among local activists, urged members to support a motion of censure that will be put to Vauxhall Labour party’s general committee on 26 July. This is a meeting at which all members can attend but only delegates can vote. One local party activist said that Hoey’s decision to vote with the Tories was being seen as a missed chance missed to bring down Theresa May. Last month, the same general committee passed a motion critical of Hoey which asked the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to meet to discuss the possibility of setting up an early trigger ballot. Hoey’s political demise was predicted before the last general election because of her pro-Brexit stance in an overwhelmingly remain constituency. She became a target of vitriol from some remainers after appearing on a fishing boat with Nigel Farage. Defying predictions, she increased her majority by more than 7,500 votes, which she attributed to young voters enthused by Corbyn’s campaign.

Corbyn listed cabinet ministers who were involved in Vote Leave. He said Vote Leave did not cooperate with the Electoral Commission. Would May make sure they cooperate with the police inquiry?May said Corbyn was making an accusation about ministers and urged him to withdraw it. All those asked to give evidence would respond, she said. Corbyn repeated the Electoral Commission reference and asked for a guarantee that ministers would cooperate. Those cabinet ministers were central to the Vote Leave campaign, and he said the cabinet had now sunk into a mire of ision. With the white paper in chaos, when would a new one be published?May urged Corbyn again to withdraw his remarks. She said everyone was innocent until proven guilty. He had made accusations against ministers that were unjustified.Turning to the white paper, May suggested none of the amendments passed by MPs contradicted government policy. One was about parliamentary scrutiny of plans to form a customs union. The government was planning to leave the customs union anyway. Another prevents a border down the Irish Sea. That was government policy already. And another was about reciprocity on customs. That was in the white paper too.Corbyn asked why, if that was the case, the defence minister had to rebel against the government to support government policy. He said the government had abandoned what he called this “cobbled together mishmash” of a customs policy.May said her facilitated customs arrangement had not been abandoned and was being discussed with the EU.Corbyn asked whether May really thought the EU would agree a deal just to satisfy Tory isions. Wasn’t it the case that the government had no serious negotiating strategy whatsoever?May responded by pointing out differences between her and Corbyn’s Brexit strategies, claiming she would end free movement and Corbyn would keep it. She said she wanted the UK out of the customs union Corbyn didn’t. She was respecting the referendum he wasn’t.Corbyn said the Brexit white paper stated that the UK was committed to membership of the European convention on human rights. Was Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, signed up to this? (Raab is on record as criticising it.)May said support for the ECHR was government policy. It was in the manifesto. She said Corbyn had not been listening to her answers.Corbyn said the government wanted to shut down parliament five days early. It had even given up on negotiating with itself. He accused the government of being too busy with infighting to negotiate a Brexit deal.May hit back by saying that while she had been agreeing on the future of Nato with Donald Trump, Corbyn had been joining a protest against him. While she had been delivering a plan for trade with the EU, Corbyn had been delivering a plan to teach children to go on strike. And while she had been renegotiating Britain’s future relationship with the EU, Corbyn had been redefining the definition of antisemitism.A clear win for May, her easiest for many weeks. Her party may be tanking in the polls, her Chequers Brexit plan may be on life support and her leadership looking as frail as ever (on Tuesday one firm of bookmakers stopped taking bets on her being replaced this summer), but Corbyn could not press this case at PMQs.He asserted it at times, but to win an argument you need more than a slogan and an assertion you have to engage with what you are being told and articulate why it is wrong, and Corbyn didn’t manage this. His best moment was probably when he quoted Raab on the ECHR, but what the prime minister says about government policy now trumps what a minister might have said in the past, pre-appointment, and May knocked back his point successfully. Corbyn’s best topic was Vote Leave, where he was right to say that the role ministers such as Michael Gove did or did not play in Vote Leave’s electoral cheating was a serious matter that merited full investigation. “Nothing to do with me, guv,” is more or less what Gove and other Vote Leave leaders have said about the over-spending revelations. Some people are not convinced. But if you are going to imply that cabinet ministers have been complicit in some form of electoral foul play, you have to be able to make the case. With what sounded like at least a degree of feigned indignation (she seems to get more worked up about ball-tampering in cricket than EU referendum misconduct), May pushed back hard against Corbyn, and at that point, instead of persisting, Corbyn moved on. His next topic was the Brexit white paper and the Brexiter amendments, and he asserted that the government had torn up its own proposals. But when May contested this, with reference to detail, he again failed to stand up his assertion. He then resorted to a generalised broadside about government isions, but May’s counter-attacks – about implementing the EU referendum result more effectively than Corbyn, and her jibe about Corbyn redefining antisemitism – were more convincing. It was about as good a PMQs as she could have asked for before the summer recess.Jeremy Corbyn on the government’s Chequers deal:After two years of dither and delay, the government has sunk into a mire of ision. The agreement that was supposed to unite the cabinet led to the cabinet falling apart within 48 hours. And on Monday the government U-turned to make their own white paper proposals unlawful. Given that the proposals in the white paper are now obsolete, when will the new white paper be published?Theresa May hits back at Corbyn’s last question with a nod to the ongoing controversy over Labour’s handling of antisemitism claims in the party:While I was negotiating our future security relationship with Europe, he was renegotiating the definition of antisemitism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9c29d73dcebb4d84d74d1e6a6d80ee0120cae0/0_26_3344_2006/master/3344.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=365e6eee69e361f92f43bb40d7dd865b","title":"varadkar ireland stepping up plans no deal brexit","story":"Theresa May due to visit Irish border, and Sinn Féin criticised for Commons abstentionsIreland is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit as Theresa May prepares to visit the Irish border.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the instability in Westminster meant there was no guarantee that a withdrawal agreement, even if agreed in Brussels, would get passed in London.“We can’t make assumptions that the withdrawal agreement will get through Westminster,” he said. “It’s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly.”Because of this, he said, his government would step up plans for a no-deal scenario.His deputy, Simon Coveney, will brief the Irish cabinet at a meeting in Kerry on Wednesday about contingency planning, including the recruitment of extra customs officer for ports and airports. On Thursday May is due to arrive in Northern Ireland for a two-day visit. She will visit a border area and meet businesspeople to hear their views. On Friday she will give a speech in Belfast about the government’s Brexit white paper and how it addresses the Irish border issue.She is also due to meet the main Stormont party leaders to try to kickstart a new round of talks on restoring power-sharing in the devolved assembly. Concerns have been raised that an amendment to the customs bill passed in the Commons on Monday night making a border in the Irish Sea unlawful will leave the prime minister unable to deliver a backstop solution for Northern Ireland in the event of no deal.The amendment, supported by Kate Hoey, the Northern Ireland-born MP for Vauxhall in London, went through on a nod on Monday night and makes it illegal for the government to enter into “any agreements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate territory to Great Britain”. May said on Wednesday: “I’ve been clear we will not accept the imposition of any border down the Irish Sea and we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it.” Coveney told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Wednesday that Brexiter amendments to the UK government’s customs and trade bills were “unhelpful”. He said the law banning a border in the Irish Sea could be trumped by the Good Friday agreement, which gives voters the right to self-determination and has the status of an international treaty. Coveney said he did not accept that the amendment made the backstop illegal. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator for Brexit, will advise 27 member states at a European council meeting on Friday to deepen contingency planning. A 15-page EU draft review of the UK white paper, seen by RTÉ, says the consequences of no deal “will be very real for citizens, professionals and business operators”.Separately, Sinn Féin has come under concerted attack north and south of the border from rivals who say its seven MPs could have defeated the Brexiter amendments had it abandoned its Westminster abstentionist policy.Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister and a member of Varadkar’s Fine Gael party, tweeted: “The refusal by Sinn Féin to take up its Westminster seats has plunged the British PM into the clutches of the hard Brexiteers again. Government wins knife-edge vote by wafer thin margin.”Stephen Donnelly, the Brexit spokesman for Fianna Fáil, which is in a supply-and-confidence government with Fine Gael, also criticised Sinn Féin.Sinn Féin has operated an abstentionist policy for 100 years, standing for elections in Northern Ireland but not taking its seats. . The trade bill was passed by just six votes, and amendments to the customs bill were won by three and four votes. “Hardline Brexiteers won last evening’s Westminster vote because of Sinn Féin abstentionism,” the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, said.It is the first time in years that Sinn Féin’s abstentionist policy has come under such a concerted attack. The health minister, Simon Harris, also criticised the party for not taking its chance to influence Brexit policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab344627757ca2eb603210bee773d2e0b92052e/0_126_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75c32e9a9a26134f2d801a18f432f8ed","title":"senior tory criticises may over brexit saying jacob rees mogg is running our country politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and May’s evidence to the Commons liaison committeeIn normal circumstances, if you stand for election on one platform and then decide to abandon the platform you stood on, basic rules of democratic accountability suggest that you should then put that to the electorate.Responding to Baker, who was in charge of “no deal” planning when he was a minister, May said:We take pairing very seriously and we recognise its value to Parliament and we will continue to guarantee a pair for MPs that are currently pregnant or have a newborn baby.She also said the government was “looking very careful” at proposals to allow proxy voting in the Commons.Michael Gove, the environment secrtary, told MPs this morning he was “sure” that Britain could secure a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US even if it insisted on keeping out American products like chlorine-washed chicken. As the Press Association reports, Gove said that it would be “a mistake to under-estimate” President Trump, who he described as a “shrewd negotiator”. He suggested that the president’s unorthodox deal-making style might mean that agreement is possible despite apparent obstacles. Speaking to the Commons European scrutiny committee, Gove said Trump was known to take an unconventional approach to deal-making, using “provocative” gambits to “disorientate” the other side “before coming to a satisfactory conclusion”. While conventional negotiators would respond to a $10 price-tag by offering $5 before eventually settling at $7.50, Mr Trump was more likely to agree the $10 price before suddenly declaring at the last minute that the product was worthless and dropping his offer to one dollar, he said. As the Press Association reports, Gove, who interviewed Trump shortly after his election, said:I wouldn’t necessarily judge this president’s deal-making style by the approach that others classically take towards deals. Because his style is different that doesn’t mean a deal is any more unlikely, it just means the route is rather more of a roller-coaster.Gove also told MPs that officials at the Department of International Trade and his own Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were taking time to make a “close study” of the Trump approach before negotiations on a trade deal with the US began.At PMQs the Conservative MP Keith Simpson asked Theresa May about Donald Trump, with a neat sideswipe at Boris Johnson. Simpson said:I understand that there have been some clarifications of some of the statements that President Trump made, I did raise the incident in Salisbury.The Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, has posted this on John Woodcock leaving the Labour party.Strong words from Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, today on Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin.Writing in the Scotsman, she condemns the US president’s “desperate and dangerous sycophancy”, suggesting that “nothing attracts a wannabe strong man ... like thuggish strength”.Insisting that “America does not conform to Mr Trump’s small and insular vision of it”, she concludes: Let’s not inflate Mr Trump’s ego even more by fearing him too much. Let’s instead remember that our values and our way of life are always stronger than one man alone.As always, the positioning is as interesting as the words themselves, with Davidson - considered by many as a potential party leader - suggests a very different approach to Trump than that recently displayed by Theresa May.

We would like to hear about what you believe is your earliest recollectionIt is a much pondered and discussed subject: your earliest childhood memory. For some, it is their first bee sting or a formative interaction with a parent as a toddler. Others claim to be able to recall lying in a pram. But how sure are you that you have actually remembered this experience, rather than it being informed by photographs and family anecdotes?Professor Martin Conway, director of the Centre for Memory and Law at City, University of London, and co-author of the research, explained what fuels such fictional first memories: “When we looked through the responses from participants, we found that a lot of these first ‘memories’ were frequently related to infancy, and a typical example would be a memory based around a pram. For this person, this type of memory could have resulted from someone saying something like ‘mother had a large green pram’. The person then imagines what it would have looked like. Over time these fragments then become a memory and often the person will start to add things in such as a string of toys along the top.” We are interested to hear what you believe to be your earliest memory.

Nonetheless, one need not scrape far beneath the surface to discover grumblings of discontent.The subject in hand is straightforward for those attending the 147th Open if you leave the venue, you cannot get back in with the same ticket. Exceptions will be made on medical grounds, just as members of golf clubs affiliated to Carnoustie – who have bought advance season tickets and meet identification criteria – can come and go. This R\u0026ampA position, adopted last year and due to continue in 2019 at Portrush, is contrary to what occurs at Augusta National, the US\u0026nbspOpen and\u0026nbspWimbledon.Several months ago an online petition was launched by David Valentine, the proprietor of Simpson’s Golf Shop, which sits across the street from the Carnoustie links. By the time he stopped publicising it, close to 700 signatures had been added.The wording was strong: “The R\u0026ampA’s ‘No‑readmission’ policy will effectively lock them on‑course all day – every day unless they pay again. This goes against the 150-year-old tradition of the Open and is not in the interests of spectators who are – only now – beginning to realise the full effects of these restrictions.”Speaking this week, Valentine made it clear he is not at war with the R\u0026ampA but a degree of unrest remains. “The petition is still live so fans of the Open can give feedback about the policy,” he said. “Most local people agree the Open is the best golf event on the planet and the R\u0026ampA should be commended for helping juniors to come free and stay at the new campsite.“But there is a growing disappointment by local people with elderly relatives, young children, pets and local businesses because the new policy doesn’t allow them to pop out and back in, to take care of their responsibilities.“Frankly this should have been sorted by the Links Management who are custodians of the courses on behalf of the people who own them.” Therein lies a key Carnoustie distinction its three courses, including the championship one, are owned by the town.The Open is an expensive day out. Adult tickets for tournament days start at £80, though early bird tickets were available. The addition of a £4.50 bacon roll, £5 pint of lager, £10 burger and chips or £6 salad box may be avoided by some spectators if there was a chance to visit Carnoustie’s pubs and eateries before returning.Yet the R\u0026ampA remains adamant that its objective is not to squeeze every last penny from customers. Unofficial – or “pirate” – hospitality, which has been a huge and recurring headache at the Open, is its explanation. “That is a real issue for us,” said the R\u0026ampA chief executive, Martin Slumbers. “It degrades the Open. It undermines that fan experience and we have decided that the no-readmission policy is a core way, along with other things that we are doing, to reduce unofficial hospitality. That’s the primary reason.”Intrigue will naturally surround whether the R\u0026ampA retains this in its home of St\u0026nbspAndrews, where the Open will return in 2021. Businesses in the town, like Carnoustie within easy walking distance of the golf course, have a deep-rooted relationship with golf’s ruling body.In Carnoustie the inference is of a cooler alliance. Bill Thompson is captain of Carnoustie Golf Club, whose 800 members have links playing status. Their clubhouse sits adjacent to the Open.“The reality is that for approximately the last six weeks we have had a major disruption with regards the availability of golf courses to members,” he said. “That also has a massively negative effect on our commercial viability members don’t play, they don’t come into the club. We understand that’s a necessary evil but there is no compensation to us. If we get a marquee winner here, for the next 10 years everybody benefits but in the short-term it is difficult.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ca7f642d760fd5817ecf256950a864f0c35c9d/0_163_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18bf333324b0d26185591c880b61a5a","title":"talking horses fretting over the bhas case against tim brennan","story":"Racing’s regulator appears to have no direct evidence the Brennan brothers spoke on the critical day or that Faugheen was lame thenI see from social media that some have not grasped how circumstantial the case is against the vet Tim Brennan, who has been facing a regulatory hearing at the British Horseracing Authority. Brennan, principal vet to Willie Mullins, denies a charge of having shared inside information about Faugheen with his brother, Michael, and the independent panel will publish its verdict this week.I turned up on Monday morning expecting the BHA case to be strong, on the basis of what little information was known. When you hear that a vet’s brother bet against a horse we all thought was healthy when in fact it was crocked, well, it sounds damning.But after years of investigation, a series of interviews and the probing of betting records, phone records and veterinary records, the BHA case has not advanced beyond the circumstantial. I’m sure it seemed a worthwhile case to pursue but one can’t always anticipate the holes a hearing may expose in a case. Mullins gave evidence that, on 15 February 2016, which is when Michael Brennan began to lay Faugheen for the Champion Hurdle, the horse appeared sound. It was the first time Faugheen was ridden after being sore in the wake of his previous race, and he evidently showed no immediate ill effects, having done no more than walk for several days. As you’ve probably heard trainers say in relation to many other horses, it took until the following day for the horse to show he was lame once more, in the wake of exercise. But the BHA barrister, Philip Evans QC, argued the horse must have shown signs of lameness after being ridden, making it clear he could not win the Cheltenham race, signs which Tim Brennan relayed to his brother, triggering the betting. If there was no negative information to share that day, Evans’s case fails. Is a panel likely to just ignore what Mullins told it? Evans suggested Mullins’s memory may be letting him down about the state of Faugheen on the 15th but the barrister could produce no alternative evidence that the horse was in fact lame that day, beyond saying the betting evidence would not make sense if he were sound. But that evidence would make sense if Michael Brennan had placed his bets in response to a rumour about the horse’s health which he’d heard from a source other than his brother the panel heard there were several routes by which rumours might have flowed to Michael from the nearby Mullins yard. In evidence, Tim Brennan did not just say the thing that would best suit his defence. Evans asserted the brothers must have spoken on the 15th, though he had no direct proof rather than deny it, Tim readily admitted they might have done, but insisted he would never have shared secrets with anyone about the horses under his care. I’d have liked to hear more about his relationship with Michael, said to be a regular gambler who was “embarrassed” at having got his brother into trouble through his betting but who nonetheless refused to assist in extricating him, the panel was told. We’ll get the panel’s view on Tim Brennan in a few days but have they really heard enough to justify blowing a hole in a professional person’s livelihood and making a finding of dishonesty against him?Turning to today’s action, the nap is Ange Des Malberaux (2.50) at Uttoxeter, where 10-11 is the price as Dan Skelton’s charge makes his chase debut off the same mark as the one from which he scored over hurdles on Saturday. Skelton should follow up with I’m Always Trying (3.50), another last-time winner, at 7-4. But his Weightfordave could be vulnerable to the 11-4 shot Competition (3.20) from the on-fire yard of Dr Newland.

Jacob emails in: “For anyone who has not cycled on french roads, i would like to point out that almost without exception, they are beautiful butter smooth things of great joy for the cyclist.”Even the mountains?Alaphlippe, Barguil and Thomas De Gendt opened up a big lead on the rest of the leaders when surging down the mountain. Alex emails in. “John, it may look slow, but Sky are steaming up the mountains at such as pace, no other team can shake it up. They might get over the first climb ahead, but are shattered for the climbs ahead. That’s why Sky win so much.”He’s right, of course.Here’s a French supermarket giving the results from the Bisanne climb. The peloton reaches the top of the Bisanne, as the leaders speed away on the descent. Sky fully in control with Chris Froome mob-handed. Perhaps our next climb, the Col du Pré, will see some GC fireworks. Here’s footage of our first summit climb of the day.Stephanie DMs on Twitter (they are open): “Hi, did Lawson Craddock start stage 11?He did, and he is in the main peloton. Heroic stuff for someone with a broken scapula. Now 5’ 23” clear of the peloton, the leaders race on to take the mountain points. Alaphilippe extends his points lead, and Barguil, last year’s mountains winner, takes second, and that could be a battle to look out for during the rest of the Tour. Rein Taarmae, in second in the classification before today, could not go with them. More from Gary Naylor: “Stage after stage, the GC teams allow Sky to control the race in the delusion that they will crack. Can’t 2 or 3 get together and form an ad hoc alliance for a few days and put Sky into the red early on? Cycling used to be full of such deals and was better for it.”Yes, memories of Robert Millar and Stephen Roche sticking together in the 1987 Giro (plus others), and in the 1986 Vuelta, Spanish teams ganging up on Millar to deny him the Vuelta. Good skulduggery in those days. Metatone replies to Our Gaz: “Also find it bizarre that Movistar have 3 “big guns” but never wheel them out...”Another good point.In that main group of GC contenders, both Movistar, of Nairo Quintana, and Vincenzo Nibali’s Bahrain team are letting Sky take the strain. The leading trio just ahead of a group of pursuers are Barguil, Alaphilippe and Tejay van Garderen. They failed to escape, and will now let the rest catch them up. Safety in numbers at this stage of the race there are 85km or so to go. This is a brutal climb to begin the day with. The breakaway is 4’ 15” or so clear of a peloton that is dwindling in numbers. Sprinters are being spat to the back, including Marcel Kittel. The actual Gary Naylor has tweeted in. “These short stages are analogous to Twenty20 cricket - spectacular, but the canvas is too small. Stages like Pantani’s win at Les Deux Alpes in 1998 need the ebb and flow of valley roads and not just the punch and attack of mountain terrain to be truly epic.”Oof! Alaphilippe nearly came a cropper when the neutral car almost cut him up on the narrow track that passes for a road in this part of the Alps. The Frenchman was not at all impressed and shook his head in the dismissive manner so often seen on the streets of London. Mark Cavendish already dropped off the peloton and surely headed for the grupetto. Demare is back there too. Neil Grunshaw sends in another of his excellent animated gifs, staying on the subject of Alaphilippe. His Twitter page is well worth a follow. Luke Rowe is leading Team Sky’s tempo up this climb with the yellow jersey. The sprinters who headed up the hill for the intermediate are dropping off. Sagan has gone, and Warren Barguil, one of the great enigmas of cycling, is leading the group at the top of the course. Alaphilippe clearly wants to keep the King of the Mountains jersey, and is pursuing the pack. Here’s where those hard yards begin with that climb to Bisanne, just the 12.4km to deal with. It’s a hellish start to the climbs, and just the second time it has appeared in the Tour during 2016’s ride to Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc, as won by Romain Bardet. France’s great hope, who has not been in good nick so far, can only dream of being in such form at the moment. He is 4’ 11” off the lead, and about 1’ 40” behind Geraint Thomas. Real head of steam from the Sagan group, who are pushing up to 2 minutes clear, and Sagan takes in the intermediate sprint. The man in green does not sit up, even if his job is done for the day, and is now helping out his compadres in the breakaway.We are already under 100km to go, though none of those km are easy km. The first group have 20 seconds on a chasing group including Alaphilippe and Philippe Gilbert, with the peloton around 40 second behind. A few wildcat attacks off the front of the top group. About 20 riders clear at the moment, including Sagan, with a tailwind behind them. Team Sky meanwhile already making the pace in the peloton. Here’s an interview with the same girl 25 years on. Sagan is right to the forefront and Alaphilippe is with him. Damiano Caruso of BMC takes it out from the start. The riders hit the départ réel and many of the sprinters are at the front. There is an intermediate sprint at 11km in. A mechanical in the pack slightly delays kilometre zero and the flag drop before Christian Prudhomme waves them away. They go from the gun. We begin at Albertville, the site of the 1992 Winter Olympics, where Tonya Harding performed to this dainty number and finished sixth, behind Nancy Kerrigan in bronze. Tonya worked on a plan for next time around.By far the best racing of yesterday came in La Course, with a truly thrilling finish. Here’s the excellent Jeremy Whittle on the context it can be placed in. The stage is only 108.5 km (67 miles), the second shortest non-time trial stage of the Tour. Geraint Thomas, speaking on TV just there, suggested the attacks will begin on the first climb, though the expectation is that the penultimate climb, a category two to the Cormet de Roselend, is where the fireworks begin. The first two climbs are hors catégorie with the final climb a category one.  The Critérium du Dauphiné, the warm-up race for the big one, visited today’s summit finish, the first of the Tour. La Rosière has never hosted Le Tour before and it looks...gruelling. In terms of an intro to the mountains, yesterday’s stage managed to both thrilling and a little disappointing. Up the front, Julian Alaphilippe rode a spectacular stage, and could have rolled a cigarette and quaffed champagne on the final few kilometres, such was the gap to the rest. And Greg Van Avermaet showed guts and initiative in going with the breakaway to extend his lead. Not bad for a one-day classic puncheur rider.Behind all that jazz, Team Sky locked down the GC contenders with a display of defensive might that Didier Deschamps and Jose Mourinho would probably appreciate. Van Avermaet’s adventures stopped Geraint Thomas’ challenge for yellow in its tracks and it will take a fairly spectacular if not impossible crack from the Belgian leader for “G” to claim his prize. It may not be long until Thomas has to accept the role of dutiful servant to Chris Froome, from whom we are to see anything much than a series of minor crashes, dodgy mechanics and wobbles. Then again, we saw each of those in the Giro and look what happened there. And we also know very little about Nairo Quintana, Vincenzo Nibali and Adam Yates’ form, too, with luckless Richie Porte already abandoned. Is this a day to splinter the pack? It may well be that powder is kept dry for Alpe D’Huez which follows on Thursday, but the finish up La Rosière could sort les homme from les enfants, though another breakaway is likely.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8523949ad20fae868cfdd1cdf98887f270aed7/0_172_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5c474c888e79a05c252b50f449e821b","title":"make your own history with a tour of irelands ancient east","story":"For a road trip less ordinary, sail across the Irish Sea to experience the finest medieval castles, prehistoric stone circles and culinary hotspots the Emerald Isle has to offer. By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

He doesn’t wear a battered fedora or carry a whip. He has never raced through the desert on camels in a quest for the holy grail, or fought his way out of buried Egyptian tombs on the trail of the lost ark. But to graphic designers, animators, typographers and font aficionados he has done something far more impressive: he brought hidden fonts back to life and, with the help of an international group of design students, has, in his own words, “liberated them from the drawing board”.These are no ordinary fonts, either, but fonts created by students of the Bauhaus. Founded in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis for its political and aesthetic radicalism in 1933, the Bauhaus had an inestimable impact on the art and architecture of the 20th century, and its approach to typography continues to inspire designers to this day.“Bauhaus is the most famous design school and every design student knows about it,” says Rufus Deuchler, principal manager of Creative Cloud evangelism at software company Adobe. “Adobe’s Hidden Treasures concept is all about bringing back to life pieces of art from the past, and we came up with the idea of tracking down the lost fonts of Bauhaus.”Adobe has form when it comes to bringing art treasures back to life it enabled designers and artists to paint with digitally recreated versions of the brushes of celebrated artist Edvard Munch when it launched its Hidden Treasures concept last year.As part of the project, digital artists around the world submitted their version of The Scream, Munch’s most famous work the winner got to see their work hanging next to the original painting in the Munch Museum in Oslo.Reviving the fonts of the Bauhaus was a very different task. First of all, Spiekermann had to track down the original fonts themselves, which meant trawling through the archives at the Bauhaus school in Dessau – one of the three original Bauhaus school buildings – which stored everything when the school was abruptly shut down.With help from Adobe and Bauhaus, Spiekermann discovered hundreds of artworks, posters, sketches and student exercises that had been kept flat in drawers and art portfolios for nearly 100 years. Some were just fragments, while others were more complete works, but working with a group of international design students, the typographer was able to select five different font designs and set about bringing them back to life. Just being in the presence of original Bauhaus work was incredibly moving, says Spiekermann. “The minute the work is unwrapped, you’re back to 90 years ago and in the presence of the students themselves,” he says. “The rooms were stark – black and white with a little bit of colour every now and then – but they were also airy, with lots of light, so they were geometric in a very liberating, pleasant way, and there was a kind of joyful starkness about the building.“You can imagine these guys in their 20s sweating over their creations, sketching away while a strict professor told them to draw straight lines and not to smudge their work,” he says. “It was a physical and emotional joy for us, as we could not only look at their work but smell and touch it too. It’s like seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time: you have seen it in books and countless reproductions, but all of a sudden you think: ‘Oh my god, this is different.’ It was magic.”Rather than the perfect digital images we are used to, Spiekermann loved seeing the imperfections of the work. “They used glue and pencil and all the things we don’t use any more,” he says. “Everything nowadays is virtual, which can also mean that it doesn’t exist. But this is atoms, not pixels, and close up you can see the imperfections in the work because it’s all hand-drawn.”The original Bauhaus typefaces were created mainly for a specific poster or an exercise in class, meaning that the students didn’t design the whole font. However, out of the fragments of the artworks, Spiekermann and his students created whole alphabets.“They really surprised us with their passion for these fonts,” says Deuchler. “Creating a font is an incredibly complex process, which takes not only hard work and discipline but knowledge. It’s not just a matter of drawing a letter – A, B, C and so on. It’s about the understanding of how an alphabet works.”With the first two lost Bauhaus fonts already being available for download through Adobe – three more will follow in the coming months – the next generation of artists have wasted no time in getting to grips with the new type. “We are already seeing a whole lot of engagement from designers all over the world using those fonts, which is really exciting to see,” says Deuchler. Launched at the recent three-day Adobe Live event, the fonts have received a “very positive reaction” from designers, says Deuchler.“What I find really interesting is that for the younger generation, who don’t necessarily know about the Bauhaus, there’s this whole opportunity to learn history. It’s like opening a history book and seeing how modern and relevant these things are – it’s a teachable moment.” To mark the launch of The Lost Alphabets of Bauhaus, Adobe has launched a series of five challenges encouraging creatives to use these fonts for the very first time and win prizes, including an all-expenses-paid trip to Dessau, Germany to visit the Bauhaus archives.

How can we ensure new tools such as big data and artificial intelligence are a force for good?Wherever humans go, we leave little trails of data behind us. There are the digital bits – Facebook profiles, mailing lists, search histories – and there is the treasure trove our bodies can produce. Smart watches can pick up changes in skin conductivity that indicate how stressed you are, and sleep trackers can monitor how much you’re moving at night, to determine whether you’ve had the recommended eight hours’ kip. And, increasingly, we’re seeing wearables move out of the home and into the workplace.In 2015, BP in North America distributed 24,500 fitness trackers to employees and their partners, and offered staff money off their health insurance if they met their exercise goals. Other companies, including the Bank of America, Kimberly-Clark, Time Warner and Target are also offering their employees similar trackers.But workplace wearables are about much more than fitness alone. At a factory in Hangzhou, China, employees have been given helmets with embedded sensors that allegedly monitor brainwaves and can detect when employees are feeling angry or depressed. In Amsterdam, financial traders experimented with a bracelet that measures emotions through electrodermal activity, using light patterns and colours to indicate when they are in a heightened emotional state. The idea is that if people are more aware of their feelings, they are more likely to rethink their decisions and less likely to act recklessly.But how do we, as humans, feel about all this data gathering? “For a long time, people looked at wearables as if they might be a big brother-type scenario, to do with surveillance within the organisation,” says Chris Brauer, director of innovation at the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London. “But now they’re viewed more as an opportunity to gather evidence to substantiate things that are going on in the workplace.”There’s also the argument that cold data can provide an unbiased picture of how people are feeling and why they might be acting in a certain way. “If an employee is really stressed, they’re unlikely to report that to their employers for fear that it’ll be seen as a projection of weakness,” says Brauer. “What wearables do is provide evidence-based data that’s accurate and therefore indicative of what’s going on.”However, there are fears that companies might use wearables to keep tabs on employees. In January, Amazon was granted a patent on a wristband that could pinpoint the location of warehouse employees and buzz if they were about to place an item in the wrong section. The online retailer has also used tracking technology to make sure its warehouse employees don’t fall below a certain level of productivity.It’s not just warehouse employees who are subjected to digital surveillance – there is a whole industry that produces software to keep an eye on office workers. There are programmes that track keystrokes and cross-reference those against screenshots automatically grabbed from employees’ screens to make sure they’re working. In January 2016, the Daily  removed sensors it had installed that used heat and motion detection to monitor whether people were at their desks.In other professions, however, keeping track of employees can be a matter of life or death. Australian company Seeing Machines develops computer vision systems that can recognise when a driver is distracted or about to fall asleep at the wheel. Currently, the eye-tracking system is used to detect the fatigue levels of truck drivers, pilots, train drivers and people who operate heavy machinery.Even though wellness regimes might add to company productivity in the long run, Murden says it’s important that companies don’t run staff ragged. “We’re not just computers, you can’t just switch us on and expect us to keep going and going,” she says. “But when you support a team properly and they’re working to their absolute optimum, that’s when they’ll flourish.”For Murden, bringing a workforce up to its full potential can involve a broad range of approaches. Sometimes Push Mind and Body prescribes Beyoncé dance classes, or sets up workshops that help people learn how to use stress to their advantage. Murden also teaches employees how to prep their meals for the working week, or recommends one-on-one psychotherapy sessions.Part of the problem with the modern workplace is that it can be difficult for people to manage their workloads, says Chintan Patel, chief technologist at Cisco UK and Ireland. For all the benefits they bring, the ubiquity of smartphones and laptops means that the line between work and home is more blurred than ever before. “If I can access something from my mobile device, does that mean I’m contactable 24 hours a day and need to be responding all the time?” he asks.But instead of turning us into drones, there is the possibility that technology could eventually help to make us feel a little more human at work. Brauer says that it might not be such a bad thing if the most repetitive parts of our jobs do become automated, because this would free up our time and energy to do things that humans are really good at.Some artificial intelligence (AI) systems can already detect from a photograph whether a mole or freckle is cancerous faster than dermatologists. This could be good news for doctors and patients, Brauer says. “They can reinvest that time in professional development, research, or spending more time with their families or patients.”“The technology that’s coming is offering us rehumanising potential,” Brauer says, as long as companies use it as an opportunity to retrain their employees and increase their skills, rather than letting it displace human workers altogether. Patel agrees. With Cisco he’s already thinking about how he can use AI to replace the most repetitive parts of his employees’ days and give them more time to get on with work that excites them, or to concentrate on self-development.We’re already seeing AI tools start to trickle into the mainstream. Smart compose features, which cut down on the need for repetitive typing within emails, are becoming a reality. Virtual personal assistants are becoming more useful – and less of a novelty – with every update. Recently, Google even showcased its assistant booking a hair appointment over the phone.The internet giant reckons voice assistants will soon go the way of wearables and make the shift from being a device we’re used to using in our homes, to one that is commonplace in the office too.As long as this technology is used to empower rather than oppress workers, Brauer is optimistic about the future of the workplace. In the not-too-distant future, many of us will be part of augmented workforces in which people work alongside machines and AI systems that help achieve more with our time, while allowing us to break free from the most mind-numbing parts of our jobs. Technology, it seems, might be just what we need to stop us turning into robots after all.Click here to discover how Cisco can help your SME growIllustration by Bewilder.tv for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9695faf0a2a0eb2b5caf3ecc01d294bd480154b/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eff3853b5d963ad7bdb8355c5f591ff","title":"philadelphia opioid safe injection site plan","story":"More than 1,200 people died of accidental overdoses in the city last year – could bringing users in off the street be the answer?A young man folded over his knees in the stairwell of the El train station at Kensington Avenue and Somerset Street doesn’t look well. A syringe is by his feet.Another man, who moments before was also passed out on the steps, tears open a package of naloxone hydrochloride, a prescription nasal spray that reverses an opioid overdose. “Don’t use it unless he really needs it,” says the woman who handed it to him.The nozzle is shoved up the man’s nostril, and a couple of minutes later he snorts in a long breath and his eyes stretch open. Someone shouts “He’s good!” and everyone returns to their business on this corner of North Philadelphia, ground zero for the city’s opioid epidemic.Now Philadelphia is among a handful of US cities – including Seattle, New York and San Francisco – that wants to open the country’s first safe-injection site, or in the city’s parlance, Comprehensive User Engagement Site (Cues).A safe-injection site would allow users to come in and use their drugs with medical staff on hand in case of an overdose. They would also be able to get clean needles, or be connected to other services such as detox and treatment. But the priority is preventing deaths.“We have to make every effort we can to keep them alive long enough to get them in treatment,” said James Garrow, spokesman for the Philadelphia department of public health.The city believes setting up a site could save up to 76 lives a year.But here in Kensington, a neighborhood renowned for heroin use, opinions vary among addicts and those seeking to give them help.“I’m for it but I also don’t believe that anybody down here would go to these places,” said Jim Kelly, 37, a volunteer at the Last Stop recovery house next door to the Somerset Street subway station. “Because they want to do it as soon as they get it – and that’s coming from experience.”“I’m pro,” said Damaris Vega, 46, who along with her daughter and grandson was giving out ham and cheese sandwiches, bottled water, watermelon slices and ice pops from the trunk of a car. “It’ll keep the needles off the street. It’ll keep them safer. It’ll save their lives.”Dennis W declined to give his last name but said he was 35, lived in the neighborhood, and had been sober just over two years. He described a story he heard on NPR about the government-run safe-injection site in Vancouver, which opened in 2003, and how it allows users to come in and unpack their drugs.“It sounds super weird,” he said. “Obviously if there’s AC and shit, people will want to go in there.”When he was shooting heroin, he said, he preferred to do it alone at the nearby railroad tracks or in abandoned houses – “places that you die because you’re by yourself”.Elaine Gessler, 46, another former user who lives in an apartment the next block over, believed a safe-injection site would help on multiple fronts – from keeping people from shooting up in front of kids to providing them with basic needs like clean water.“I saw a man this morning right under the El. He had a bar of soap and he was cleaning out an open wound in a puddle,” she said. “They use puddle water to inject and shoot up with that.”According to Philadelphia’s managing director’s office, the city is still looking for organizations to fund and operate the site, and it does not have a location. A spokesperson said the city doesn’t expect the site to open until next year. There are also legal questions to iron out.Safe-injection sites are illegal under federal law. The Department of Justice released a statement last year that said users and workers at the sites could be criminally charged and the properties subject to forfeiture.Pennsylvania’s governor, Tom Wolf, hasn’t backed the Cues either. His support, drug policy experts say, could deter the feds from taking a hardline approach.Rallying community support and overcoming local opposition will also take time and effort.The local author, journalist and radio host Solomon Jones is an outspoken critic of safe-injection sites and what he sees as the “gentrification of addiction”.“As somebody who now has almost 22 years clean, what is now being called harm reduction is really in my view, and the view of many addicts, enabling,” Jones said. But his bigger objection is to the difference in “the way crack was treated because it was seen as a black and brown issue and the way that heroin is being treated – both here and nationally – because it’s seen as a white issue”.“I think the response is steeped in racism,” he said.According to a Pew analysis of CDC data, white males have the highest rate of overdose deaths in Philadelphia, with 45- to 54-year-olds hardest hit. “So if we’re now saying that running a legal drug house is fine for people shooting drugs then we need to give people their houses back, their cars back, their money back – all the stuff that was confiscated from black and brown people during the so-called war on drugs here in Philadelphia,” Jones said. “We need to make the black and brown community whole.”Gilberto Gonzalez, a graphic designer and community activist in Kensington who ran for state representative earlier this year, worries a safe-injection site in the neighborhood will cause more violence as dealers fight for corners surrounding the site.Although research on sites in Vancouver and Australia found they did not increase crime in the surrounding areas, Gonzalez is skeptical.“I don’t know anything about Vancouver but in North Philly, in Kensington, those drug dealers are violent,” he said.Gonzalez doesn’t oppose helping people with addiction, but says other priorities need to be dealt with first – like drug-free school zones, needle-free parks and outreach to the dealers on the corners.“I’ve talked to these kids. Most of them can’t read or write but they want a job. Why don’t we get them in community college and certificate programs where they can get skills?” he said. “Why don’t they help them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b29e4754558538119138acf55d9e508c4a77ac2/0_83_1721_1033/master/1721.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd7e406c1af3d079aec33d24affa0719","title":"champagne and roses on first ethiopia eritrea flights in two decades","story":"First commercial flight since peace deal takes off from Addis Ababa heading for AsmaraThe passengers fastened their seatbelts and settled in for the 80-minute morning flight. Ethiopian Airlines ET0312 took off, much as hundreds of other planes making short-haul hops between neighbouring capitals do.But this was no ordinary commercial flight: it was Ethiopian Airlines’ first in two decades to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. In celebratation, according to journalists on board, champagne was served along with red roses.The two countries have been locked in a tense military standoff since the border war that began in 1998 and caused the deaths of about 70,000 people.A new political order in Ethiopia has given rise to an abrupt thawing in relations between the country with Africa’s fastest-growing economy and its young, underdeveloped but self-reliant neighbour.Since taking over in April, the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has released dissidents from prison and liberalised parts of the economy. The state-run airline, telecoms and energy companies could all be sold off to “unleash the potential of the private sector”, a minister told Reuters on Wednesday.In a historic visit, Ahmed flew into Asmara 10 days ago, and was met by his Eritrean counterpart, the long-time president Isaias Afwerki, with warm embraces and laughter. They agreed to implement a peace agreement signed in Algiers in 2000.A week later, Afwerki spent three days in Addis Ababa.On Monday, Eritrea reopened its embassy in Addis Ababa, which had been frozen in time with its floral-patterned formal armchairs set around coffee tables, all covered in a thick layer of dust. Family members of former embassy staff still smiled out from framed portraits on a dressing table, near which lay a crate of 20-year-old unopened beer bottles.The resumption of regular flights is another symbol of the detente between the two countries.Ethiopian Airlines said tickets for the flight sold out in less than an hour. There were 300 seats on the plane, and many of the passengers were thought to have been separated from their families by the conflict.“Family reunion,” Ethiopian Airlines tweeted, along with a pre-dawn picture of the pilots waiting in the cockpit.Eritrea’s information minister tweeted the arrival of the flight in Asmara to a warm red-carpet welcome, with the flags of both nations displayed.Sipping coffee as they waited for the flight were Ethiopia’s former prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn and the former first lady Roman Tesfaye. Desalegn told Reuters: “It is heartfelt joy. There has been hatred between us for the last 20 years. Now that has been reversed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Third brother who pleaded guilty to impeding investigation to be sentenced later in monthInvestigative programme showed Dublin-based moderators retained abusive postsGroup objecting to project tells D\u0026aacuteil committee that route is already well served by LuasParliamentary watchdog finds DUP North Antrim MP breached Westminister rulesCork man will manage Manchester United past players against a CelticRepublic of Ireland selection in tribute to late teammateAccused to appear in court after arrest of two people on Howth Road on MondayYouth, being held in Oberstown detention centre, tells judge he is getting on \u0026lsquogood\u0026rsquoJudge rules Alan Thawley did not meet legal test to be joined as a notice party to caseSon and daughter claimed their father may not have had capacity to make his 2011 willCourt of Appeal rejects prosecution case after hearing \u0026lsquovery sad evidence\u0026rsquo about two elderly sistersReview widely rejected as lack of education and political urgency blamed for shortfallIrish Water says likely to be next week before decision made on need for more restrictionsExplosive devices were hurled at homes of Adams and Bobby Storey on Friday nightBritish prime minister\u0026rsquos two-day visit will include trip to the border areaMichael Quirk believes farmers are key to meeting Ireland\u0026rsquos climate change targetsIt is believed all means of communication were lost when boat was submergedForensic examination of damaged buildings is expected to get underway on WednesdayRegina Doherty responds to questions on biometric data following order to change website\u0026rsquos privacy statementCabinet to be briefed on Brexit preparations Minister says \u0026lsquolegislation can be changed\u0026rsquoStolen credit card details used to pay for flights, toys, hotels, clothes, jewellery"},{"url":null,"title":"inside the ryanair flight that made an emergency landing","story":"  July 14, 2018People seen bleeding from ears after Dublin flight to Croatia makes emergency landing   July 14, 2018Croatia-bound flight in emergency landing   July 16, 2018Airline says \u0026lsquosmall number\u0026rsquo of passengers treated as a precaution after the incident "},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568872.1531908735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may to make brexit reassurance visit to northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May will be in Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday. Photograph: Matt CardyGetty ImagesThe British prime minister Theresa May will make a two-day visit to Northern Ireland this week, Downing Street said on Wednesday morning.The purpose of the trip will be to reaffirm her “commitment to the union and a Brexit that works for the whole United Kingdom”. She will also say there will be no hard border with the Republic and no border “down the Irish Sea”.Downing Street said that Ms May will be in Northern Ireland over Thursday and Friday in a trip that will include a visit to the border area.Her spokeswoman said Ms May will meet business people at the border and listen to their views on the UK quitting the European Union. She will hear “what working, living and trading across the border means to them”.She will also meet young people in Belfast and speak to them about their vision for Northern Ireland’s future.“The prime minister will reaffirm her commitment to a Brexit that avoids a hard border and protects the Belfast Agreement,” said the spokeswoman.Ms May will deliver a speech on Friday in Belfast “which will emphasise her personal commitment to the strength of the UK’s four nations and the solutions set out in the White Paper that address Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances”.She is also expected to meet the North’s political parties to discuss how to restore the powersharing Northern Executive.“I look forward to hearing views from businesses on the border in Northern Ireland on our departure from the European Union,” said Ms May on Wednesday. “I fully recognise how their livelihoods, families and friends rely on the ability to move freely across the border to trade, live and work on a daily basis.“That’s why we have ruled out any kind of hard border. Daily journeys will continue to be seamless and there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border to get in the way of this.“I’ve also been clear we will not accept the imposition of any border down the Irish Sea and we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it.“From the start of the negotiations, the UK government has put Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances at the heart of our negotiations. And nothing will undermine our commitment to protecting the Belfast Agreement.“I also look forward to meeting political parties on working together to restore stable and effective devolved government for the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3568914.1531917517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley faces 30 day suspension over sri lanka holidays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA lawyer for  Ian Paisley said ‘my client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received’. Photograph: PA  North Antrim MP Ian Paisley should be suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days for failing to detail two family holidays to Sri Lanka paid for by the Sri Lankan government, the Westminster committee on standards has recommended. The Westminster Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone found that Mr Paisley had breached parliamentary rule by not registering the holidays and also for lobbying on behalf of the Sri Lankan government.The suspension is due to begin on September 4th this year, at a time when there could be crucial Brexit votes at Westminster and when British prime minister Theresa May is dependent on DUP votes to remain in power.There is also the possibility that a petition could be organised in North Antrim that would force a by-election in the constituency.The DUP in a brief statement said it had noted the findings of the House of Commons standards committee and that “these matters will now be considered by the party officers”.Mr Paisley and his family made two visits to Sri Lanka in MarchApril 2013 and July 2013. These visits were paid for by the Sri Lankan government. The Daily  reported in September last year that the cost of the visits was £100,000 and that he may have been in breach of the rule prohibiting paid advocacy.At the time Mr Paisley said the claims were “devoid of fact or logic” and threatened defamation proceedings against the newspaper. He also referred himself to the investigation by the commissioner. Ms Stone’s investigation confirmed that visits were not registered in the parliamentary register of members’ financial interests when under parliamentary rules hospitality of more than £660 must be registered.While the commissioner found the precise value of the hospitality could not be precisely calculated, “they were of a value significantly in excess of the then registration threshold of £660”. And while The Daily  estimated the cost of the holidays for Mr Paisley and his family at £100,000 the North Antrim MP accepted an estimate of about £50,000.On the MarchApril 2013 visit the commissioner reported how Mr Paisley was accompanied by five family members and on the July 2013 visit he was accompanied by three family members. “The Sri Lankan government paid for those family members to receive business-class air travel, accommodation at ‘first class’ hotels, and helicopter flights to tourist destinations,” said the commissioner.“Although Mr Paisley initially described these two visits to Sri Lanka as ‘official visits’ (on the grounds that he held meetings with and received briefings from government ministers and officials), for his accompanying family members they were clearly holidays,” the commissioner added in her report. “None of the benefits received by Mr Paisley’s family members could be argued to have contributed to his gaining knowledge about the political situation in Sri Lanka for use as part of his parliamentary duties,” she added.Mr Paisley accepted and apologised for not registering the two holidays within the required 28 days. He disputed, however, that he engaged in paid lobbying on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The Westminster committee on standards however supported the conclusion of Ms Stone that Mr Paisley “was in breach of the Code of Conduct by engaging in paid advocacy”.It will now be for the House of Commons to approve the committee’s penalties based on the commissioner’s inquiry.Paul Tweed solicitor, on behalf of Mr Paisley, said that his “client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received”. “While accepting the decision of the House Standards Committee, he nonetheless continues to take issue with the sensationalised report in The Daily ,” he added. “Legal proceedings are being considered. No further comment will be made until Mr Paisley has addressed the House on Thursday,” said Mr Tweed.Theresa May’s government has been dependent on the votes of the 10 DUP MPs to remain in power. The loss of one of those votes could have implications in terms of the Brexit debate.Earlier this week crucial House of Commons votes were won by Brexiteers by three votes. Were Mr Paisley out of the House of Commons for autumn votes it could have a bearing on how key Brexit issues are decided. Moreover, if the 30-day suspension is imposed then a Recall Petition could be triggered whereby Mr Paisley could lose his seat if 10 per cent of the North Antrim eligible electorate - about 7,500 people - signed a petition to have him removed as MP.Mr Paisley would be likely to recontest the seat, as is permitted, in such an eventuality.He was close to 21,000 votes ahead of his nearest challenger in the 2017 Westminster election.However, should he lose the party whip as a result of the commissioner’s finding, he may have to stand as an independent."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers. In Afghanistan, you have no shortage of really interesting issues to cover.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Is this Trump\u0026#39s pivotal moment?Social media may be behind record number of teenage deaths on railway, says British Transport PoliceCathedral in row with heritage campaigners over plans to install CCTV cameras to stop crimeThai cave rescue: Boys and football coach tried to dig their way out and will be ordained as monks in er tributeIs it safe to visit Majorca after the tsunami?

Currently Japanese car makers have 16 research and development centres, and 14 factories, inside the EU employing 34,000 people directly and supporting another 127,000 jobs.But the car companies’ operations across national borders within the bloc could be hampered by Brexit, another expert said.World news in picturesPresident Barack Obama delivers the 16th Nelson Mandela annual lecture, marking the centenary of the anti-apartheid leader\u0027s birth, in Johannesburg, South AfricaFrench supporters celebrate on the Champs Elysees their team\u0027s victory after the World Cup 2018 final between France and CroatiaHugo Lloris lifts the trophy after France beat Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in the Luzhniki Stadium in RussiaGermany\u0027s Angelique Kerber beat seven-time champion US player Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final.

Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That’s particularly the case after yesterday’s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspincluding bonuses.”But some analysts thought that an August hike could still go ahead given firmer output data from the ONS since the first quarter’s GDP slump, which prevented a May rate hike.“We think the Committee still will press ahead and raise rates next month, given the rebound in the activity data. But the probability likely is lower than the 75 per cent\u0026nbspchance currently price-in by investors, and markets should be alert for another unscheduled intervention by the Governor,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.The ONS reported that there was upward pressure on the inflation rate from transport, reflecting higher oil prices. But this was offset by less pressure from food and drink, clothing and footwear and computer games.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, declined to 1.9 per cent, down from 2.1 per cent previously. Analysts had expected this to rise to 2.2 per cent.Separately, the ONS reported that factory gate prices were also lower than expected, rising by 3.1 per cent in June, versus expectations of a 3.2 per cent rise, although this was up from 3 per cent in May.Meanwhile, UK house price growth slowed to 3 per cent in May, down from 3.5 per cent in April.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Previous artists to have recorded the theme include Adele, Sam Smith, Madonna, Nancy Sinatra and Shirley Bassey.Referring to the band\u0027s recent video, he said: Because we had Judy Dench who was M, and Ben Whishaw who was Q, we thought it would be us. I thought they\u0027d ask us to do the theme tune but I think Dua Lipa is doing it.As the Radio 5 host did a double take and tried to follow-up on Goldsworthy\u0027s comment, Turkman appeared to try and distract him by revealing his favourite Ben Whishaw\u0026nbspfilm (Perfume).\u0026nbspOlly Alexander leads Years \u0026amp Years\u0027 transcendent new album Palo SantoPaul Simon at BST Hyde Park: One of the all-time great showsAm I not supposed to say that?

Born in\u0026nbspBrieg, Prussia (now Poland), he trained on piano, cello, organ and percussion.As a youth he was forced to play in\u0026nbspVolkssturm, an army band established by the Nazis in late 1944,\u0026nbspbtut\u0026nbspan inoperable injury to his hand at the age of 16 meant he had permanent tendon problems.The injury forced him to move away from playing instruments and into conducting, and was also why he never used a baton. From the\u0026nbspKimsche\u0026nbspOper\u0026nbspto Dresden Philharmonic, he led numerous orchestras and opera companies throughout the newly formed post-war East Germany.Most notably in his time in Europe, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspbecame leader of the Leipzig\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0026nbspin 1970, one of the continent\u0027s most prestigious orchestras, and held the position for 26 years. Such was his influence from powerful conducting and musicianship, he convinced East German Chancellor Eric Honecker to rebuild the\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0027 concert hall.His force of will also allowed him to overcome the challenges of the era and take the orchestra on international tours. But it was in 1989 that arguably his greatest moment would come. Political upheaval was in the air as the Soviet Union collapsed, and as thousands of Leipzig residents took to the streets to protest, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspwould take on a stunning public role.On 9 October he invited the masses into his orchestra\u0027s concert hall and held what was likely the first public debate East Germany had known. His cultural status had afforded Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspa measure of soft power, but this was different. This was quite a moment for a man who had never been a member of East Germany\u0027s ruling Communist party.“No one knew what would happen, and I had only some minutes to decide .... But I also knew that if I didn\u0027t do something I would regret it for the rest of my life,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin 1994.32101 Studio for Electronic MusicGoogle Doodle

He remained as music director from 1991 to 2002, while holding the\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0026nbspjob simultaneously until 1996. While he was not the most charismatic or flamboyant person at the podium, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspbecome known for improving an orchestra that had gained a reputation for not being able to hit its previous heights.Leaving the\u0026nbspNYP\u0026nbspin 2002 was not his decision, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbsplater said, but he became the orchestra\u0027s first music director emeritus. He would also work as the principal conductor for the London Philharmonic from 2000 to 2007 and as the music director for the National Orchestra of France from 2002 to 2008.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just a few hours to go until tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island.\u0026nbspIn case you missed it, Charlie and Ellie are the latest islanders to be kicked out, to the disappointment of...well nobody really.Somewhat impressively, Georgia has managed to single handedly\u0026nbspsplit the internet in two. Like Barack Obama looking through a window at some children, she has broken Twitter.\u0026nbspLet\u0027s break the warring factions down. On one side we have Team Georgia, and the other we have...well, Team Anti-Georgia.\u0026nbspTAG are judging Georgia for deciding to breakup with Sam and stay in the villa (therefore still in with a shot at the £50k, even though we know that money is obviously Dani Dyer\u0027s). They think she should\u0027ve left the villa in a display of undying love for Sam. TG, however, are rallying online to her defence, saying that Georgia in fact wanted to leave in a move of dignity, and it was actually Sam who convinced her. TG also say\u0026nbspshe has been a victim of harsh editing (remember Samira, anybody?).\u0026nbspSo which team are you on?Four new Islanders entered the villa last night. First up we have 23-year-old Stephanie Lam, who I must admit made so little impact I can\u0027t remember anything else about her.Our last two new contestants are Paul Knops (who was, fun fact, in Britney\u0027s\u0026nbspMake Me video, so he is obviously now our favourite) and DJ and model Josh Mair.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think I realised quite how many DJs and models there are in the world until I watched\u0026nbspLove Island.Apparently s*** is going to hit the fan for Jack and Laura tonight which is not good news. Mainly because I don\u0027t know how much longer I can watch that man pretend he cares about any of this.With £ signs in their eyes, Georgia and Sam made the brave decision to end their blossoming relationship in the pursuit of cash love.\u0026nbspSam has already had a successful date with new contestant Laura, but will Georgia have her head turned tonight?It seems ITV2 appears some viewers\u0026nbspare having streaming issues. Although unconfirmed, several people have reported issues with accessing the channel on ITV Player. We\u0027ll let you know if there are any updates on this.Rumour has it that Dr Alex might be tempted by one of the new women tonight. You are finally settled down Dr Alex, don\u0027t ruin it when the end is so tantalizingly near!Here we go! Let\u0027s begin tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island...Oh so \u0027loyal\u0027 Georgia has brought over two women over to the firepit for a heart to heart chat.Laura says if it was her and Jack, she would have left. Brutal Laura, brutal.And here comes the drama. Laura says if she was in Georgia\u0027s position, she would have left the villa in a show of love for Jack. He, however, has other ideas (mainly £50k) and secretly said he would stay.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn usual Laura style, she is absolutely furious and has stormed off from the firepit of doom.Poor old Sam is regretting his decision already, saying he can\u0027t talk to the new girls (is that code for I don\u0027t fancy any of them?)Jack is backtracking on everything he said, pleading with ever-furious Laura that he was only comforting Sam. Yeah right mate, you\u0027d drop Laura like a hot cake if the opportunity arose.Now we have new boy Josh who says my type is nice eyes, nice teeth and all the right curves.\u0026nbspI think I was just sick in my mouth new Josh.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Now it looks odds-on that the MPC will hold fire yet again. That’s particularly the case after yesterday’s wage growth data emerged weaker than expected at 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspincluding bonuses.”But some analysts thought that an August hike could still go ahead given firmer output data from the ONS since the first quarter’s GDP slump, which prevented a May rate hike.“We think the Committee still will press ahead and raise rates next month, given the rebound in the activity data. But the probability likely is lower than the 75 per cent\u0026nbspchance currently price-in by investors, and markets should be alert for another unscheduled intervention by the Governor,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.The ONS reported that there was upward pressure on the inflation rate from transport, reflecting higher oil prices. But this was offset by less pressure from food and drink, clothing and footwear and computer games.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, declined to 1.9 per cent, down from 2.1 per cent previously. Analysts had expected this to rise to 2.2 per cent.Separately, the ONS reported that factory gate prices were also lower than expected, rising by 3.1 per cent in June, versus expectations of a 3.2 per cent rise, although this was up from 3 per cent in May.Meanwhile, UK house price growth slowed to 3 per cent in May, down from 3.5 per cent in April.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many scientists have argued that while the name is eye-catching, it lacks the geological evidence to back it up.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent earlier this year that the Netherlands customs authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of the early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a no deal.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol are also planning significant physical changes to accommodate extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a no deal, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its own Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that table had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Theresa May has repeatedly said that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off the economic cliff-edge if she does not get her way in talks.Asked about whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister said: “I think that all Governments including the United Kingdom government have to plan for all contingencies.”He added: “We’ll be making more public comment about our no deal preparations over the weeks to come and Dominic Raab will be leading on that. There is a lot of work that’s been going on behind the scenes”.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay.

I’ve cried myself to sleep so many times,” says her mum Natalie Cooch, 37, from Stafford.Without somewhere to permanently rest her head, Heather lacks a bedtime routine and is regularly tired and irritable in the mornings.Often sleep deprived, she finds it hard to concentrate throughout the day, which has a detrimental effect on her education.“It’s affecting her terribly,” Natalie explains. “She’s really tired and moody in the mornings.She’s getting into a routine of staying awake for far too long. Her concentration during the day just isn’t what it should be.”Heather and her parents have lived in a string of tiny properties after Natalie’s mother passed away in 2011, forcing Heather and her parents to leave the home they had all shared together.Natalie runs a small business renting out gypsy-style carts and caravans but suffers with anxiety and depression and Heathers dad has a degenerative back problem that prevents him from working.Since 2011, theyve lived in a series of tiny flats and even a house boat.And with next to no money and minimal space, Heather’s parents have been unable to provide their daughter with the bed she desperately needs.“She’s at an age now where she needs her space and wants her own bed. I’m upset that we haven’t been able to provide that for her.Sadly, Heathers isn’t an isolated case.More children are living in relative poverty than at any other time in the past 10 years, with 4.1million children across the UK living below the breadline.Like thousands of other families in crisis, Heather’s parents have turned to Buttle UK, a grant-giving charity that is a lifeline to thousands of families and young people in need.Over the past five years, Dreams Beds has provided charity Buttle UK with nearly 10,000 children’s beds to donate to those families in desperate need.Aiming to help even more children, The Sun joined forces with Dreams Beds to launch the Beds for Kids campaign.This means for every bed or mattress bought at Dreams Beds, one will be donated to Buttle UKs Chances for Children campaign.Our initiative is helping 3,000 children in need of a good night’s sleep - children just like Heather.Heather and her family have moved into a two-bedroom council house in Hilderstone, Stafford, so we sent the Dreams Beds delivery lorry out out on a very special delivery for the 11-year-old.After hearing that a bed of her very own was finally on the way after seven long years, Heather told The Sun: “I’m looking forward to having my own room and sleeping in a clean, comfy bed. I haven’t had a bed in so long.“I can have my friends round and have sleepovers all the time.”When the doorbell rang, Heather rushed to welcome the delivery drivers. She was smiling from ear-to-ear as she showed them up to her new room.Once it had been assembled, mum Natalie helped her make the bed - and with her new pink pillows nicely plumped, Heather dived straight in.I love it and I’m never getting out,” she said.The Sun would like to thank all our amazing readers for supporting the Beds for Kids campaign so far. THERE are 400,000 children in the UK who do not have a bed. Without somewhere to rest their head, bedtime routines become difficult, stress levels rise and getting a good night’s sleep is almost impossible.Below are three ways you can support our Beds for Kids campaign.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Buttle UKs Chances for Children campaign.Simply take the voucher below into any Dreams Beds store when you buy a bed or mattress and you will be making a big difference to a child’s life.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.It tells the story of Sleepy Simon’s quest for a bed to sleep in.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up. Who do they think they are kidding — us or themselves? “There are none so blind as those who will not see.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

Guess why.On so-called “low-level” crime, some forces have shamefully just surrendered.WHY was France’s President Macron buddying up to Putin at the World Cup final?We don’t begrudge him his moment of glory, of course. His team deservedly won. But Putin’s regime is guilty of ­heinous crimes, from the Salisbury poisonings to the downing of a jumbo jet.Four months ago France expelled four Russian diplomats. Was it just a stunt?This wasn’t a summit for world peace, as Donald Trump’s was yesterday. It was a football jolly, sealing a month-long PR triumph for the Kremlin.Macron should have watched from Paris.TAKING back control of our borders won’t mean a thing if we fail to exercise it.It is worrying that immigration has gone up again thanks to a 13-year high in those arriving from outside the EU — which the Government CAN limit.For years the totals have been too great for our communities to cope with. Where are the new homes, hospitals or transport for the 280,000 net migrants in 2017?We’re all for immigration to benefit our economy. But the numbers are nowhere near manageable.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it said the DWP should provide a figure for the total amount claimants have missed out on, along with an explanation of how it will provide “appropriate remedies”.The committee said: “There is clearly much more to be done to right this wrong. We encourage the department to act swiftly, decisively and comprehensively to address the harm caused by this mistake and, more broadly, to give much greater priority to correcting benefit underpayments to vulnerable people.”Those affected were people whose ability to work is affected by disability or illness, who were transferred from the old incapacity benefit on to ESA from 2011 onwards. Some 70,000 ended up being underpaid for years, losing an average of £5,000, found the report. Of these, more than 20,000 of those most in need are owed around £11,500 each and some as much as £20,000.The report found that the “unacceptable and entirely avoidable” situation came about because of “multiple failures” by the DWP. The department failed to listen to staff, claimants or experts when they warned that things were going wrong and failed to scrutinise its own processes properly or to ensure that they reflected the legislation, said the committee.And a “culture of indifference” at the department meant it took more than six years to take action, even though it was “painfully obvious” that a significant number of claimants were being underpaid.“Thousands of people have not received money essential for living costs because of Government’s blinkered and wholly inept handling of ESA,” said Ms Hillier.“The department simply didn’t listen to what claimants, experts, support organisations and its own staff were saying. Its sluggishness in correcting underpayments, years after it accepted responsibility for the error, points to weaknesses at the highest levels of management. Indifference has no place in the delivery of vital public services. It must be rooted out wherever it is found.“The department needs to explain what it is doing to improve both its management culture and its ability to gather and act promptly on critical intelligence.“It must also set out how it will more quickly address the £1.7 billion of underpayments claimants miss out on each year.”A DWP spokesman said: “We take the issue of underpayments very seriously and have actively taken steps to put this right as quickly as possible, to ensure people get the support they are entitled to. We have recruited 400 extra staff and have already started making payments - over £40 million so far. We have continued to provide regular updates to both the PAC and the House in regards to the progress of these repayments, and will continue in this stead.”In a separate development, the chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee wrote to employment minister Alok Sharma to raise concerns over benefit sanctions data supplied by the DWP.Frank Field said that the department’s published data “consistently understate” the sanctions applied to claimants by removing those who have successfully appealed against decisions.And he queried the decision to sanction 1,108 Universal Credit claimants in February alone despite them being judged medically unfit to work or look for work.“What is the point of applying sanctions to people who cannot work and are not expected to look for jobs?” asked Mr Field. Benefit sanctions are the only major welfare reform this decade to have never been evaluated, and the picture DWP paints of the policy doesn’t match the troubling stories we’ve heard.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Former Brexit Secretary resigned over May\u0027s Chequers deal which planned to keep the UK closely linked to the EU.  Today he called for plans his department had worked on for a free trade deal to be published. He said: The Department for Exiting the European Union carried out a study of all of the previous free trade deals that the European Union has done in order to create a draft free trade deal which was based solely on European precedent.  The department was, until I left at least, was working on a legal text of such a draft treaty as one fall back option in the current negotiation. Would she agree to publish that text when it\u0027s complete? Theresa May thanked Davis for his work at the Department.  But the Prime Minister said she did not want a plan for the UK which was an amalgam of previous deals. Instead she repeated her commitment to getting a bespoke trade deal for the UK.   Earlier in the PMQs session Theresa May delivered a stinging slap down to a Leave-supporting MP who asked at what point it was decided Brexit means Remain.  MPs booed the question and Mrs May delivered a withering reply. She told Andrea Jenkyns: At absolutely no point because Brexit continues to mean Brexit. I know that she wants us to talk about the positives of Brexit and I agree with her we should be talking about the positive future for this country. I understand she\u0027s also criticised me for finding a solution that is workable I have to say that I disagree with her on that.  I think what we need is a solution that is going to work for the United Kingdom, ensure we leave the European Union and embrace that bright future we all agree on.

He admitted there was “zero trust, at best” between “victims” and the Government following the disaster in which 72 people were killed.

And there is precedent - in times of crisis, such as financial crash or war, Britain has had Grand Coalitions of all political parties who come together in the national interest. We did it in the First World War and the Second. We also did it during the Depression, when financial crisis meant the Labour government couldn\u0027t agree what to do, the extremes of Left and Right were agitating, and King George V stepped in to demand a national government instead.  So Anna Soubry wasn\u0027t talking entirely out of her bum when she said: Jacob Rees-Mogg is running the country... This really should concern everybody about the state of democracy... I think we need a government of national unity.  The current government is split over Brexit, the Prime Minister is having a limb removed by backbenchers every day, and while they scrap over the most important thing to affect our country in a generation we are heading towards a Brexit deadline that will likely have the same impact as an angle grinder on a snoozing face.  If we crash out without a deal, farm subsidies stop at midnight. Borders close, tariffs kick in, the City can\u0027t do business and Northern Ireland will have the peacekeeping lights turned off.  Save us, Queenie! Step in and tell these turds to put politics aside and act in the national interest.  Which is a lovely idea, until you realise who\u0027d be running it. Winston Churchill is not available, which leaves two choices.  The first is that some of the current crop form a government. The PM would need to be a party leader, which means Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable, Ian Blackford for the People\u0027s Republic of Scotland or Nigel Dodds of the Northern Ireland Wingnuts.  Traditionally they lead a Cabinet mixed of all parties, but balanced politically slightly in the other direction, for fairness. So Comrade Corbyn would need to lead a majority Tory cabinet, St Theresa would be in charge of a mostly-Labour front bench, and Grandad Cable would pirouette at the despatch box while in charge of a government that doesn\u0027t watch Strictly Come Dancing.  Let\u0027s not think what the cabinets of Dodds or Blackford would be like. There\u0027d be blood on the shagpile either way. The Queen could nominate a non-leader as PM, but seeing as no-one has yet found a genius-level unicorn it\u0027s unlikely they\u0027d get cross-party support, which means back to square one. There is a second option. Which would be to appoint those politicians who did the jobs for longest, and thus have the most experience. Whatever your politics, it would be hard to argue that knowing what you\u0027re doing is a luxury unnecessary to untangling Brexit.  Of course, you cannot reanimate our first and longest-serving PM Robert Walpole, who was in charge from 1721 to 1742 and even doubled up as Chancellor for some of it. You\u0027ve got to choose the person who was PM for longest and is still alive.   There are many people who hanker after a return to the optimism of 1997, not least Tony Blair. And about as many who hanker after stringing him up for war in Iraq, which is a good chunk of the current Labour Party.  But then who is our longest-serving and surviving Chancellor, to be alongside him? Ah.   I liked Gordon Brown. He was sincere and intelligent, which always helps, and bailing out the banks in 2008 saved the UK from disaster. But the Tories can\u0027t see him without squealing borrowing! like little piggies who have forgotten George Osborne.  And we all know how Blair and Brown got on when they were in Downing Street before. They\u0027re still patching up the plaster.  Anyway. Longest serving foreign secretary? Jack Straw, which would be torture in more ways than one. Home secretary? Theresa, who at least comes with her own \u0027go home\u0027 van we could bundle her into.  And health of course is important. The NHS is the closest we come to having a national religion these days, and we need someone that can be trusted not to cock it up.  Ah, bugger.    In short, all the obvious candidates for a government of national unity are either people who are already clearly incompetent, or the New Labour government of 1997.  And it\u0027s doubtful that even Blair at his most messianic, even Brown with the most clunking of fists, could find a way to impose border checks in a place where you\u0027re not allowed a border, trade with a union of 27 nations without following a single one of its rules, keep farm payments without contributions, stop Kent becoming a lorry park, save the car industry, and then find a way for the City to do financial deals without complying with the EU, all in the space of eight months.  On the plus side, they\u0027d make Mogg look like the fusty out-of-touch imagineer he is. And the 1930s coalitions led to Ramsay MacDonald, arguably one of the country\u0027s greatest Prime Ministers, being expelled from the Labour Party, disowned by the unions, and subsequently winning the biggest landslide in British history - against the official Labour candidate.  If we had a MacDonald, perhaps we could do it. But we don\u0027t.  But there is, in typical Blair style, a third way.  And that is to cancel Brexit. Not because it means ignoring the will of the people, and not because democracy is dead. But because democracy got buggered.  The referendum was invalid, because only one of the two choices the people were presented with was possible. Remaining was always an option, but Leave was not. The ballot paper, to be valid, should have asked us to choose between \u0027Remain\u0027 and \u0027Leave the EU, Northern Ireland, and thereby dissolve the United Kingdom\u0027. Never mind all the add-ons about single markets and customs unions - to Leave meant a province of 1.8million British citizens was told to go hang, and it should have said so.  The will of the people is also changing. Leavers have started to see that belief is not enough, and dreaming doesn\u0027t get you financial passporting rights. Reality is biting, and if the will of the people changes then so must government policy, whatever Theresa says.     There are allegations democracy was interfered with using illegally-harvested data, that the Russians were tinkering with it and election laws were broken. There\u0027s enough evidence to say the vote was unsafe.  And in the absence of anyone capable of carrying it out, what choice is there? Politicians voting against their own constituents, voting with their constituents even when they know it\u0027s wrong, being sent home early and haggling over leadership, while the whole nation is chained to a clown car pointed at the English Channel and picking up speed. Brexit wasn\u0027t an option. Brexit won\u0027t work. Brexit will hurt us all, and it will hurt the people who voted for it the most. So come on, Queenie. Do your bit. Point out the iceberg and steer us around it - tell Theresa the United Kingdom is not up for negotiation, and the whole country will back you. There simply is no other solution.

First and foremost let me make clear that I was elected to put the people of Barrow and Furness first, no matter how difficult or controversial. I have promised to fight for local jobs, promote a credible alternative government, protect the shipyard and ensure the safety of my constituents through strong defence and national security. I now believe more strongly than ever that you have made the Labour Party unfit to deliver those objectives and would pose a clear risk to UK national security as prime minister.  The party for which I have campaigned since I was a boy is no longer the broad church it has always historically been. Anti-Semitism is being tolerated and Labour has been taken over at nearly every level by the hard left, far beyond the dominance they achieved at the height of 1980s militancy.   For the full story on John Woodcock\u0027s resignation click here.    Suspended MP John Woodcock resigns from Labour Party branding Jeremy Corbyn a \u0027clear risk to national security\u0027   There is little chance of returning the Labour party to the inclusive, mainstream electoral force my constituents desperately need. In these circumstances, I can no longer justify engaging in a rigged process to be re-admitted to it. As you know, Labour’s new general secretary, who has previously said she wanted to ‘ditch Blairites’, overturned a previous ruling of a party disciplinary panel and suspended me after someone placed confidential details of my disciplinary case in two Sunday newspapers. This followed a newspaper report that the Labour leadership was looking for a reason to suspend me because of my opposition to your leadership. Emails that have since been released to me through data laws reveal that senior party figures have long been determined to prevent me re-standing as a Labour candidate because of my views on your leadership. It was noted in one such email that suspending me for a reason unrelated to those views would enable me to be barred from re-selection without risking legal challenge. It is not credible to expect a fair hearing in these circumstances. I strongly deny the charge made against me but am committed to the complaint being thoroughly and fairly investigated. I will now seek to refer myself to an independent process so the case can be properly heard. I hope you will listen to the growing calls from the Labour Too campaign and others to do the same for all cases.

William ‘Billy’ Isaac, originally from Denton, died in Ireland aged 45 in 2013 - and police believe thugs are specifically targeting his grave. Isaac, who had a reputation as an underworld hardman, was buried at Blackley Cemetery in north Manchester. Police say the motive for his grave being disturbed is unclear, adding that it has caused his family a great deal of anguish.  According to The Sun , grave robbers were hoping Isaac was buried with valuable jewellery.  But his family has stressed he wasn’t buried with any items of monetary value.  A friend of Ricky Hatton and legendary Manchester boxing trainer Bob Shannon, Isaac had faced several criminal trials in his lifetime, the Manchester Evening News reports.   He was acquitted of the murder of a woman in Reddish, Stockport, in 1995, but had convictions for serious assaults and possession of live ammunition. Police investigating the latest incident at the cemetery on Victoria Avenue said his remains have now been exhumed and the whole burial plot has been secured. Officers were called to the plot on Wednesday, June 27 then again on Wednesday, July 4. Detectives are appealing for witnesses or anyone with any information to get in touch.  Detective Inspector Claire Moss said: “Police enquiries are ongoing, but we believe that this incident was targeted to this specific plot. “This is a despicable act, and it has caused the family an enormous amount of anguish and grief in finding out that their loved one’s grave has twice been disturbed in what is meant to be a place of rest. “The motivation for this incident is unclear at this stage of the investigation, but the family want to make it known that their loved one was not buried with any items of monetary value. “We will do everything we can to find out who is responsible for this, and I would appeal to any members of the public who know anything to please get in touch with police.”  In 2010 Isaac was also found not guilty of threatening to kill a businessman in the north east after claims of a \u0026pound2.5m ‘debt’. He had moved to Ireland some time after 2007 following his release from a three-year prison sentence and lived in a secluded mansion in Durrus, West Cork, which was known by locals as ‘Ratsville’ due to rodent designs on its gates and fences.

This summer we’ve had the longest dry spell for 40 years, with baking heat and no rain for much of the country. As we Brits have had to make the difficult transition from moaning about the cold to moaning about the heat, the unremitting sunshine has not come without its difficulties. As we sit in pub gardens and enjoy the sun, the powers that be have been fretting about water supplies. A hosepipe ban has been announced for North West England as water levels run low, and there are fears it could be widely extended. So, here are some top tips for saving water. 1. Get shower smart An aerating shower head adds air to the water stream, using less water while still feeling as powerful as a traditional shower. This can halve water use. Shower together to use even less water.  2. Turn off taps You save six litres of water per minute by turning off the tap while cleaning your teeth. Fix leaky taps to stop pouring 60 litres of water down the drain each week. 3. Stockpile dirty washing Doing one full machine of clothes uses less water than two half loads. It also cuts your electricity bill. 4. Buy an efficient toilet Modern dual flush toilets use six litres of water each time (four on the reduced function). It’s 13 litres for a traditional single flush loo. Alternatively, you can get a water saving bag for your old toilet. 5. Reuse water You could empty the paddling pool on to your lawn and flowerbeds. But don’t pour salt water on plants after cooking – because salt is a plant killer.  6. Eat less meat and dairy Rearing livestock is incredibly water intensive. Steaming vegetables uses less water than boiling them. 7. Water outdoor plants first or last thing Do the watering early in the morning or at the end of the day when it is cooler, to prevent the water immediately evaporating in the heat. Water the soil so the liquid goes straight to the roots. Only water the garden when required. Put a spade’s blade all the way into the soil – if the earth is damp at this depth it may not need watering as there is enough moisture.

Yet instead of walking out on Anastasia \u0026shyPomiateeva, the 44-year-old astonishingly stood by his partner of nine years. But even worse was to come for Gary when dad Stephen suffocated his 62-year-old wife Anne after a blazing row over the secret fling. After the former UKIP councillor was today found guilty of murder, his son spoke about how the tangled web of infidelity, lies and tragedy ended with him and Anastasia forming a stronger bond than they had before.  Gary, who has disowned his scheming dad, said of the affair: “When I found out it was \u0026shyheartbreaking. I just couldn’t believe the man I absolutely \u0026shyidolised and worshipped had done something like that to me. “But me and Anastasia just love each other so much that if anything this has brought us closer together. We will be together for the rest of our lives, until we are old and grey. We have all done things in our lives we are not proud of. “At the end of the day we had already been through so much together.  “If this doesn’t break us we can overcome anything together. I haven’t got an old man any more for obvious reasons. “When my mum died I just felt numb. I had not only lost my mum but also my father as well, he was my best friend. “I would have done anything for him, it’s a huge betrayal.” Anastasia, who claimed Searle pursued her relentlessly until she gave in to his sordid advances, added: “I was relieved when it came out. I felt so ashamed and guilty. I want us to rebuild now the trial is over. Time is a healer.” The couple decided to speak out after being approached by the Daily Mirror.  Former Royal Marine Searle met Anastasia in 2005 when they worked together at Solar Bowl bowling alley where he was manager. In 2009 she began a relationship with Gary, after he also got a job there. The couple had three children and Anastasia was treated as a daughter-in-law by Searle and Anne. In March last year Searle invited her for coffee at his UKIP office in the council building at Ipswich, Suffolk. During the visit he told her he had not had sex for six years and asked if she would like to “make him happy”. Anastasia, who was born in Britain but has a Russian father, refused and left. But dad-of-three Searle continued harassing her – using bodybuilding pictures from his youth – and in April she “relented”.  Anastasia said: “When he approached me I was shocked and surprised. But at the time I was very vulnerable because my nan was really unwell in hospital. “I had always been \u0026shyintimidated by him as he’s very powerful, controlling and manipulative. “I was a prat to give in but he took advantage of my vulnerability and I felt sorry for him.” The fling began when Anastasia visited Searle at his family home in Stowmarket. She said he gave her the nickname SBG – short for Steve’s Beautiful Girl. The lovers exchanged explicit pictures and texts. Anastasia added: “Whenever I tried to break it off he said that he needed me. I felt dirty, I always had to have a shower straight after meeting him.”  The two-month affair ended last June when suspicious Anne guessed her husband’s phone PIN was 4545 – after he served in 45 Commando – and spotted the exchanges. She discovered they were trying to arrange a hotel meeting and confronted Searle. Giving evidence at Ipswich crown court during his trial, he said: “I was a stupid old sod and made a massive mistake. “I totally admitted everything. She [Anne] was extremely upset, that goes without saying.” Anastasia confessed everything to Gary. She said: “I wanted him to know the truth, I wanted him to know everything.”  The court heard that the messy affair ripped the Searle family apart. Gary, who has two brothers, Stephen Jr, 29, and 41-year-old \u0026shyChristopher, broke off contact with his dad. But despite the turmoil he caused, \u0026shydetermined Searle continued trying to contact Anastasia, even “stalking her” and following her to \u0026shysupermarkets and baby groups. She also found out he had been obsessed with her for years, even compiling a sick photo collection on his computer. Anastasia said: “He had pictures of me from before I met Gary stored on his computer. “He had downloaded them from Facebook and superimposed my head on to the bodies of porn stars. I was scared of him. Me and Gary changed our numbers to stop him contacting us.”  The court heard Searle’s fling with Anastasia led to tragedy on December 30 last year, when Searle had the murderous row with Anne. After smothering his wife of 45 years, he phoned police and told them: “I’ve just killed my wife.” He claimed he strangled sushi factory worker Anne in self-defence after she attacked him with a steak knife at their \u0026pound320,000 home. But jurors rejected his concocted story and took just three and a half hours to convict him of murdering her with a choke hold he learned during military training. Searle, recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, held his head in his hands following the verdict. He had asked to attend today’s sentencing hearing via videolink from HMP Norwich, complaining about the “unpleasant” prison van journey. But the judge insisted he be in court. Searle, who had a nine-year military career, will be jailed for life on Wednesday at Ipswich.

Louise Young, 29, began suffering from severe skin problems while she was pregnant with her fourth child in 2015.  First blaming her ‘break outs’ on her hormones, Louise was shocked when her skin continued to worsen after her daughter, Angel, two, was born and she was diagnosed with severe cystic acne. Over the past three years Louise tried everything to help her skin from different antibiotics, face washes and even resorted in using her own breast milk as a ‘facemask’ after a midwife recommended it. But now, Louise is sharing her message of how a \u0026pound3 ‘miracle’ acne cream she bought on eBay, TCM Scar and Acne Mark Removal Gel Ointment, has transformed her skin in order to raise awareness to others in a similar situation.  Louise, from Stirling, Scotland, said: “My skin first broke out when I was pregnant with my fourth child but it just continued to get worse even after I’d given birth. “I thought that when my daughter was born it would go away, but it continued to get worse and ruined my self-confidence. “There was a point where I didn’t leave the house for eight weeks because I couldn’t bear to let anyone look at my skin, and nothing I did would help make it better. “I felt as though I had tried everything to sort my skin out – I even put my own breastmilk on my face as I was recommended to from my midwife, but that didn’t work. “As soon as I found this cream my life changed and within two weeks my scarring started to clear up.” After her daughter was born, Louise, a stay-at-home mum, hoped that her skin would return to normal, but it continued to worsen until June this year.

Christopher Lythgoe, 32, was arrested by police investigating a plot to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper and a female police officer. It came just over a year after fellow Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death in her constituency by neo-Nazi Thomas Mair. The plan - which the judge said Lythgoe did nothing to stop or discourage - was foiled by a whistle-blower, Robbie Mullen.  Mr Mullen leaked details of a meeting at the Friar Penketh pub in Warrington, Cheshire, to campaigner group Hope Not Hate last July. Jack Renshaw has pleaded guilty to preparing to engage in an act of terrorism in relation to the plot and threatening a police officer. The 23-year-old, from Lancashire, has also been convicted of stirring up racial hatred in speeches in 2016, it can now be reported. Lythgoe, from Warrington, was charged with being a member of National Action after it was banned by the Home Secretary over its support for the murder of Mrs Cox in Birstall, West Yorkshire. He was also accused of encouraging the murder of West Lancashire MP Ms Cooper by telling Renshaw not to f*** it up during the meeting on July 1. Today, a jury at London\u0027s Old Bailey found him guilty of membership of National Action but not guilty of encouraging Renshaw.  The verdicts followed 20 hours of deliberations. Prominent member Matthew Hankinson, 24, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, was also found guilty of belonging to National Action. He was locked up for six years. The jury acquitted Garron Helm, 24, of Seaforth, Merseyside, of the same charge. Mr Justice Jay described National Action as having a truly evil and dystopian vision of waging a race war. Without Lythgoe\u0027s obsessive determination to keep it going, it would have withered and died on the vine. While numbers were too small to achieve its aims, there was a real risk it could have inspired acts of terror by its perverted ideology, the judge said.

Peter Lee - who said he “has given everything” to the company - downed tools at Arundel station in West Sussex in January. He insisted he was entitled to 20 minutes rest as his shift was more than six hours. But Network Rail said Peter had closed a signal box “at the height of the weekday rush hour” and could have put people at risk. The 60-year-old - who has worked for the network for 44 years - was dismissed for gross misconduct in May for “exercising his rights” as an employee. Now rail unions are balloting to strike in a bid to get Peter’s job back at the station used by under fire Southern Rail services. The Working Time Regulations Act 1998 states anyone working more than six hours at a time is entitled to a 20-minute rest break.  Peter won a grievance case in 2015 that gave the signalmen at the station the right to those breaks. But when he arrived at work on Monday, January 8, the roster had been changed and there was no-one to cover his break. He told his line manager he would be taking the break, insisting it was his legal right. Peter said: “I told my manager I would be taking the break, giving him four days’ notice. “I also found three people who could cover the break but they refused to use them. “On Thursday, I started the process of closing down the signal box - it takes 30 minutes - and then two managers arrived at the station and told me to go home.  “I never got the chance to close the signal box as the managers approached me to suspend me before I could. “I would never put anyone travelling or working on the railway in any danger. “Why couldn’t one of them cover it?” He was suspended with full pay until May 18, when he was dismissed for gross misconduct. Peter said: “I started here as a box boy when I was 16 - it’s my whole life, and it’s completely shattered. “I’m gutted. “I have given them 44 years of my life, and now that’s it - I’m done. “They have taken everything from me.” Peter, from Littlehampton, had been fighting for the breaks for eight years.  He said: “We used ergonomic studies to win our grievance and it was proven we need these breaks. “Even then it was only given to us Monday to Saturday, early and lates, not Sundays or nights. “I continued to campaign against that because we have a right to breaks for shifts over six hours. “I was working 12-hour Sundays with no break. “The signaller at Arundel is now working without any breaks because the station is short-staffed. “This needs exposing. “On top of all this Network Rail is still fighting tooth and nail against allowing us to have breaks.” Chris Rodway, secretary for the Sussex Coast branch of RMT, believes what happened to Peter is “clearly vindictive” and that there are safety issues to consider. Chris said: “He’s been arguing this case for eight years. “The working time directive states that they are entitled to a meal break. “What happened is clearly vindictive- one of the managers who came along that day was capable of taking over the box but instead used draconian measures against him for exercising his legal rights.

The \u0027yellow warning\u0027 for Friday saying there is also a chance of homes and businesses flooding suddenly at a rapid rate. People could see power cuts where lightening strikes may occur. There is also the potential of transport chaos with road closures and delays possible. A weather map shows the affected area focused mainly on the South East of England, including London. However, the Met Office also suggests that it touches East Midlands, East of England, and South West of England.  Most places will be dry but there is the potential for slow-moving thundery downpours in places, The Met Office says. There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater. Where flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train, bus and tube services, particularly during the evening rush hour. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions with the possibility of road closures. There is a slight chance that power cuts could occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost.  Most parts of the Home Counties could see up to 30mm of rain in just an hour, which raises the possibility of some flash flooding. The weather warning is in place between 2pm and 11.59pm on Friday, July 20. It comes as sun worshippers have enjoyed weeks of scorching weather, with temperatures hitting 31.5C on Monday during the longest heatwave for 42 years. It will start to feel very warm and humid again by the weekend with showers in the north and plenty of sunshine in the south.

Lori Alexander has shared her views in a controversial post, claiming women shouldn\u0027t go to university, should remain a virgin and should never, ever gets tattoos. Unsurprisingly her message hasn\u0027t gone down well, and many people believe her views are actually extremely un-Christian and will be harmful to young women.  She shared her advice on her blog The Transformed Wife , which aims to advise younger people on marriage, raising children and homemaking.  She writes: Do you know how much more attractive debt-free virgins (without tattoos) are to young men?  Unfortunately, there are so few of these types of young women anymore because of the high costs of college (debt) and sexual promiscuity even within those in the church. She goes on to say young women should carefully consider whether or not they go to college, especially if they want to be wives and mothers someday.

Keep a long-term vision of your life and how you hope it will be someday instead of acting upon all of the \u0027what ifs…?\u0027 that many will throw at you. Trust God with your life, study the Word, and take the narrow path that leads to life. Stay virgins until marriage, out of debt, and don\u0027t get tattoos!  Lori, who lives in America, has been married for 23 years, and has four children and five grandchildren.  After reading the post, many people are outraged about her ideas and the Facebook post has attracted more than 30,000 comments.  One wrote: I\u0027m so glad that I found a man who is nowhere near shallow, self-righteous, and controlling enough to believe that my past relationships, college debt, or tattoos in any way negatively impact my value as a person or spouse. What an incredibly un-Christlike attitude to perpetuate. I\u0027m truly sad for you, The Transformed Wife, and for all of the women who buy into your poisonous, twisted version of the gospel. Another commented: Why are we always telling women to change for men? Why should any woman settle for a man who is afraid of her intelligence, can’t figure out how to financially contribute, and/or thinks he gets total control over her body? This is abuse. One woman replied: Full of tattoos and 90k in school loan debt... and I have no trouble with the men... or the ladies. Another said: You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you are sending a message to young women that if only they were different, better, perfect, what “men prefer” they would be more loveable, treated with more love, respect, kindness. As a person who married at 19 and was a debt free, tattoo free, virgin, I can tell you what men prefer doesn\u0027t matter, I was the ideal bride and then endured 12 years of severe abuse, I constantly thought it was my fault, and if only there was something I could do to be better more worthy and loveable.

Walter Carr, 20, walked all night in the dark so he wouldn\u0027t miss his shift with a removals company. A police officer stopped the aspiring US marine at 4am and took him for breakfast after being impressed by his story, which soon went viral in a Facebook post. When Bellhoops CEO Luke Marklin found out, he surprised Mr Carr at work and gave him his car as a thank you.  Mr Carr, whose family\u0027s home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, became emotional and was left stunned, turning to Mr Marklin and saying Seriously? when he was handed the keys to the 2014 Ford Escape. He told AL: This was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired. I wanted to show them I got the dedication.

He was in Pelham in the early hours of Friday when a police officer stopped and approached him. The officer admired his determination and took him out for breakfast, and a colleague drove him to the home where he was due to help Jenny Lamey and her husband Chris move house.  Mum-of-two Mrs Lamey wrote a Facebook post hailing Mr Carr, and it soon went viral as praise poured in for the young man. She told how her doorbell rang at 6.30am and she was surprised by a police officer, who said he had picked up this nice kid who was supposed to help with the move. Mrs Lamey added: It was his first day on the job with this moving company (Bellhops) and he was \u0027training\u0027 today. The officer proceeded to tell us that the previous evening Walter’s car broke down and he didn’t know how he was going to get to work.  So he left Homewood at MIDNIGHT and started WALKING to Pelham on 280. He WALKED ALL NIGHT to get from Homewood to Pelham. Because he needed to get to work. For those reading this that are not local, that’s over 20 Miles. She invited Mr Carr inside and said he could have a nap, but he declined and started working immediately before his colleagues arrived.  Mrs Lamey said Mr Carr told her how he and his mum had moved to Birmingham after losing their home in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. She added: I asked him if he was tired from all that walking and he said replied that he wasn’t and that he had a 4 hour nap before he left at midnight.

Some say the edible insects may become just \u0027like sushi\u0027. They\u0027re already being ground in some places to be used in recipes for protein bars, bread, or deep fried and served in restaurants on their own. Statistics by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations show crickets have a higher protein and iron content than chicken. They also have a higher iron content and less saturated fat than meat from pigs and cows, the figures show. Radek Husek is the co-founder of Prague and London-based SENS Foods Ltd, who make cricket flour for protein bars and bread.  He told Bloomberg “crickets are the least-scary bug.”  “People are really scared to eat a whole bug, but it’s a much different story when they know that actually the bug is ground into powder and they cannot see it,” he added.  And a couple in southern Finland have opted to turn their pig farm into a climate-controlled cricket farm. Kirsi and Jouko Siikonen\u0027s ditched their 1,200 pigs in favour of the cheaper option of cricket farming a month after Finland approved the sale of edible insects in November. The insects are largely ground into an ingredient for a range of products including chocolate, bar snacks, breakfast granola and crispbread.

Bruce McArthur, 66, is accused of murdering at least eight gay men in Toronto, Canada - many of whom he may have picked up in the city\u0027s gay village or on dating apps. The alleged killer, who worked as a gardener, was caught when police arrested him at home, where they found a potential ninth victim tied to the bed. A two week search of a property in the city\u0027s Leaside area, where dad-of-two McArthur was employed as a gardener, led police to human remains buried in potted plants - including small fragments of bone and teeth.  During the search, they found remains from seven different men, reports the New York Post. Police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said: I can confirm that remains were found almost every day we were there. The city of Toronto has never seen anything like this. Forensics are now continuing to search other properties throughout Toronto where McArthur may have had access to via his job. McArthur, who advertised his services as a dominant gay man, was first brought to the attention of police in 2002, when he was arrested for an assault on a gay prostitute.  After the disappearance of Andrew Kinsman, 49, and Selim Esen, 44, in the summer of 2017, police began investigating McArthur as a suspect in early 2018, placing him on 24 hour police surveillance on January 17. Just one day after their surveillance started, McArthur was seen entering his high-storey apartment with another man. He was arrested before police began the search of the Leaside property, where remains were found on an almost daily basis. McArthur was charged with the murder of Andrew Kinsman and Selim Esen, along with eight other men.

That\u0026#8217s higher than Great Britain\u0026#8217s average of 46%.The test centre with the highest pass rate was Golspie, in the Scottish Highlands, where more than three quarters of learners were awarded their licences, while in The Pavilion, in Birmingham, less than a third were successful, making it the toughest.On December 4 last year the driving test was changed, with many observers saying the new test is tougher than the old one.Learners must now navigate for 20 minutes using a sat-nav, and explain how to test the brakes, clean the windscreen and demist your windows while driving. However the new test does not seem to have bothered rookie drivers. In April 2017, under the old test, the pass rate was 48.8%, less than the rate in March 2018, in the new test.The data also shows that 58% of people taking their test for the first time managed to pass, with 142 learners succeeding first time with no minor faults. Drivers taking the test can pass with up to 15 minor faults, such as not checking your mirror at the right time.DVSA deputy chief driving examiner, Gordon Witherspoon, said: \u0026#8220DVSA\u0026#8217s priority is to help everyone through a lifetime of safe driving.\u0026#8220All candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.\u0026#8220We expect candidates and instructors to become more familiar with the new test and well continue to monitor the impact of the changes.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mccann wants to see physical sofien moussa in between the posts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has urged striker Sofien Moussa to get himself “between the posts” so he can add goals to his all-round play for Dundee.The Dark Blues front man failed to inspire confidence among the Dens Park support for much of last season.A late flurry of goals saw him finish with 12 in all competitions.And this campaign, he’s already started towards bettering that tally with two goals in the 4-0 win over Stirling Albion on Saturday.That’s despite a howler of a miss with the score at 0-0 before he changed his boots and 10 minutes later knocked in the openerNeil said: “I don’t know if the other boots were a wee bit tight or whatever but it was a super finish for his second one.“He knew I wasn’t happy with the first miss but his control of a great ball from Gense Kusunga was superb and it was a fine finish. Then it was a good header for the second.“That’s where I want him. Sometimes Moussa is a wee bit guilty of pulling into areas where it becomes difficult to score.“I want him between the posts because you can see how much of a physical presence he is.“I thought him and Mendy looked a good partnership and Craig Wighton was the icing on the cake.“He drifted from side to side and you can see the quality he’s got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5aec420f4b770.jpg ","title":"dundee has one of the highest smoking rates in britain","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee has one of the highest proportions of smokers in Britain, new figures have revealed.More than one in five people in Dundee smoke, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.That\u0026#8217s four times as many smokers as in Christchurch, Dorset, where just 4.6% of people smoke, the lowest percentage in Britain.However the number of smokers in Dundee is dropping, due to a successful and sustained anti-tobacco strategy from the government.In 2011, 27.3% of Dundee\u0026#8217s population smoked. By 2017 this figure had dropped to 20.8%.Smoking rates across the country are down overall.Deborah Arnott, Action on Smoking and Health chief executive, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have fallen because over the last twenty years the British Government has gone further and faster in tackling smoking.\u0026#8220Britain has kept its tobacco taxes amongst the highest in the world, banned advertising promotion and sponsorship, put tobacco out of sight in shops and replaced the glitzy, brightly coloured packs with ugly dark packs with large picture warnings.\u0026#8220But smoking must become history for all of society not just for the wealthy.\u0026#8220Cuts in public health funding and lack of treatment for smoking on the NHS mean poorer more heavily addicted smokers, including those who are pregnant, are not getting the help they need to quit.\u0026#8221The data also suggests that more young adults are shunning cigarettes.The percentage of Dundee\u0026#8217s population who have never smoked has risen by 20% since 2011, because 18 to 24-year-olds are choosing not to.Last year, across Britain, 17.8% of people in this age bracket said they were smokers.In 2011 more than a quarter of young adults said they smoked.This is the biggest drop in smokers out of any age group.Ms Arnott put this down to banning tobacco advertising.\u0026#8220The brightly coloured pack displays we used to have in shops disappeared completely in 2015 and the packs they see nowadays are a sludgy green colour, with large picture warnings, rather than the brightly coloured, highly branded packs we used to have.\u0026#8220Is it any wonder young people today increasingly choose not to smoke. It\u0026#8217s much less cool than it used to be.\u0026#8221This has been helped by the rise of e-cigarettes.The ONS estimates there are 2.8 million vapers in Britain, and almost half said their reason for taking it up was to stop smoking.Commenting on the figures, Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have dropped by almost a quarter in five years, a triumphant step in eliminating the nation\u0026#8217s biggest killer.\u0026#8220The data shows we are winning the war on tobacco and that we are tantalisingly close to creating the first-ever smoke-free generation in England.\u0026#8220But that war will only be won if we make more progress in helping people from deprived areas and people suffering from poor mental health, where we know smoking rates remain stubbornly high.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc51a376d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people asda ace jim checks out for the last time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAsda Ace Jim Dodds has checked out of work for the last time.Jim was a war baby born in 1941 but 77 years later the former roofer is only just putting his feet up.The great-grandfather started his working life in Dundee’s jute mills before becoming a roofer.He even helped to build his future workplace at Asda Kirkton more than 40 years ago.Jim and his wife Patricia, of Whitfield, have four daughters and two sons.Their family also now includes 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.One of Jim’s daughters, Debbie, even followed in his footsteps when she also became an Asda Ace and went on to work on the checkouts.Jim spent 15 years as an Asda Ace and for the last few years has been responsible for keeping the bakery and deli in tip-top condition.Samantha Will, community champion at Asda Kirkton, organised a special retirement lunch for the much-loved colleague.Jim was given a new set of wheels – in the shape of an inflatable walking frame.Debbie said: “My dad doesn’t actually want to give up work but it is time for him to go.“He was surprised by the retirement lunch – he didn’t think they were going to do anything for him.“My dad has never been unemployed.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time.

When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace.

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116630.jpg","title":"Schoolgirls inspiring bid to wipe out racism","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED eight-year-old has been praised after taking an inspirational stand against racism in her community by personally removing a vile message she found defacing a local mural.Breagha Gowans spotted the anti-Muslim slur scribbled on the wall of an underpass near Culloden Wood while out for a walk with her mother Michelle.After the pair had a chat about what exactly the message \u0026ndash which the Courier will not print \u0026ndash meant, the youngster decided to step up and take it upon herself to erase it, gathering a bag full of cleaning equipment for the job.\"I wanted to clean up the graffiti because I have a friend at school who is Muslim and I didn\u0026rsquot want her to be upset,\" she said.\"I wanted to be kind towards others.\"The underpass where Breagha spotted the graffiti passes below Barn Church Road and is covered in a colourful mural in a deliberate bid to dissuade would-be vandals from defacing the walls.After scrubbing the wall clean again, she appealed to everyone to show more respect towards those around them.\"Please don\u0026rsquot do it because it is hateful and no-one likes bullies,\" she said.\"It isn\u0026rsquot good to hurt people\u0027 feelings and I didn\u0026rsquot like to see something that would make someone feel bad.\"Breagha\u0027 father is Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans who said he was proud of the way she had decided to tackle the problem head-on.\"I told her it was fantastic \u0026ndash though like a typical eight-year-old she was off doing something else,\" he said.\"Breagha and her class have been learning about different religions at Inshes Primary School and she has a very strong sense of justice and fairness.\"It is a testament to what they are teaching in school.

I still live in the area, I’m based in the area, being out of the game I still follow Burnley as well.“We bump into each other quite a lot because we’re part of the League Managers’ Association. He knows how close Burnley is to my heart and I’ve always encouraged what he’s doing – not that he needs my encouragement!“It’s nice that we can talk on a level about Burnley and it pleases me that he is really prospering.“Sean’s had his ups and downs in the early part of his managerial career and he comes to Burnley and has managed to find the right club at the right time for him.“Now he has good control of the football club which is unusual in the modern game.“The people at the club and him listen to each other and they work well together.“They’ve backed him and it’s paid dividends.”Phelan worked with Pittodrie gaffer McInnes at Stockport when the latter was on loan at the Hatters from Rangers in 1998.McInnes has revitalised the Dons during his time in the Granite City.In five seasons in charge they have finished second in the Scottish Premiership four times and third once.In 2014 he guided Aberdeen to the League Cup, the first silverware won by the club since 1995.Phelan has been impressed by the job McInnes has done and added: “I know Derek quite well because he played when I was an assistant manager at Stockport County.“He’s done exceptionally well and he wants to push on because he’s had interest from other clubs and knocked it back.“He feels he has stability there which is great to hear.“They are both pushing on and improving these clubs. Dyche is probably a step ahead but Derek is not far away from him.“It’s nice to know in football that there are still places where a manager can go, put something together and achieve something.“If people have some success at a club they tend to stay for longer than those that don’t.“I’m really pleased for Derek and what he’s done.“It’s about the culture you are trying to create and produce as well on top of results.“He’s had the opportunity to do that and other clubs have tried to take him so he obviously feels that he is comfortable and has an understanding with people and appreciates that.“That is quite nice to know when football can be a very hit or miss and a dismissive game for coaches and managers.“It’s easy to be a bad manager when you lose three games in a row.“Derek has stuck at it and people have stuck with him which is refreshing.”During his brief time working with McInnes Phelan says it was clear to see he had a good footballing brain.And he is pleased to see he has carried that into his managerial career – although he does admit at the time there were no clear signs McInnes would go on to a success in management.Phelan said: “It would be easy in hindsight to say yes, but when you’re a player you concentrate on playing.“He must have seen it as the next best thing to playing and then after that it’s about getting an opportunity.“He had a footballing brain and was a good player and obviously observed a lot of what was going on around him in coaching and management.“He has taken that on and fair play to him for doing that.”Phelan has joined Central Coast Mariners as a sporting director, his first job since leaving then Premier League outfit Hull City in January 2017.But to keep himself occupied during the interim period along with some business partners he has set up Sensible Soccer which offers a variety of coaching services.Phelan has enjoyed that work but his desire was always to get back into the game.He said: “I just wanted to get around people who wanted me to take a coaching session and it’s just developed quite organically.“Universities have started to ask me to do some days here and there with sports students and get out on the training ground.“In the main we’ve been offering coaching services and consultancy which is going down well.“It gave me something to do.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen airport workers strike called off as bosses offer staff last minute 3 pay deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA last-minute pay offer to airport workers has been accepted – averting strike action later this week.Aberdeen International Airport said the new deal – believed to be a 3% pay offer – has been accepted by Unite the union.Unite and airport bosses held discussions with mediator Acason Monday and a 2.8% pay offerHowever that deal was rejected by airport staff rejected by airport staff, paving the wayThe union said the deal was turned down due to its lack of parity with fellow workers at Glasgow International Airport.

Major: believe in the “Cinderella story”.Rose was speaking at Carnoustie ahead of this week’s 147th Open Championship, the tournament where he himself burst on to the scene as an amateur.The Englishman was 17 when he holed from the rough to finish tied for fourth at Royal Birkdale in his first major in 1998 and has gone on to be one of golf’s biggest stars.Rose is the third-ranked player in the world, and won the US Open in 2013, as well as a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.Of how Scottish Amateur champion Locke should use this week, Rose said: “It’s eye-opening just being here.“And it’s such a thrill, I suppose. I haven’t seen him around, I haven’t met him yet. But I’d say, play as many practice rounds with terrific players as you can.“Guys you can probably learn from and see how they go about their business.“Just ask as many questions as possible, that’ll be a great opportunity to get some insight.“On the golf course, I’m sure he’s obviously a very good player, to be here.“Believe in yourself and, if there’s an opportunity to get on the leaderboard, it’ll be a great experience.“Go hoping for the Cinderella story. It’s possible, we’ve always seen an amateur do well at some points during the week.“Hopefully it can be Sam.”Locke, 19, who is mentored by and works for 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie, made it into this week’s field through final qualifying, as he attempts to carve out a career for himself in golf.He might be two years older than Rose was when he won the silver medal for leading amateur at Birkdale, but he’s a year younger than 14-time major champion Tiger Woods when he won the medal in 1996.Woods made his major debut the year before at the 1995 Masters.Locke said: “I didn’t know that about Tiger, to be honest. But, again, you go into an event to play the best you can.“At the same time, it’s nice to know a player like that played his first major at the same age as me.“Hopefully if I just keep working hard, playing the best I can, and keep on improving, you never know where it could get you.”Locke will play tomorrow and Friday with American Brandt Snedeker and Australian Cameron Davis, and how he performs will decide whether or not he turns pro.He said: “It depends how I do. I’ve played in a couple of pro events before but nothing of this magnitude.“We’ll see. It’s obviously going to be a really enjoyable week, but it depends how I play – that’ll make my decision.”For the moment, the young north-east hope is just preparing as best he can for what many consider the toughest test in Links golf.Lawrie is at the Open as mentor, but also fulfilling sponsorship commitments and media work, sharing the expertise which saw him bring the Claret Jug back to Aberdeen.Locke said: “Obviously to have any major champion helping you is great.“It’s a bonus he’s won the Open at the course it’s being played. I don’t know how it played in 1999 compared to how it’s going to play this year.“It’s the same lay-out, but to have him helping will be great.”He added: “You prepare for any weather. With links golf more than inland golf, the weather can change quicker.“But you’ve got to prepare for whatever mother nature brings, so you just deal with it and go there ready.“If it stays nice, it’s better to play in but, at the end of the day, we’re all still playing on the same day.“I’m just trying to prepare as I would for another event.“Yes I’m excited, but I’m there to try to play the best I can. So I’m preparing in the normal way and we’ll see what we can do.“Obviously, the best players in the world are in the tournament.“If I play really well, I could be paired with other guys who are playing well at the same time (for the weekend).“Whether that’s any of the top-ranked players in the world, you don’t know, but all these guys are playing in a major championship and they’re all really, really good.“I’m not too bothered who I get. I’m just going to be focused on my game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Scarlett is a member of the Glasgow-based UK Theatre School which works with a string of casting directors to showcase its students’ talents. She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time. It’s amazing now to see the ad now that it’s finished.” Her proud mum Tracey said: “We were grateful to the UKTS scheme who worked with Scarlett. She absolutely loved the whole experience.” UKTS principal Lizanne Lambie Thomson said: “All our students have the chance to sign up to our own exclusive in-house castings agency. Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it! We’re all very proud of her achievement in securing the part.” The UK Theatre School is based in Glasgow’s West Regent Street and has around 700 students.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonAyr NewsGlasgow"},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Ollar and D. Robertson, who had the energetic assistance of a most representative and capable committee of boat-owners and band of other devoted workers, the appeal made to the public for a full measure of that liberal support for which this locality has earned a name which is second to none struck a most responsive chord, with the result that the large hall was crowded to the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kitchen firm cooks up charity cash","story":"Recently Raymond Harvey of the Campbeltown Christmas lights group on left and Lewis MacKay from Castlehill primary football collected cheques from Howden\u0026#8217s manager Archie Martin centre. 25_c28howdens01_RaymondHarvey_ArchieMartin_LewisMackay\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simple pleasures of working outside in good weather","story":"NFU president Andrew McCornick said: \u0026#8216This year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year’s difficult harvest.\u0026#8216The recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members.\u0026#8216After suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather they have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.\u0026#8216The quality of winter fodder made to date is likely to be tremendous.\u0026#8216I am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity.\u0026#8216That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused.

Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.  The achievement was highlighted by school interim headteacher, Lauren Rodger, in her newsletter.  She added: \u0026ldquoAnyone seeing Clara perform here at Knox will know that she is a natural percussionist and we\u0026rsquore delighted for her."},{"url":null,"title":"kit-fraser-republishes-his-dads-story-of-time-with-macbrayne","story":"  Chris Fraser\u0026rsquos autobiography Christie Boy: A MacBrayne\u0026rsquos Man was released in 1994.  Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.  Kit, 66, who previously worked as a BBC correspondent, told the Courier he had \u0026ldquohalf an idea for another book but was still considering whether to put pen to paper once again.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

There\u0027s a word for it \u0026ndash cheating. pic.twitter/JwRkvglKKX          \u0026mdash Jo Swinson (@joswinson) July 17, 2018  During Prime Minister\u0026rsquos questions, Mrs May told MPs: \u0026ldquoThe breaking of the pair was done in error. It wasn\u0026rsquot good enough and will not be repeated.  The PM said the\u0026nbspchief whip and the Tory party chairman had \u0026ldquoapologised directly.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe take pairing very seriously and we recognise its value to Parliament and we will continue to guarantee a pair for MPs that are currently pregnant or have a newborn baby.  Labour said it was \u0026ldquohard to credit the account of the incident given by Mr Lewis and chief whip Julian Smith and called for fuller details.  A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoWe want a full explanation of what took place, given that he only seems to have been unaware about the pairing for the two closest votes.  \u0026ldquoIt is hard to credit the explanation that has been given.  Mrs May said the Government was \u0026ldquolooking very careful at proposals for proxy voting.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at the interests of individuals but also the interests of the whole House, she added.  Mr Smith apologised and said Mr Lewis has been \u0026ldquoasked to vote in error.          Jo I am v sorry-I spoke to your CW earlier. A mistake \u0026ndash we pair consistently 4 pregnancy pairs \u0026ndash @BrandonLewis was asked to vote in error. https://t.co/BYRmprapGn          \u0026mdash Julian Smith MP (@JulianSmithUK) July 17, 2018  Mr Lewis said it was an \u0026ldquohonest mistake made by the whips in \u0026ldquofast-moving circumstances.  But Ms Swinson said it was \u0026ldquoneither honest, nor a mistake and the Government\u0026rsquos response was \u0026ldquonot credible.  Mr Lewis had missed earlier votes, but took part in the two crunch divisions on the Trade Bill.  The pairing system operates by making sure that if an MP on one side of an argument is unable to vote, an opponent also sits out the division to even it out.  A furious Ms Swinson revealed that Mr Lewis had voted, asking Mrs May: \u0026ldquoJust how low will your Government stoop?          I\u0026rsquom sorry Jo. I think it was an honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances. I know how important the pair is to everyone, especially new parents, and I apologise. Also apologies for late reply, been speaking at an event.          \u0026mdash Brandon Lewis (@BrandonLewis) July 17, 2018  Accusing the Tories of \u0026ldquocheating, she said it was a \u0026ldquocalculated, deliberate breaking of trust by the Government whips to \u0026ldquowin at all costs.  She added that the Government\u0026rsquos response to discrimination against pregnant women and new mums had been \u0026ldquoshockingly poor, so \u0026ldquoperhaps it should be no surprise they treat MPs on [maternity] leave like this.  Shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler said it was an \u0026ldquoabsolutely appalling move.          Absolutely appalling move by the Conservative Party chairman. Parliament needs to be dragged into the 21st century and Brandon Lewis must personally apologise for his role in making politics even more inaccessible for new mums. @theresa_may! https://t.co/qe7TJ8ZbuU          \u0026mdash (((Dawn Butler MP))) (@DawnButlerBrent) July 17, 2018  The Government avoided defeat by just six votes over an amendment which could have required the UK to join a customs union after Brexit if a trade deal was not in place by January.  Ms Swinson gave birth to her son Gabriel on June 29.  Mr Lewis told her: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sorry Jo. I think it was an honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances.  Mr Smith also apologised for the mistake and said he had spoken to his Lib Dem counterpart Alistair Carmichael about it.  Mr\u0026nbspCarmichael, who secured an urgent question on the matter, later told ministers that events were \u0026ldquosymptomatic\u0026nbspof a wider problem.  He said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt is using a 19th century practice to provide for cover under 21st century employment law and that is no longer good enough.          Listen to the Prime Minister, @theresa_may, answer questions from MPs in the House of Commons Chamber #PMQs https://t.co/kmnC6Ny9iG          \u0026mdash UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons) July 18, 2018  The Lib Dem chief whip went on to tell MPs that the situation\u0026nbsphad improved\u0026nbspsince he was first elected in 2001, when his son was 10-weeks old, but more needed to be done.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen I was first elected children were not to be seen and certainly not to be heard\u0026nbspwithin the House.  \u0026ldquoI remember I once had to change my younger son\u0026rsquos nappy in the member\u0026rsquos cloak room were obviously\u0026nbsphe shouldn\u0026rsquot\u0026nbsphave been because\u0026nbsphe wasn\u0026rsquot a member on a copy of the Daily Record because there\u0026nbspwas no changing mats.  \u0026ldquoWe have come a long way, but anybody who thought that we had done it all and there was no more left to be done was sadly disabused\u0026nbsplast night.          We are delighted to welcome Gabriel Peter Kelvin Hames to the world. He arrived, happy and healthy, at 5:53am on Friday, weighing 7lb. Gabriel has two overjoyed parents and one very excited big brother. pic.twitter/TsMgxXyObJ          \u0026mdash Jo Swinson (@joswinson) July 1, 2018  Ms Leadsom responded saying the situation that transpired \u0026ldquowas not good enough and again offered an apology on behalf of the Government.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom assured by the Chief Whip that the breaking\u0026nbspof the pair yesterday was done entirely\u0026nbspin error and will not be repeated.  Speaker John Bercow said MPs should \u0026ldquodecide the issue when it is debated, adding: \u0026ldquoI think there is a concern about potentially an endless debate.  Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz urged the Government to come to an agreement on Wednesday with other parties to \u0026ldquonod through those MPs on baby leave for every vote.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe could ensure those voting by this means are denoted with a \u0026lsquoP\u0026rsquo or, to make it really up to date, and I hope Hansard has this, a baby emoji, therefore giving full transparency to the public.  Tory MP Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) urged the Commons to \u0026ldquomodernise before saying: \u0026ldquoDragging in sick and heavily pregnant members does not send a good message to the public \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not good enough for us to be OK in here, we have\u0026nbspto be better than OK in everything we do."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8067002.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-nine-hidden-gems-in-argyll-and-bute","story":"  Paddle Steamer Waverley  Join Waverley this summer for a magical journey.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

According the Balornock church\u0027s website, the service was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \u0026ldquocelebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.  But last night Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University, held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTI event.  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \u0026ldquoThis was a private parish devotion unrelated\u0026nbspto Father\u0026nbspMorris\u0026rsquos role as chaplain.  Jordan added: \"We are concerned about the message that this could send to the young people of Glasgow Caledonian University, and so would like to stress that these predictable voices of opposition are becoming increasingly drowned out by a Catholic and wider faith community which is supportive of LGBT equality.  \"There were many people of faith who attended the Parade this weekend and in our efforts to advance LGBT-inclusive education in schools, we have been strongly supported by numerous Catholic Priests and their parishioners, as well as Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church ministers.  \"Our experience working with the Scottish Catholic Education Service as part of the Scottish Government\u0027s LGBT Inclusive Education Working Group has also been nothing but positive and productive.  \"We know that those who support the LGBT community outweigh those who endorse intolerance and I imagine that the number of attendees to this service in contrast with those who attended the Pride parade would further prove that.\"  Glasgow Caledonian University and the Catholic Church in Glasgow have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8083985.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ghosts-have-a-dispiriting-effect-on-home-values-finds-study","story":"  At least that is the claim of a new study which reveals that supposedly haunted houses are having thousands of pounds wiped off their value the moment they are investigated for paranormal activity.  Statistician Dr Geoff Ellis said his study into 25 British \"haunted houses\", sold over the last half-century, revealed they lost an average of 17 per cent off their value compared with the sale prices of similar homes nearby.  What was said to be Scotland\u0027s most haunted house lay empty for decades before it was finally sold.  The eerie 18th century home, called Windhouse, nestled in the centre of a tiny island nature reserve, had only one permanent resident since the 1920s - a ghostly apparition known as the \"lady in silk\".    Legend had it the haunting was the result of one event, in the 19th century. The house\u0027s then-owner, a man called Harrison, decided that sheep would be more profitable than people and evicted his tenants in a mini Highland clearance.  One old lady, forced from her home, is said to have cursed Windhouse and everyone who would ever live in it.  Ghostly inhabitants have since included a lady dressed in silk who is believed to be the spirit of a woman whose skeleton was found under floorboards of the main stairs.  So called because of the rustling sound of her dress and petticoats, the ghoul was said to walk three times in a circle at the top of a flight of stairs, give a sigh, and then disappear.    The Grade-C listed home on Yell, Shetland which was first built in 1707 and then rebuilt in 1880, was eventually bought in 2003 by the couple from Cheshire who fell in love with the place and planned to renovate the castellated house. But it fell through.  Twelve years later the building which is on Historic Environment Scotland\u0027s buildings at risk register was put back on the market, with offers above \u0026pound25,000 and prospective purchasers were advised not to enter the site because of the building\u0027s extremely dangerous condition.  Dr Ellis\u0027s research suggests having a haunted house would knock almost \u0026pound40,000 off the average UK property price when it came to selling it.  A separate survey of 2,000 Britons found nearly one in four believed their houses were haunted, while 55% said they would be put off buying a haunted house.  The study, believed to be the first in the world looking at paranormal property, was commissioned by TV channel Really to mark the new series of Help! My House Is Haunted.    Barri Ghai, Sandy Lakdar and Chris Fleming from Help! My House is Haunted on Really  Adam Collings, Really channel director said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos staggering how much money could be wiped-off the value of your property, should you feel your house is haunted and eye-opening to see just how many of us have experienced spooky goings-on at home.  \"The research suggests it\u0026rsquos probably a good idea to keep your eyes peeled for paranormal activity when viewing a property, as your new house could become a very bad investment when you come to sell it, should it be found to be haunted.  The gloomy findings also found that well over half of the Scottish respondents (61%) say they\u0026rsquod be put off buying a haunted house, whilst 27% of property buyers have felt a spooky presence when viewing a house, which has put them off buying.  It certainly did not appear to put off Prince Charles who bought Dumfries House, a then dilapidated 18th century Scottish mansion that he saved for the nation at the 11th hour, 11 years ago.  It was put on the market and its contents were already on their way to an auction house ready to be sold off. But a group convened by the prince secured the property and its furniture for \u0026pound45m, with \u0026pound20m personally guaranteed by Charles himself.    The Duchess of Cornwall recently admitted that a visit to the rundown mansion soon after its purchase left her spooked and that she was unable to enter for several years after being convinced it was haunted.  \"It had a really eerie feel about it,\" she said. \"There was definitely a ghost. Without a shadow of a doubt. I remember the first time I walked up the steps, got into the hall and I thought I can\u0027t go any further. I literally froze. If my hair could stand on end, it would have done.  \"I remember leaving and thinking I don\u0027t want to come back here again and I didn\u0027t for a few years.\"  Camilla would later become more accustomed to the house\u0027s idiosyncrasies .  Given the survey results, it was perhaps unsurprising to find that eight in ten Scots (80%) polled said they would lie to their estate agent to cover up the fact their house was haunted to avoid the financial consequences."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-at-reservoir-after-reports-a-teenager-was-in-the-water","story":"  Emergency vehicles were sent to Glenburn Reservoir near Paisley after the alarm was raised at about 17:35.

A wide-ranging study of the nation\u0027s telly time has revealed that the over-55s have claimed the crown as the chieftain of the couch potato race, spending almost four times as much watching broadcasts compared to their offspring.  Last year, those heading for retirement age spent and nearly six hours a day transfixed by their living room screen, compared to just an hour and a half for those aged between 4 and 15.  And while the number of minutes whiled away by the older generation watching soaps, dramas and documentaries has fallen in recent years, it is still almost two hours greater than the national average of nearly four hours a day uncovered by Ofcom\u0027s first Media Nations Scotland report.  Overall, Scots watch more TV than people living in other parts of the UK, the report said, with viewers north of the border spending a daily average of three hours and 46 minutes in front of their sets - 24 minutes more than the UK average of three hours and 23 minutes.    And they are watching a wide range of programmes. The report delved into the most popular shows last year and found that terrestrial TV is still pulling in audiences in the millions.  It helps to go big \u0027event\u0027 TV, such as the final of Strictly Come Dancing the Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys Christmas special, pulled in the most viewers as did reality shows I\u0027m a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here! and Britain\u0027s Got Talent.  But there was also a place for \u0027quality\u0027 television, with the ten-years-in-the-making series Blue Planet II and big-budget dramas Broadchurch and The Moorside also proving to be hits with the audience.  The Strictly final was the most-viewed broadcast programme on television across Scotland in 2017, with more than 1.1 million viewers tuning in to watch Scottish actor and Former Holby City star Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones lift the glitterball trophy.  Other hits for the year included the BBC\u0027s long-running Hogmanay show and its football-related stablemate Only and Excuse, Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Sherlock.  The BBC and ITV dominated terrestrial viewing habits, sharing all slots in a top-20 league table of the\u0026nbsp nation\u0027s most-watched programmes between them.  Yet while both channels remain strong, Ofcom found that people are slowly turning their backs on traditional TV.  On average, Scots are tuning in for 46 fewer minutes each day than they did eight years ago, and the decline is even steeper among children.  Youngsters have cut the amount of TV they consume each day by an hour - and the trend is accelerating.  But while people in Scotland are watching less broadcast television, they are spending more time watching other things such as online streaming on their TV set.    Daily viewing of non-broadcast content, such as YouTube and subscription on-demand services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, increased to 40 minutes.  BBC iPlayer was the most popular on-demand/streaming service among adults in Scotland in January 2018, with almost half saying they used it, followed by Netflix and the STV Player.  The report found the use of Netflix is \"heavily skewed towards younger viewers\".  While a third of adults in Scotland claim to use the service at least once a week, the number doubles among 16-24-year-olds while half of\u0026nbsp 25-34s say they use it.  But the service, which relies on an understanding of new technology, has not been taken up by baby boomers - with fewer than one in ten saying they tuned in.  The report said that the BBC, STV and ITV spent a combined \u0026pound53.9m on first-run, UK-made programmes for viewers in Scotland, an 8 per cet real-terms decrease year-on-year.  It said this decline was the result of lower spending by the BBC, down by 10 per cent year on year, while STV/ITV spending remained broadly stable.  The report also examined trends in the radio and audio sectors and found the amount of time people spent listening to digital radio has continued to grow, with two thirds of Scots now owning one.\u0026nbsp Almost nine in ten (88%) of adults listen to the radio every week.  On average, adults in Scotland spend 14 hours four minutes each week listening to any type of audio, the majority of it live radio.  Glenn Preston, Ofcom\u0027s Scotland Director, said: \"Today\u0027s research shows that the way people in Scotland watch TV is changing rapidly.  \"Although viewers in Scotland watch more TV than in the rest of the UK, they are spending less time watching \u0027traditional\u0027 broadcast TV and are turning to online streaming services, attracted by their exclusive programmes and vast libraries of classic shows.  \"Broadcasters in Scotland must confront the challenges posed by both online streaming companies and the changing way people are watching television, to ensure they continue to make great shows to appeal to Scottish viewers in the digital age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"so-scots-and-londoners-are-different-think-again","story":"  That is because a major new analysis of Britain\u0026rsquos most robust social attitudes survey shows that the UK capital shares more values with Scotland than with its own hinterland.  The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found Scots and Londoners were the most left-wing and liberal Britons with more in common with each other than with Wales and provincial England.  The new work overturns long-standing assumptions on both sides of the Border that Scotland has more cultural and political affinity with the north of England than the south.  Some 60 per cent of Scots identify as left-wing, compared with 58% of Londoners and just 51% of Northerners. But Londoners and Scots were also the most likely to back tax-and-spend policies and sympathise with people on welfare.  Neil Smith, research director at Natcen, said: \u0026ldquoWhile there are clear distinctions in the way Londoners think about certain social and political issues, in quite a few instances \u0026ndash despite the geographical distance and the different make-ups of our populations \u0026ndash Londoners share more in common with the Scots than with their regional neighbours. Both are more likely to be engaged in politics, have the greatest proportion of left-affiliated individuals, are more likely to fall on the pro-welfare end of the scale, and are most inclined to sympathise with benefit claimants.  The survey comes two years after Scotland and London emerged as the only two \u0026ldquoregions of the island of Britain to oppose Brexit.  London has become a stronghold for Labour in southern England. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, shares the distinction with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \u0026ndash reports suggest \u0026ndash- despised by America\u0026rsquos populist right president.  Similar social attitudes may also reflect the rarely acknowledged reality that Scotland, collectively, has higher living standards and economic activity than anywhere in the UK bar London and the south-east.  The analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey carried out by NatCen, and considered one of the best snap shots of what people think.  It was commissioned by Trust for London, a charity and think- tank. The Trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Bharat Mehta, stressed what he saw as common values across the UK.  He said: \u0026ldquoPart of the story is the striking similarities between the attitudes of Londoners and those of Scots. The other part, is how on important issues like equality, education and public spending, Londoners hold comparable views to everyone else."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-guitarist-brian-may-to-celebrate-work-of-victorian-royal-photographer","story":"  George Washington Wilson, from Aberdeen, spearheaded a form of 3D imagery which captured the imagination of the musician a century later.

The school launched its ‘Coding Club’, for children in primaries four to seven, which focuses on building the knowledge and skills of coding in order to deliver the next generation of digital creators.                                                     Expro’s funding will supply Lego WeDo 2.0 sets that allow the children to design, build and control their devices to complete a range of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) challenges.          The Apple Parrot drones are used by the older children to programme flight paths, manoeuvres and even aerobatic tricks for the drones to perform in order to complete set challenges - or just to impress.Andy Gould, IT Solutions Architect for Expro, said: “In an increasingly digital age, the knowledge and skills of coding are becoming more important for our next generation of school children.“We have seen the demand for apps and technology in the workplace increase exponentially, therefore future generations who can build/develop these will have a significant career advantage.“The equipment we’ve donated to the new coding club harnesses the enthusiasm shown by the pupils, allowing them to build their skills and confidence in this area. It’s been inspiring to see them embrace this technology so quickly, often outperforming the adults in the room.”                                                                                                        Cara Hay, Depute Head Teacher at Strathburn Primary School, added: “We are extremely grateful to Expro for its generous donation towards the development of our Coding Club.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 2:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What’s more, on still summer evenings it’s really nice to hear the students’ voices echoing across the harbour before we set off to sail.As the Year of Young People progresses throughout 2018 Mr Garrett said that Serco Northlink will be continuing to celebrate this special year with additional partnerships with the local community and its youngest residents.”Leah Hamilton from Stromness Primary School was one of the pupils chosen for the recording, which she found very enjoyable.“It was great fun recording the announcement,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220It only took us a few attempts and we were pleased with the final message.“We know that safety is important when travelling anywhere so we hope that the new announcement will help NorthLink Ferries’ passengers listen to the briefing and follow the steps carefully.”\u0026nbsp            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Wednesday 18 Jul 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770159.1531902954!/image/image.jpg","title":"manish jethwa glasgow can be the uk s landmark low emission city","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The Scottish Government has unveiled plans to work with councils to introduce low-emission zones (LEZs) in Scotland\u0026#8217s four biggest cities by 2020. The objective is clear: to reduce emissions and improve air quality across Scotland.                Glasgow plans to have Scotland’s first LEZ in place by the end of this year and it will eventually result in all but the cleanest-engine vehicles being banned from the city centre. That is one key way in which the city could work towards its key goal of lowering emissions, but what else can the authorities do to achieve not just this core aim but also the wider goal of reducing air pollution?            New technology that connects a range of different infrastructure together potentially has a big role to play. The latest advances in ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) technology allow cities to connect to street lights, buildings, bridges, drainage systems and other infrastructure to monitor and analyse how they interact. This can form the foundation for local authorities’ development of smart cities or regions with reducing emissions an important part of this.            READ MORE: Fears raised that Scotland’s firs low-emission zone will have little impactLocal authorities across Scotland already have networks of automatic monitoring stations in place to capture relevant data from various points and assess air quality. Sensors can be installed on street lights above the reach of vandals but at a level low enough to measure the air people are breathing.The data collected allows councils to monitor pollution levels and then adjust their strategy around road building, transport planning and pedestrianisation, for example, both to keep emissions to a minimum and reduce the impact they have on the wider public. Power and communication can be delivered through the street infrastructure and the wider smart city network. Linked to this, cities could also look to further cut emissions by reducing the number of traffic hotspots in the areas under their control. That’s essentially about pinpointing where traffic is heaviest. The UK is currently a very congested nation. Back in 2016, analytics company Inrix monitored traffic on every road in 123 cities, including London, Glasgow, Rome and Madrid. Its analysis revealed more than 20,300 so-called “traffic hotspots” in UK cities – well over double the number in Germany and twice that of France.READ MORE: Glasgow’s Internet of Things network expandsKnowing where the main points of congestion are is half the battle. Armed with that knowledge, councils can start to mitigate the problem by introducing new approaches to traffic signalling, for example, or by enhancing communication with other road users through better signposting. Dynamic traffic forecasting is another fast-emerging technology that these Scottish cities could potentially make use of. The approach connects infrastructure assets and devices to improve mobility across cities, thereby helping to reduce the time vehicles are on the road and, by extension, minimise emissions. Sensors at parking spots could collect real-time data on parking availability and be transmitted across networks, linking with end-user and local authority devices. Traffic control cameras could be connected to the transport authority in real time, enabling them to potentially increase the frequency and duration of green lights depending on road conditions.            It’s yet another example of how the smartest Scottish cities can successfully implement low-emission zones and keep pollution levels to a minimum over the coming years by adopting the latest technology solutions to monitor and measure the current situation – and then take action.Manish Jethwa is chief technology officer at Yotta"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770387.1531910469!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp mp angus macneil calls for indyref2 within a year","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

It needs to be fixed. \nWe all deserve to live in a shared society.\nThesectarian hate crimes and scenes of violence which marked the ‘Twelth’ must bemade a thing of the past.\n\nSinn Féin has repeatedly sought to engage the DUP in discussions aboutanti-sectarianism and reconciliation.\nTheyhave refused to have those progressive discussions because some whocurrently dominate within that Party prefer communal and political divisioninstead of a united and shared society.\nThe Orange culture should indeed be respected. So too should the Irishlanguage, Gaelic culture and Irish identity.\nThe Good Friday Agreement was not about winners and losers.\nThe principles of mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality belong to allsides.\nThe politics of fear and division must be rejected.\nWe need a real and meaningful discussion about how we can share a vision forthe future and build towards reconciliation.\nA good start would be to start a genuine dialogue between Sinn Féin and OrangeOrder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27418  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately. - Pat Sheehan\nA solidarity rally will be held in Belfast this evening following the attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey. \nThe rally will take place at the site of the former Andersonstown barracks and will be addressed by Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald. \nGerry Adams and Bobby Storey are also expected to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration. \nThe homes of both men were attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning when explosive devices were thrown. \nCCTV footage from the scene of the attack on Gerry Adams\u0027 home shows that a device was thrown from a passing car. \nAs well as to show solidarity with the two leading republicans and their families, this evening\u0027s rally has also been organised as a further show of solidarity with the people of Derry\u0027s Bogside following six nights of disturbances in the area last week. \nWest Belfast Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration in order to send a message to those behind the attacks. \n“The attacks involving explosive devices on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey were cowardly and reprehensible.\n“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change.\n“Sinn Féin will continue to represent this community and pursue our agenda for change, for peace and for a new agreed and united Ireland.\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately,\" he said. \nThe rally will be held tonight at 7pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27419  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nAttacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that. - Mary Lou McDonald\nThose responsible for the bomb attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey, and the recent disturbances in Derry, have no \"plan, strategy or vision for the future,\" Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said. \nThe Sinn Féin leader made the remarks ahead of a rally in Belfast tonight to show solidarity with Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey whose homes were attacks with explosive devices at the weekend. \nSpeaking to the media in Belfast alongside Sinn Féin vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill and West Belfast MLA Pat Sheehan, the Sinn Féin president encouraged people to attend tonight\u0027s rally in Andersonstown. \nMary Lou McDonald said Sinn Féin would not be intimidated by such attacks and added that communities will not be bullied by those intent on causing violence and disruption. \n“There is no appetite, no excuse and no purpose behind the violence that occurred,\" she said. \n\"Attacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that,\" the Dublin Central TD added. \nThe Sinn Féin President said that those intent on violence have nothing to offer society. \n“Michelle and I were in Derry on Friday, we spoke to the people in the Bogside - they made it very clear how angry they are at a very small element that has brought hardship and trouble and panic in some cases to elderly residents and I know here in Belfast there is widespread anger.\n“There is zero tolerance for any element that would set out to cause harm or to cause disruption.\n“Those intent on this disruption have no political plan, have no political strategy, have no vision for the future.

Arthur Cottage is only a short walk from the village of Cullybackey, and is the ancestral home of Chester Alan Arthur, the 21st President of the United States of America. Arthur Cottage can provide an educational experience for all ages with baking demonstrations over the open turf fire and staff dressed in period costume. Traditional Music Nights are held in the Cottage throughout the year. We are getting ready for a busy summer season and are sure the visitors will enjoy the improved gardens on site.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8571142.1531912127!/image/image.jpg","title":"decrease in local unemployment levels","story":"\nThe number of people registering as out of work in Ballymena has dropped over the past month, latest figures have revealed.\n\n                \nAccording to the latest Labour Force Survey figures published for the month of June, the local claimant count now stands at 775 claimants - a decrease of 40 claimants from May. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWards in the Ballymena district registering the most claimants for unemployment were Ballee with 60 (65 in May) Castle Demesne with 55 claimants (no change from May) Dunclug with 55 claimants (no change from May) Harryville with 55 (no change from May) and Moat with 45 (55 in May). \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Ballymena wards with the lowest claimant counts were Slemish with 10 claimants (15 in May) Dunminning with 15 (15 in May) and Ballyloughan with 15 (15 in May).\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAcross the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area, there were 1,880  people registering as claimants, compared to 1,975 the previous month.\n\nOf the registered claimants in the borough, 1,240 were male and 640 were female.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Antrim district, the number of people registering as out of work has seen a decline for the fourth month in a row.\n\nIn June, a total of 595 people registered were registered as out of work, compared to 675 in February, 660 in March, 645 in April, and 630 in May.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe wards with the highest number of claimants were Crumlin with 60 ( 65 in May) and Springfarm with 60 (no change from May).\n\nThe wards with the lowest number of claimants were Aldergrove, Clady, Drumanaway, Shilvodan, and Templepatrick, each with 15 claimants.\n\nIn June, the number of people on the claimant count in Northern Ireland (which includes some out-of-work claimants of Universal Credit) was was 28,600 (3.1% of the workforce). \n\nThis represents a decrease of 200 from the previous month’s revised figure.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8571552.1531912320!/image/image.jpg","title":"floral display marks girls brigade s 125th anniversary","story":"\nA new floral display at the Larne Link Road in Ballymena is celebrating 125 years of the Girls\u0026#8217 Brigade. \n\n                \nThere are over 50 GB companies in Mid and East Antrim who meet weekly, with over 3,000 girls and 700 leaders involved.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nGirls’ Brigade Northern Ireland offers Bible teaching, physical activity, community and church service for girls aged three to 18. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThey also learn new skills and take on new challenges, including residential trips and arts projects.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThis year sees the Girls’ Brigade celebrating 125 years of supporting the development of young women.
