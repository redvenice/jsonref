Jay-Z and Beyoncé have encouraged fans to try plant-based foods as has Winfrey, while Portman is a high-profile advocate of veganism.The $200m-share sale is a big moment for the food business, which, after several decades in the Swedish wilderness, is enjoying stratospheric growth thanks to a combination of guerrilla marketing and good timing. When one first-time drinker declared “it tastes like shit!” the company printed the view on its cartons.Petersson, who claims to hate the limelight, has also featured in its ads, i memorably where he is standing alone in a field with a synthesiser, singing “Wow, no cow!” over and over. “I hate being in any commercial but I also understand the company is its people,” he says. “It’s not a logo.”Sustainability reports are typically a dry affair but Oatly’s cut to the chase, offering a no-nonsense translation of what its promise to be “a good company” means. In short: “Don’t be evil fucks!”This irreverent style has made oats sexy to under-40s trying to make more sustainable food choices. Oatly’s sales nearly doubled to $200m in 2019 and Petersson sees similar growth this year albeit with a coronavirus-sized caveat.Petersson, who is half Japanese and did not eat dairy products as a child, says: “It’s about getting a lot of people to make small changes, and by doing that, creating a shift on a massive scale rather than try to turn everybody vegan.”The cash injection will be used to build a global network of factories. With The US now its biggest market. a second site is being built in Utah while a plant in Singapore will help its push into Asian markets. “Beyond that we need more factories and, the final decision has not been made, but it will probably be the UK because it’s going to be such a massive market for us,” he says.Although founded in the early 1990s, Oatly was little known outside Sweden until the arrival of the arrival of Petersson in 2012. The entrepreneur has made the brand stand out by hammering home the message that oat milk is better for the planet than producing cow’s milk, which generates higher greenhouse gas emissions.“I’m doing this because I have kids,” says Petersson of his motivation, which was informed by a five-year sabbatical spent living in Costa Rica. “When you’re there you’re so in tune with nature and you see climate change first-hand. You see extreme drought and extreme rainfall and what that does to people. I realised that when I move back to Sweden I wanted to do something that mattered.”Oatly has come a long way from the labs of Lund University where in the early 90s Prof Rickard Öste – who co-founded the company with his brother Björn – set out to develop a plant-based alternative to cow’s milk. Öste’s patents underpin the manufacturing process and the academic remains the company’s head of science.The company is being tipped for a stock market listing although Petersson is tightlipped about what the future could hold. Big investors have been pouring money into plant-based food companies such as Beyond Meat, gambling that the number of people embracing vegan and vegetarian diets or becoming flexitarian (reducing their meat intake) will continue to grow.It has taken a hit from the lockdowns, which have crippled the coffee shop trade that was key to creating demand for alternative milks with their Instagrammable oat cold brews and coconut milk lattes.Alex Beckett, an analyst at Mintel, suggests the trend is evidence of people’s desire to make a difference: “Even before Covid-19, we were seeing a growing interest in plant-based food and drink. It may well be the pandemic is accelerating this trend.”The naysayers however, say we are less than five years away from peak plant milk. While oat milk sales are booming, the demand for soy and almond milks has already plateaued in the UK. But Petersson bats away suggestions that oat milk is a fad, insisting the market is only in its infancy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea61988ba1c3f85889d2631c18417bac168fa946/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3409e93c007d41e96772c189244ba1f","title":"britain crossroads dread hope politicians","story":"Our politicians are lacking in imagination, so it is up to us to make the case for the type of country we want to live inBoris Johnson may be calling for a return to offices and hoping for a return to “significant normality” by Christmas, but the feeling of dread hanging over this strange, uneasy summer is becoming inescapable. A second wave of Covid-19 now seems to be a racing certainty. And a gathering avalanche of numbers attests to an economic disaster that is probably already upon us.For all the noise it generates, politics is failing us. The government presents a spectacle of absurd displacement activity, purging the higher ranks of the civil service, doubling down on Brexit, and floating plans to yet again reorganise the NHS. If you want a conclusive symbol of conservatism’s passage into the politics of grim surrealism, consider that £705m is about to be spent on a “Brexit border” centred on a vast lorry park in Ashford, Kent, where hauliers will play out the futile stupidity of our exit from the EU on an hourly basis.The left, meanwhile, has its own problems. Even if the Labour party seems to be in the early stages of reconnecting with the electorate, its reaction to the defeat of Corbynism has so far been a pronounced policy inertia. And beyond Westminster, the most vocal elements of supposedly progressive opinion seem to have more to say about so-called cancel culture and letters in high-end American magazines than they do about a social and economic disaster that could be worse even than that of the 1930s. As symbols of the myopic smallness of politics in the face of gigantic challenges, the right has its very odd campaign against face masks my side has month-long arguments about JK Rowling.How, then, to get over a mounting feeling of fatalism and fear? Last week, I immersed myself in the latest writings from Anthony Barnett, the veteran thinker and activist whose work goes back to the watershed of 1968. His expansive, ideas-filled book, The Lure of Greatness, was by far the best treatise on the politics of Brexit. Now, in an extended online essay cheerily titled Out of the Belly of Hell, he has turned his attention to the Covid-19 crisis, and what it means for the way in which many countries have been run for the past few decades. What is compelling about what he says is its ambitious historical sweep and sense of possibility: the gift of coronavirus, he insists, is that it “makes it clear that the future of humanity is a matter of our choice”.Globalisation, as Barnett sees it, has two increasingly irreconcilable aspects. It embeds “profit maximisation and marketisation” but also a generalised capacity for people to become citizens, with expectations of rights and protections. Millions of us might be exploited, but we also have a deep awareness that “we share the same planet … at the same time as each other”. In ensuring one of these aspects has clashed with the other, the pandemic has commenced a new era, so far manifested not just in the politics of the virus itself but in what has swirled around it: the Black Lives Matter upsurge is the most obvious example, and there will soon be more.Everything changed when economies were effectively suspended to save lives: as a result Covid-19 “has precipitated an ideological breakdown”. But breakdowns are not the same as revolutions: “You can recover and be strengthened by the experience or just go back to how you were … The outcome is decided afterwards and has to be achieved, it is never inherent in the crisis.” We are now faced with the “incompatibility between the economic market dogma that claimed to shape the wealth creation of the world, and an expectation of the right to life that, it turned out, accompanied its growth”. The two key questions of our time are whether a more human, collectivist way of thinking can finally be pushed to the fore, and what a different kind of economy and society might look like.If the absence of these big themes from the mainstream conversation around coronavirus is frustrating, the solution is surely to begin talking about them anyway, and thinking on a scale commensurate with that of the crisis itself. In the short to medium term, we may soon have to move to a partially directed economy, whereby we embrace the logic of a green new deal, and shift labour and resources from parts of the economy fast being left behind to more sustainable ones. By way of putting people to work and beginning to move against the social conditions that have exacerbated Britain’s experience of the outbreak, we need a huge public housing programme, partly focused on repurposing the town and city centres that are now in urgent need of reinvention. The line between paid work and voluntary activity and care ought to be blurred by a basic income. The way we collectively deliver public services should be reshaped by what Barnett calls an “explosion of empathy, social awareness and networking”, recently seen in the way that spontaneous community action has helped people affected by the virus.Which brings us to what kind of state we should want. As I have written a lot recently, England’s handling of the pandemic proves that its creaking, centralised system of government, full of ossified practices and institutionalised prejudice, needs to be thoroughly localised and democratised. This is the best way to safeguard against future pandemics and outbreaks. As opposed to the Johnson-Cummings model, whereby regeneration is somehow to be dropped on places from on high, it is also how new economic futures can be shaped by the people who will deliver and benefit from them.The 21st century’s digital blur means we tend to think that truly historic events are things frozen in black and white, or chronicled in epic documentaries. But make no mistake: more than any other period in most of our lifetimes, this a time of massive significance, bringing with it a sense of both crisis and opportunity. Amid constant detours and distractions, all of us need to think about the future before it hits us like a hammer. The problem with dread, after all, is that sooner or later it becomes self-fulfilling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc05d1251e063a15089dc8130e6d06afed017020/0_387_5805_3483/master/5805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc42f7d91d73e9cf2e93ecd5c1290d5","title":"the guardian view on improving public health a job for the nanny state","story":"Boris Johnson wants to do something about obesity levels in England. It will take more than upbeat rhetoric and input from Joe WicksEnglish libertarians like to believe that their instinctive inidualism chimes with something essential in the national soul: the right of the freeborn Englishman not to be bossed about. It was in that sentimental spirit that the Conservative MP, Desmond Swayne, became ostentatiously overwrought in the House of Commons last week, on the subject of face masks.Mr Swayne condemned the government’s decision to make face coverings compulsory in shops as a “monstrous imposition” on personal freedoms. Happily it turns out that, much as he would like to, the MP for New Forest West does not speak for England. A substantial majority approve of the new mask rules. In fact, the consistent evidence suggests that the appetite is for more, not less, regulation and guidance for collective behaviour in the interests of public health.A survey last month found that, in light of the Covid‑19 pandemic, close to nine out of 10 people believe that national government has either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of responsibility for ensuring that people stay healthy. The scrupulous observance of lockdown rules by the vast majority of people was the other side of this coin. As Sir Michael Marmot, professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London, has observed, the diligent following of the rules indicates “a strong sense of social responsibility” at work.What the prime minister makes of this enthusiasm for the “nanny state” is intriguing. Mr Johnson was a very late convert to the argument for masks, and only after much prevarication. But following his near-death experience with Covid-19 in March, his libertarian instincts, by his own account, are not what they were. Acknowledging the role a weight problem may have played in the seriousness of his illness, Mr Johnson is expected to unveil a “more interventionist” strategy on obesity by the end of the month. As well as measures to promote a healthy diet, a government campaign to encourage higher levels of exercise is being mooted. Joe Wicks, the lockdown hero of home workouts, visited Downing Street last week to discuss plans for the national fitness drive.From a prime minister who only a year ago described a levy on sugary drinks as a “sin stealth tax”, this is a welcome change of tone and focus. But it would be unwise to expect much substance behind the rhetoric. A ban on supermarket promotions of unhealthy products seems likely. But Mr Johnson apparently remains reluctant to introduce a 9pm watershed for the advertising of junk food, and has reportedly ruled out any additional levies.He should think again and do far more. A recent Public Health England report found that child obesity continues to rise among disadvantaged people at an alarming rate, while evidence of the role of advertising in encouraging unhealthy eating among the young is overwhelming. A genuine commitment to increasing levels of public exercise and fitness will also require more than high-profile input from Mr Wicks. From 25 July, gyms and public leisure centres will be allowed to reopen with physical distancing restrictions. But the crisis in local government finances is such that many will remain closed. An estimated 2,800 public leisure centres may fold by Christmas, most of them in deprived areas. One in 10 community swimming pools will not be able to open this month.For obvious reasons, staying healthy is currently at the forefront of most people’s minds. There has rarely been a better time to launch and fund a proactive public health policy to influence diet and promote exercise. The prime minister should seize the moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76c93dfe167dd751ba4df26824f345714e9e0c8/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5329dd3faaa5f7e71756577915697a58","title":"the guardian view on labour and pr fix a flawed system","story":"When running to be Labour leader, Keir Starmer pledged a constitutional convention and to look at reform of the voting system. He should keep his promiseBritain is the only major country in Europe where parliamentary seats won at a general election are not shared out between the parties in a proportional manner. Any vote not used to win a seat is, in effect, wasted. “First past the post” does offer ideological clarity and accountability. But this is at the expense of representation. All this contributes to the cynicism and disaffection felt for politics, and a dangerous sense that British voters have too little sway over those who govern them.Brexit was built on such discontents and there is widespread agreement that, in the future, power ought to be redistributed more fairly. The question is less what to do than how to do it. To build a better society we need a better politics. The present electoral system shows no sign of delivering this. Instead it reinforces a Labour-Tory duopoly, shuts out smaller parties and rewards nationalist ones – because votes piled up in one area are easier to convert into seats than those that are thinly spread.When running to be Labour leader, Keir Starmer committed to a constitutional convention and to look at reform of the voting system. He was responding to the groundswell of support in the Labour membership for a more proportional way of electing MPs after December’s election defeat. However, Labour has long been ided on electoral reform. On Monday the party’s consultation about how to proceed with constitutional change will close, but it seems to have largely sidestepped the issue of the way votes translate into seats. Instead the consultation focused on how federalism could counter the damage wrought by the centralising nature of the British state.Devolving power to the regions is an important and urgent issue. But Sir Keir should put electoral reform back on to the table. A proportional system of voting would unlock different institutions and cultures in British political life. It is true that less than a decade ago reformers lost a referendum on whether to change the voting system for British general elections. But governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are all elected on versions of proportional representation (PR). Even Labour’s national executive committee, which oversees party policy, will hold elections using a form of PR.Political parties that win power may be reluctant to change the voting system to which they owe their success. However, British democracy will not be repaired until the voting system is made genuinely more proportional. Mr Johnson did set up a “constitution, democracy and rights” commission that could have examined electoral shortcomings. But it seems designed, unfortunately, to avenge the slights Brexiters think they suffered at the hands of a remain establishment. It has also disappeared from view. For Labour the modernising years of 1997 until 2010 remain unfinished business. Sir Keir may wish to wait and see where the government is going before making his move. But without some sort of electoral reform that engages the public, the pressure to mend a broken system may blow up politics once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1201a88fa6fe7a59d2aaff1bd0c3d162f1a84305/39_0_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6ff2c90c3af75eff62b1244e35169cac","title":"lily cole fashion activist environment climate change interview we need to be more forgiving","story":"Supermodel, Cambridge graduate, activist – Lily Cole has many strings to her bow. Now she’s written a book that tackles our most urgent challengeI am tramping through the long grass of a Sussex nature reserve with supermodel-turned-activist Lily Cole. Beyond the gorse and the bracken, a vast open sky stretches before us. It certainly beats a sterile Zoom call. “How amazing is this?” she says. “I’ve been talking about moving to nature for years and then, finally, I decided to do it two years ago. I’ve been very grateful for it in general and particularly, obviously, these last few months.”Cole, 32, has just rocked up on a big beast of an e-bike. Of course she is on a bike, though she could have as easily been driving her fancy electric Tesla car. The Tesla tech whiz Elon Musk is just one of the so-called “Wizards” she has interviewed for her book, Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World. The Wizards are the people who are using technology in an attempt to innovate us out of the environmental crisis. In the other camp are the “Prophets” who say we must cut back, travel less, consume less, simplify. Cole examines both approaches in the book.Today Cole is in full Prophet mode in her “old, well-loved boots”, with her trademark flame-red hair tied in a top knot, but shaved underneath – an extremely beautiful hippie Prophet, dressed for comfort in jeans in a Conscious Exclusive bamboo fabric, T-shirt and cool round Wires sunglasses, a sustainable business she is involved with.As for many of us, her lockdown has been an “emotional roller coaster” but she daren’t whinge: “I feel like we’re in such a privileged position here. I can’t complain.” She has been “baking a ton, gardening a ton”, making nut milks, doing yoga, enjoying slowing down and spending more time with her five-year-old daughter, Wylde. So far, so hashtag blessed, and it would be easy to peg Cole as a virtue-signalling, silver-spooned bluestocking, but that would be to do her an injustice. Yes, her Uncle Adam was heir to a seat at the House of Lords (he turned it down to become a cinematographer, then a pioneer in sustainable energy), but Cole’s own upbringing was more frugal than gilded. She was born in Devon to a fisherman father and a mother who is an artist and writer her parents split when she was seven weeks old. Cole was raised in London by her mother, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and was frequently unable to work. Her grandparents owned a farm in South Wales.Cole was scouted outside a Soho burger bar by Storm Models when she was 14, and modelling was a dream ticket for her. In no time she was pulling sickies from school to work with the world’s most prestigious brands – Alexander McQueen, Louis Vuitton and Chanel to name but a few – and appearing on Vogue covers internationally.But pretty soon she was grappling with the darker side of consumerism’s lurking complexities. At 15 she was (uncomfortably) wearing fur on the catwalk. By 17 she had found her voice. “Eventually saying no to fur cost me work, but it was a fairly straightforward choice to make: little boxes on contracts, usually appearing next to ‘No Nudity’”. A more complex decision came when she found herself caught up with the jewellery company De Beers, which had been accused of evicting the San people to mine diamonds in Botswana. The company denied any wrongdoing, but in a bold move for one so young, Cole refused to work for them and instead helped the San sell their own fair trade jewellery.“This experience in Botswana marked me. I felt an enormous responsibility to understand and respect what I was selling. I wasn’t just buying the companies’ products, I was asking other people to buy them too,” she writes.It’s telling that we still know Cole as a supermodel. Though she rarely models these days, her distinctive face and bright auburn hair are what we remember, yet modelling was only ever part of her story, a sideline, first to her academic life – she has a double first in history of art from Cambridge and got straights As in her A-levels – then to her entrepreneurial ventures and acting.Her first role was in the 2007 remake of St Trinian’s, followed by Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus, and in 2017 she played the Virgin Queen in Channel 5’s Elizabeth I. She has also stepped behind the camera to make a film about the plight of the refugees on the island of Samos, and has lent her time and profile to numerous charities and social enterprises.“I’ve been quite lucky in that modelling is something you can do part-time, but ironically it’s the most visible part of my life, even though I spend less time doing it, because it only takes a few seconds to take a photo that’s then very visible and always there, in comparison, say, to the many months I might spend slogging behind a computer.”In her latest incarnation as a writer, Cole spends the morning working and afternoons with her daughter. There has been no rigorous home-schooling. Cole is a fan of “the Scandinavian approach” and “preserving the sanctity of childhood” until the age of seven. Of course she is. But still she has been “finding ways to slip in lessons”, writing in a more playful way by making postcards for people and reading Philip Pullman’s Northern Lights.In her book, Cole takes a deep e into the issues surrounding gender equality and the environment. She mentions that when she was pregnant she wrote a Post-it Note contract, which was “part in jest (but in spirit very serious!)” agreeing to split the childcare 5050 with her partner, tech-entrepreneur Kwame Ferreira. The “contract” with Ferreira was prompted by an article she read that said most couples never discuss the ision of childcare before their baby’s arrival. “It really rang out to me,” she says. So how is that working? Do they have a timetable? Does her partner stick to it? “I think it works really well – I’d highly recommend it. I’m not saying everyone has to make that choice or do the same ision we decided on,” she says. “It’s not a rigid thing, more a loose understanding that we try to honour.”Then, in a typically cerebral response, Cole spends a good five minutes explaining the philosophy behind this choice. “I’m not saying I’m against, in any form, women taking time out to look after their children if that’s what they want to do it’s a beautiful decision to make. The point I’m making is, I think ideas about who is responsible for the children have a big impact on gender parity for women. I’m not saying there’s a ‘right’ way to do it I’m encouraging parents to be conscious of what they want, rather than slipping into what their parents did. Or what their grandparents did.” She also mentions that she supports single motherhood and same-sex parenting. “Sorry – long answer,” she says. “But it’s important, right?”As we tramp through the long grass, passing the odd dog walker, Cole nods hello. This is the other part of the countryside equation that she appreciates. But does she miss London at all? “I like being able to access it, but I don’t miss the daily experience. I feel like all my defences are up: it’s so urban and busy, and no one says hello. It’s a little bit more human here.”Last year, Cole signed a letter in support of Extinction Rebellion, with other celebrities such as Jude Law, Jaime Winstone and Daisy Lowe, who work in fashion and film, jetsetting industries with huge carbon footprints – but Cole won’t be drawn into finger-wagging. The sensible answer would be to make the rich pay for their oversized carbon footprints, with a pollution tax on flights, as suggested by the campaign A Free Ride, she says. We could each have just one tax-free return flight a year.Cole tries hard not to fly herself, “but without saying I’ll never fly again” because it’s more difficult to travel ethically than you think. After hearing Greta Thunberg speak in Stockholm, she attempted to come home by train. “But that route isn’t really designed for that. I fucked it up.” After two days, four train rides, a bus ride, a ferry crossing and a night sleeping in Copenhagen, she missed her last connection. In the end she booked a (very cheap) flight, offsetting it on Climeworks, and cried in frustration because she felt like a failure – but also because it seemed indicative of a wider problem. She had more luck travelling to Portugal on a bumpy, old-fashioned, 1980s sleeper train, which delighted her daughter with its fold-down beds and grey felt walls. “It was awesome, so much more memorable than travelling by plane.”This is all very right-on of course, but Cole is able to laugh at herself (and frequently does). She is well aware of her privileged position.Fearing criticism, she questioned whether she should even write the book at all. “I’m definitely not perfect, but then no one is,” she admits. “I think that’s a natural instinct that comes from a society that is quite tough on each other. But being tough does nothing but distract from the conversation and the effort. So you have to resist that. It would be nice if we were a bit more forgiving as a culture,” she says. She is now embracing the idea of being “an imperfect environmentalist”.Cole’s first exposure to activism came at the age of eight, when her 16-year-old cousin, Emma, was photographed chained to a tree in newspapers. “I was, like, why is my cousin tied to a tree?” Emma has since said that she thinks this approach alienated people, that people looked at activists chained to trees and thought: “I’m not like that, so the environment isn’t something I need to care about.” Does Cole agree? “I can really understand what she was saying because you don’t want to create an ‘us’ and ‘them’ mentality. The reality we’re dealing with should make everyone an environmentalist. It’s something that concerns us all in the same way as Covid is something that concerns us all: the environment is similarly real. It’s really important to keep listening and to stay open-minded, because we’re all in this together, no one has the right answers. No one knows what’s right.”What law would she introduce if she were prime minister for the day? “From an environmental point of view? Put a price on pollution.” A similar tax caused uproar in France, when fuel tax riots engulfed Paris in 2018. “But the devil is in the detail right? They didn’t design it in the right way, so it impacted ordinary people financially. But there are examples, like Canada, where it’s well designed and doesn’t penalise poorer communities, and can even offer wealth redistribution, with the tax redistributed equally among citizens, so the less you pollute the more you make.”The ink was just drying on her book when Covid-19 hit. She has spent part of lockdown rewriting the preface, but does she think we will take this chance to finally pivot, to let nature bounce back? “We’ve yet to see what will happen with Covid. Whether it will be a distraction, because we’re focused on a new set of problems or whether it will compound it. I hope it compounds it because we’ve already started experiencing some of the things scientists have been warning about for years.” Like the bushfires? “Yes and Covid itself is a result of the way we’re interacting with the natural world, the way we’re industrialising animal agriculture – and that’s not a conversation that’s in the mainstream.”On her bleakest days Cole says she soothes herself with the thought that if we don’t get our climate sorted the Earth will carry on regardless. “What’s the worst-case scenario? Just that we’re going to wipe ourselves out, along with other species, but the world will no doubt bounce back and there might even be more interesting creatures that emerge instead of us.”Unless you live in an entirely self-sufficient way, everything we touch, eat and use is connected to a complex web of trade relationships that we are responsible for being part of. When we make a purchase, we are explicitly supporting that way of doing business by giving a company our money we are funding them keeping going.Of course, the power of money lies not just in how you spend it, but also in how you earn it, save it and invest it. Many of us want to earn more money working for – or setting up – companies that are looking to solve problems. Employees often have the greatest leverage to change the working practices inside companies, and there has been a boom in social businesses and new legal structures that seek to remodel a new vision of capitalism. My journey in thinking about these issues began when I was plunged head first into the epicentre of consumerism: fashion.I was always a fairly material girl: I remember trawling Portobello Market from a very young age, begging my mum to buy me a trinket. I had a penchant for dressing up, and second-hand clothes were my palette. Mum’s answer was usually no, met by hysteria. But sometimes she would give in and buy it.Then a store opened in Kilburn selling new clothes at unbelievably cheap prices: T-shirts for £1, dresses for £3. I saved my Christmas money and would fill up one of their big baskets until it was so heavy I could barely lift it. I never considered how clothes could be made so cheaply. It was as if they had dropped from heaven.And one day, my life changed. I was walking in Soho with friends when a man approached us, holding a little white card and said something about modelling. I pocketed the card and let my heart spring under a cautious face.My mum took me into the modelling agency the first time. I was given a big blue book, which would be filled with pictures of me: I was to become my own travelling saleswoman. I had just turned 14 and the blue book was heavy with possibilities.Fashion offered a fairytale for my inner child, and initially I indulged it without question. I made money and friends, and fulfilled my dream of travelling. Yet it also offered me a surprising gift: an education in capitalism.Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World by Lily Cole (Penguin Life , £20) is out on 30 July.

It proudly commemorates: “100 years of innovation in supplying the UK with transportation fuels and important base chemicals.”A sense of pride in Saltend’s past is understandable: places like this helped drive Britain’s industrial age. But the biggest, most dramatic innovation of all may be yet to come. This month, the Norwegian energy company, Equinor, (formerly Statoil), unveiled proposals to install the biggest facility in the world for making hydrogen from natural gas, using capture and storage technology to extract and bury the resulting carbon under the North Sea.The Humber region is currently the biggest emitter of carbon in Britain and the second-highest emitter in Europe. Equinor’s plan, if it goes ahead, would amount to a green revolution at Saltend, allowing businesses on the site to convert to clean energy. And if the rest of the region follows suit, by 2030 this windblown stretch of North Sea coastline could conceivably be one of the world’s leading green energy hubs.“This is a plan,” suggests Al Cook, the head of Equinor’s English operations, “which would help transform the UK’s largest industrial cluster into its greenest cluster. We are one of the largest energy producers in the world. Saltend is one of the oldest industrial hubs of its kind. Humberside has all the natural resources required on its doorstep. It is a chance for the UK to get on the front foot in the green energy race.”Get ready for Britain’s hydrogen boom? Definitely maybe.Hydrogen has been the next big thing for longer than its advocates would care to remember. Before Elon Musk, Tesla and electric battery technology, it was commonly assumed that we might all, one day, be driving hydrogen cars. The traditional drawback for investors has been the expensive complexity of actually producing the stuff. But in an era of net zero carbon emissions targets, the green utility of the most common chemical element in the universe is turning it into one of the most fashionable products on earth.“Blue” hydrogen – the kind Equinor hopes to produce in Hull – can be made almost carbon-free from natural gas, by using the capture and storage technology. For groups such as Friends of the Earth, “almost” is not good enough, and the enormous cost of capture and storage has also generated scepticism.Green hydrogen, on the other hand, which is made from renewable sources, bypasses fossil fuels altogether. Both types can be stored and kept in reserve, to be deployed as an inter-seasonal fuel supplementing wind and solar power. Hydrogen, its supporters claim, can also heat homes and workplaces, distributed through the existing infrastructure of the National Grid. It can be used to de-carbonise trains and buses and provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, for which electric-battery technology is impractical. In synthetic form, hydrogen could even help fly zero-carbon planes.All of which led the European Union’s green deal supremo, Frans Timmermans, to tweet this month: “Hydrogen rocks, and I am committed to making it a success.”Presenting an EU strategy aimed at producing 10 million tonnes of H2 by 2030, Timmermans said: “The new hydrogen economy can be a growth engine to help overcome the economic damage caused by Covid-19.” Germany has announced a massive £9bn investment plan. Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs and energy, explained the logic: “In adopting the hydrogen strategy, we are paving the way for Germany to become the world leader in the field of hydrogen technologies.”In Britain’s energy sector, as other countries invest in the hope of a virtuous cycle of green growth, there is a growing nervousness. Having led the way in early wind farm technology, the UK failed to capitalise and become a major manufacturer and exporter. In the electric car industry, it has fallen far behind Germany and other competitors after failing to invest enough in battery production capacity. Equinor has made it clear that it will only proceed with its blue hydrogen plans for Hull if the government plays its part, sharing the risks of investing in a fledgling industry. “All our experience,” says Cook, “tells us that in projects of this scale and ambition, it only works when governments and companies work together. We will need clear frameworks and assurances and a commitment to investment from London.”Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, is the deputy chair of the Committee on Climate Change, and one of the country’s most influential backers of hydrogen. She believes that if Britain acts decisively now, it can take a giant step towards meeting the legal requirement for net zero emissions by 2050 and become a world leader in a lucrative new market. “It is urgent for the UK to get on with this,” said King. “In terms of hydrogen technology, we have a very strong position at the moment. In electrolysis, in storage technology and other areas, we have really dynamic companies which we need to help grow.”Britain also enjoys a natural advantage, she points out: the winds that blow in from the North Sea and can be turned into green hydrogen. “This country has the best offshore wind resource in Europe. We have all the ingredients to make this an industry which the UK is really successful at one which will reduce our emissions and which will provide real export opportunities for cutting-edge technologies.“We could also be selling into a huge export market for hydrogen. We could even get to the position of being sellers of electrolytic hydrogen to Germany.”None of this is likely to happen, though, without significant government intervention, both to lend confidence and to help shape an industry which, at the moment, barely exists. “The challenge is that we’ve actually got to create both supply and demand,” says King. “There’s no point in producing hydrogen unless you have a way of using it. And there’s no point in developing buses, trains and so on unless somebody is going to be able to supply hydrogen to you.“We need the government to form something like a hydrogen industry council to bring the demand and supply side players together to discuss how to start the industry.And, obviously, it would be helpful to know that there would be money available. When I was on the board of the green investment bank, one of the things we saw was the confidence that government gave when it came to investing in early offshore wind. Having government as the lead investor brings in other investors.”Conservative governments are generally averse to a hands-on approach to industrial strategy. With hydrogen, it might be different. Potentially, this is a red wall success story in the making. As King points out: “A successful hydrogen strategy would not be about jobs in Oxford, Cambridge and London. It would be about developing the regions where we bring energy from wind onshore about places like Hull and Grimsby and all the other places along the coast that have had a really rough time and are in desperate need of an uplift.”After Equinor unveiled its proposals for Saltend, the headline in the Hull Daily Mail read: “Humber hydrogen plant could create 5,000 jobs.” Further up the north-east coast, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, has led a successful bid for a £1.3m grant to build refuelling stations for hydrogen vehicles. Following last December’s unprecedented string of victories in Labour strongholds, Conservative MPs are now installed in five of the eight seats in the Tees Valley. Houchen has called for the region to be turned into a UK hydrogen powerhouse.The new network of influence is making its presence felt in parliament. One of the refuelling stations will be in Redcar, a seat won for the first time for the Conservatives last December by Jacob Young. Young is the chair of the cross-party MPs working group on hydrogen which was set up in 2018. Alexander Stafford, the MP for Rother Valley – where the Battle of Orgreave took place during the miners’ strike – is another hydrogen advocate.“It would be a great thing,” said Stafford, who sits on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, “if the areas which played such a big part in energy production in the industrial age could now play a new role in producing the energy of the future.”In its latest report, the group calls for the government to urgently set out a national hydrogen strategy, “or risk falling behind”. Given the huge lead enjoyed by countries such as Germany and Japan in electric battery production, says Stafford, “if you are looking to invest, it is far better to look in the direction of hydrogen than at batteries. The whole world is heading towards becoming carbon neutral, with some countries moving quicker than others. So the question is, how can the UK get on the front foot with hydrogen? If it can do so, there will be enormous idends.”According to King, positive signals have come from the minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng. King is hopeful that a strategy will be unveiled before parliament goes into recess at the end of July. “There’s much more agreement now about where hydrogen will play a role,” she says. “In the past, it started out mainly being about light-duty vehicles. It is understood now that hydrogen is about trains, buses, industrial processes and so on.”In places like Hull, the green future can’t come soon enough. A few days after Equinor made its pitch on Saltend, a Social Market Foundation study placed the city at the top of the list of places that will find it hardest to bounce back from the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Mike Ross, now a Lib Dem councillor, came to the city 20 years ago as a student. He has banged the drum for green investment in Hull for years. “We became the forgotten city of the floods in 2007. Then there was the crash, and then 10 years of austerity which hit places like this hardest. After Covid, there must be a special effort. This city must not be forgotten about again.”If Hull really does become a vanguard city in a hydrogen revolution, it won’t be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18c439df814e383a9ea08ea786ab0846450ae54/0_212_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29386b81db70c7cfbef9410c06f28640","title":"carbon savings from covid 19 lockdown halve within weeks","story":"Greenhouse gas emissions from energy and transport sectors climb as more people return to workThe UK’s carbon emissions have begun to rebound following the easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures, causing the “carbon savings” triggered by the coronavirus to halve within weeks.Greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and transport industries climbed last month as more people returned to work, raising demand for fossil fuels from record lows in April when strict lockdown measures were in place, according to new data.Chloé Depigny, a senior manager at Sia Partners, said the data underlines the fragility of the UK’s short-term carbon savings during the coronavirus, and the need for ambitious fundamental changes to the economy if the government hopes to meet its long-term carbon targets.“However, from a climate point of view if this only occurs in 2020 and normal emissions return in 2021 then these savings will mean only a very small dent to emissions in the end. We saw this in the 2008 financial crisis emissions very quickly returned to pre-crisis levels,” she added.One of the greatest threats to the UK’s carbon savings this year is a surge in demand for road travel as more people opt to use passenger vehicles over public transport to avoid contact with the coronavirus.Another threat to carbon reductions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is the number of people who may continue to work from home during the winter months.“We have been lucky that lockdown has happened during warm summer months. If there was a second lockdown during the winter, homes would rely on gas-heating to keep their homes warm all day, which would produce far more emissions than during the summer. It would probably counter most of the savings from less commuting,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b3114bdcc0bf355eded9de4941ea7b3309ead0/0_354_5371_3223/master/5371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bcd47981f00aafa8c1a3cfb9caefdbc","title":"at last going out for lunch at picque nique a french place really worth the wait","story":"Pique-Nique is impeccably Gallic – it’s a thrill to finally be able to eat herePique-Nique, Tanner Street Park, London SE1 3LD (020 7403 9549). Small plates £6.50-£10.50, large sharing dishes £42-£68, desserts £6.50-£7.50, wines from £18A bright summer’s day, 36 hours after the easing of lockdown, and I am seated at a wide, socially distanced marble-topped counter. Two plates of food are pushed towards me. One holds tomatoes in brilliant reds, yellows and purples dressed with snowy white feta, shiny black olives and fat caper berries on their stalks, like musical notes in search of a stave. The other is a slice of pâté en croûte, the chubby pink of the pork studded with the brilliant green of pistachio and all of it framed by the Ford Granada walnut trim of glazed pastry work.Look at these plates of loveliness. I am thrilled to be here at Pique-Nique, in a low-slung building tucked into the corner of a small sports ground in Bermondsey, south London. It’s not simply that restaurants have been able to reopen after more than 100 days. It’s that, in the past day and a half, not every eating adventure has worked out quite as well.My first restaurant meal, chasing news deadlines, had been at Trullo, a neighbourhood Italian at Highbury Corner in north London. I was the first customer through the door on the day of reopening – and it was delightful. The second, later that evening, not so much. In early June a flashy London restaurant dropped a marketing email, inviting me to book for 4 July. I rewarded their bravado by booking for this week’s column. And so that Saturday night off I went, my heart full of unalloyed optimism.It was various kinds of awful: underportioned servings of overengineered food at ludicrous prices, and wines by the glass measured out as if they were trying to get nine pours out of each bottle. As dinner trundled on, my heart fell to meet my knees. Oh God. I had recently tweeted that, for the foreseeable future, I wouldn’t be publishing negative reviews. If I went somewhere dismal, I would merely chalk it up to experience and move on. And now I was somewhere dismal.My tweet hadn’t struck me as particularly controversial. God knows the restaurant business has been through enough. It didn’t need me going all Inigo Montoya from The Princess Bride on failing places, as someone once put it. Some argued I would be failing in my duty as a ruthless, blood-smeared critic if I didn’t point out the bad as well as the good. Except there are literally thousands of dreadful restaurants I’ve never told you about. Still, on what must have been a slow news day, this proclamation of mine became an item on BBC2’s Newsnight (in which I didn’t participate because, while I’m not unfamiliar with grandiose gestures, there are limits). It was portrayed as an outbreak of kindness. But really, would you have wanted today’s column to be nine thick gallons of unplugged bile?I had to find somewhere else. Which is why I ended up, 16 hours later, amid the kitsch mock-Tudor beams of this converted changing block. Back in the day malicious teenage boys doubtless whipped each other with wet coiled towels in here, for grim laughs. Now people like me perch on bar stools, or lounge on the terrace by the tennis courts, shovelling away plates of cracking ingredients treated with respect.The space was converted in 2017 by the team behind Casse-Croûte just around the corner, and is so impeccably French, they even have a collection of those garishly coloured ceramic Gallic roosters that would look ludicrous anywhere other than on a marble-top bar like this, as a mark of revolutionary fervour. Not that the food is pushing boundaries. There are cheery sharing dishes cooked on the rotisserie at chunky prices, though each is for two to three people and comes with sides: a whole black leg chicken with roast potatoes and green salad for £42 a lamb shoulder with aubergine caviar, runner beans and jus for £58.We opted instead for all the smaller plates, priced at between £6.50 and £10.50: those tomatoes, dribbled with glugs of peppery olive oil, that classic pâté en croûte, topped by its fat ribbon of savoury jelly the colour of amber, with pickles to cut through it all. There were artichokes “à la grecque”, simmered in a peppercorn-spiked liquor of white wine, olive oil and lemon juice with nutty beans dressed in a coriander pesto. Razor clams were cooked, chopped and returned to their shell with wild mushrooms and spinach, then doused in a reduced liquor of spinach and garlic, the better to be swiped away with chunks of baguette. The nearest thing to exotica was a carpaccio of salt-cured cod, with blackberries and fragments of seeded cracker.We finished with a raspberry mille-feuille, with raspberry sorbet made with the crispest of caramelised pastry, and the finest of fruit. It was so pretty it seemed a shame to put a spoon through it, though not for long. Roasted apricots with apricot ice-cream and ricotta came with granola which didn’t quite convince me that breakfast cereal belongs with lunch. See? It’s still possible to be positive and critical.You will want to know what eating here is like. Tables have been removed to enforce the necessary social distancing and that bar really is hefty, making well-spaced counter dining an option. All waiters wear masks, and there’s no paper because both the food menu and the short wine list are on blackboards. In good weather there is that space outside. It has been thought through.Some suggest that the reopening of restaurants is too risky that the low paid will be forced to work against their will. There will always be terrible employers, just as there were before Covid-19. But everyone I’ve spoken to so far has expressed enthusiasm about returning to work. In the end it comes down to a risk assessment and, even as a 50-plus male carrying enough extra timber to make a Viking long boat, the risk – both to myself and to others – seems reasonable. There is a balance to be struck between the health impacts of the virus and those of lockdown. Right now, that balance leans towards restaurants being open, though it may change. I want the restaurant sector to survive. That means going to them. For now, that’s what I shall do. I’ll keep my fingers crossed they’re all as comely as Pique-Nique.The charity Hospitality Action has launched an innovative ‘invisible chips’ campaign to raise funds for people in the restaurant business, suffering financially because of the current crisis. The campaign, fronted by Fred Sirieix, Heston Blumenthal and Tom Kerridge, invites diners to add a portion of fat-free, calorie-free, non-existent chips to their order, with all proceeds going to the charity. BrewDog is among the first companies to sign up, putting invisible chips on their menu at £3.95. Those who are not yet going out to eat but wish to contribute, and restaurants who want to sign up to the campaign, can do so at invisiblechips.org.uk.For the same price you can get the Summertime Picnic Pack from the Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company. Each pack contains a hunk of their cave-matured traditional cheddar, another flavoured with cider, garlic and chives, plus Cornish sea salt biscuits, cheese straws, red onion marmalade and chilli jam. For sake of doubt you do not need to go on a picnic to eat this. You can also eat it at home.

The Tykes are now off the bottom, but will still need to beat Brentford on Wednesday and hope other results go their way.Forest are without a victory in five games and need a point at home to Stoke in their last game to make sure of a play-off place – although their superior goal difference means they are unlikely to miss out.Barnsley were dominant from the start in a game they needed to win and both Alex Mowatt and Luke Thomas went close in the opening minutes, setting the pattern to the afternoon’s proceedings, Thomas later clipping the crossbar on the half-hour mark.Forest’s first chance fell to Lewis Grabban who dragged his shot wide, before Jordan Smith in the Forest goal made a comfortable save to keep out Marcel Ritzmaier’s long-range effort.Conor Chaplin then looked to capitalise on a mix-up in the Forest defence, but he fired wide from a tight angle. Barnsley’s Callum Styles beat a couple of players before firing in a shot from the edge of the area which went wide of Smith’s right-hand post.Forest had a chance to force the breakthrough goal in the latter stages of the half when Tiago Silva’s low cross was met by Nuno Da Costa who flicked the ball goalwards, but the goalkeeper Jack Walton managed to get down smartly and keep it out.Jacob Brown was put through by Chaplin just before the interval, but he struggled to get the ball under control and that allowed Smith to clear the danger.Barnsley’s head coach, Gerhard Struber, sent on the 15-goal striker Cauley Woodrow in place of Kilian Ludewig at the start of the second half, and the substitute was soon involved in the action, firing in a shot which was deflected wide.Forest’s manager, Sabri Lamouchi, made a double substitution 10 minutes after the restart, sending on Sammy Ameobi and Ryan Yates but it was Barnsley again who went close when Ritzmaier’s deflected long-range effort struck a post before Jordan Williams tried his luck from distance, with the ball clearing the bar.They threatened again when an effort from the substitute Matty Wolfe was cleared off the line by Joe Worrall. With less than 10 minutes remaining, Schmidt replaced Ritzmaier. The home side threw men forward in the closing stages and Schmidt snatched the winner deep into stoppage time to keep hope alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77ed6e9ae60aebaea67cf3234b9d49cd2b91b647/0_96_1578_946/master/1578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85313c312cb3adcb0b217c92f266ab1d","title":"bournemouth southampton premier league match report","story":"As the second goal went in, a despairing Eddie Howe shut his eyes and shook his head, as any grains of belief eventually evaporated in second-half stoppage time. When the final whistle arrived, the Bournemouth goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale slumped against one of his posts before staring ahead as the pitch slowly emptied.These are bleak snapshots of a season that has all but slipped away from Bournemouth and, with a game to go, they are left praying for miracles and for Watford, the only team they can still suck into the relegation zone, to drop not just points but for their goal difference to take a hammering, too.A painfully familiar face paved the way to victory for a clinical and unforgiving Southampton, with Danny Ings kickstarting the scoring by bending a delicious effort into the far corner after wriggling free of Jack Stacey. Ings’s celebrations were muted for good reason, given it was here he started his career after being released by Southampton at the age of 16. A couple of years later, Howe gave him his professional debut before re‑signing him at Burnley and the gloss on the finish was typically effervescent as he sent a rasping strike into the net to take his tally to 21 goals for the season. How Ings has flourished since returning to his boyhood club.Ings is not infallible, though, and had a second-half penalty saved when Ramsdale ed down to his left to smother the spot-kick. Ings hesitated in his run-up and, unusually, failed to strike the ball with any conviction. For Ralph Hasenhüttl, who could afford a wry smile while discussing Ings’s miss, it was another fine performance, a gargantuan defensive showing.It is not over until is over, Howe said valiantly afterwards, but the mental scars of Che Adams doubling Southampton’s advantage moments after they thought they had found a lifeline in stoppage time will surely be lasting. The substitute Sam Surridge squeezed home from close range but the goal was disallowed after David Coote, the video assistant referee, ruled Callum Wilson offside in the buildup. If that was a cruel blow, when Adams lashed in after Bournemouth went for broke in search of another opening, they were visibly shattered.“I’m deeply disappointed hurt loads of different emotions are going through my body,” Howe said. “The key thing is while there is still hope we have to believe, until such time it is mathematically not possible. You never know in football, crazy things happen. But I’m very disappointed because a big chunk of our destiny and our future was in our hands today, but it’s slipped away a little bit. It was a very emotional game in many ways.”Unlike in meek defeats to Crystal Palace and Newcastle since the restart, Bournemouth’s desire to turn around their slide could not be questioned. “Get it on the ground, come on,” Hasenhüttl roared on the sideline, incensed at Southampton’s inability to stem the flow of Bournemouth attacks.Diego Rico’s inviting cross bounced in the six-yard box, Callum Wilson headed over unmarked and Lloyd Kelly swivelled on the edge of the D before sending a shot wide, then Kyle Walker-Peters made a magnificent interception with Junior Stanislas lurking. But that Ramsdale, arguably Bournemouth’s player of the season, was kept the busier keeper sums up where things unravelled, Bournemouth having created a flurry of openings without finding the final piece of the jigsaw.Ramsdale twice saved superbly from Redmond but, as they pushed for an equaliser, Southampton were able to feast on holes in defence, with Adams blasting in to compound the home side’s misery. Harry Wilson forced a fingertip save from Alex McCarthy in the Southampton goal and Jannik Vestergaard made a brilliant block to deny Dominic Solanke a dream leveller off the bench, but Bournemouth failed to register a lasting imprint. If Watford avoid defeat at Manchester City on Tuesday, Howe’s side will be relegated.Howe conceded his team have become “a bit snatchy” in front of goal and, ultimately, they squandered the final chance to wrest things back in their favour. “It’s hard to understand why they are where they are at the moment,” said Hasenhüttl. “We have had tough games against them. They have quality in every position and they are very organised. But this is the Premier League.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eb1e7d520be01f80bf8c5d7208e1547c367986a/0_53_2100_1261/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53205f3bfecacd54be4dac7ab7f93dbe","title":"tottenham leicester premier league match report","story":"Tottenham might not have everything they want, but they are making big enough strides with what they have got. Their fourth win in five games came in a curious encounter whose overwhelming majority was played in their half, José Mourinho’s team absorbing pressure with fluctuating levels of comfort before taking Leicester apart three times in the first 40 minutes.Harry Kane was outstanding, scoring twice and playing a major part in the James Justin own goal that set them off, but Mourinho would be justified in framing the afternoon as a triumph of planning. Spurs do not always make smooth watching but they purred when given the invitation and struck brutally at the heart of Leicester’s frailties it should now prove good enough for a Europa League spot and, from where they were, that may count as a season redeemed.This may yet become a campaign squandered for Leicester, who are now likely to find themselves behind Manchester United when they contest what is in effect a Champions League play-off next Sunday. They retain control of their destiny but this blow to their goals-conceded column may prove costly, and a repeat of the brittleness shown here will surely be punished anew.To anyone uninitiated with the nature of Spurs’ recent upturn, it might have been thoroughly remarkable that they went in at half-time with the outcome virtually sealed. Leicester had threatened regularly but they could not point to a lack of prior information: the past week had seen Arsenal and Newcastle both dismissed despite outpassing Tottenham, and Mourinho was never going to seek all-out control against his latest opponents, who pop the ball around far better than most.It took only six minutes for his approach to bear fruit again. Leicester had begun to find some rhythm but were quickly picked off and, even if the opener owed plenty to fortune, its conception was scintillating. Kane’s pass to Son Heung-min, delivered with the outside of his right foot from 20 yards inside the Spurs half, was beautifully weighted down the left channel and made an elegant spectacle in conjunction with the Korean’s bent run.Son had Ryan Bennett for company as he cut inside and his shooting angle improved when the defender stumbled. With a fair wind the resulting effort may or may not have faded inside Kasper Schmeichel’s left post in the event, it clipped off the unfortunate Justin and flew the other way, rendering it unsavable. A VAR check ensued, with an offside Kane running across the box as Son let fly, but his intervention was deemed harmless.The second and third goals were, primarily, evidence of Kane’s enduring excellence. But they also formed a harsh lesson for George Thomas, the 19-year-old Leicester wing-back who is deputising for Ben Chilwell. Having performed superbly against Sheffield United, Thomas looked the part for long periods again here, distributing intelligently throughout and providing a genuine attacking menace with his left foot.But when a clearance from Youri Tielemans’ corner was aimed his way in the 37th minute, his loose touch put Tottenham in their element. They were still 80 yards from the Leicester goal but Giovani Lo Celso and Lucas Moura made light of the distance, eating up the space before the latter found Kane’s diagonal burst with a cute through ball. The finish, rolled left-footed across Schmeichel, was consummate.Thomas had discovered that when your opponents are this good, imprecision can cost you anywhere. That had barely sunk in when, near the touchline, he was dispossessed by Moura and Spurs were away again. This time Moura’s pass seemed to have taken Kane slightly wide but it did not matter: he had time to bring the ball back inside and, having done so, curved an exquisite right-foot strike into the far corner. All three goals had arisen from Spurs’ rapid transitions upon winning the ball deep in their own half.Before the second of them, Schmeichel had saved sharply from Son. But his opposite number was the busier as Leicester probed to offset Justin’s misfortune. Hugo Lloris blocked a backheel from Jamie Vardy and then, with a quite exceptional save, plunged low to repel Ayoze Pérez’s volley. Thomas had delivered the cross for that chance, and also laid on a sight of goal for Vardy that Toby Alderweireld charged down. Lloris tipped over another Pérez shot before the interval Leicester had been fairly good but, more pertinently, fatally naive.The game was up, although Kane’s quest for a hat-trick remained alive and it would have arrived early in the second period if Wes Morgan had not been alert. There was little change in the direction of play, just a softer sting to the action. Lloris, at his best here, acrobatically saved a free-kick from the substitute Demarai Gray and held on to a drive from Harvey Barnes.Leicester were now tied on plus-28 goal difference with United so it was in their long-term interests to at least reduce the deficit but, after one last Lloris stop from Kelechi Iheanacho, they were left with nothing bar a week to chew over their fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d37540ca28ac990c9c35cd296bd404a172b0bd96/0_308_6840_4104/master/6840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64799ae5cfe2dbe9b9c9dd90185a3f81","title":"manchester united v chelsea fa cup semi final live","story":"67 min Time for the drinks break. 65 min: Chance for United! Fernandes’ big, inswinging corner is headed just wide by Maguire. Caballero came for the ball and was nowhere near it, but the under-pressure Maguire couldn’t steer his header into the empty net.64 min Both players are okay to continue.63 min There’s another clash of heads, this time between Rudiger and Greenwood.62 min Chelsea are cruising. United are having more of the ball but there’s no conviction in their passing, and Chelsea look the likelier scorers on the break.61 min “All the discussion about depth and formation and such, while probably meaningful on the margins, overlooks the simple answer for the difference between the two teams today - Chelsea were given two extra days to rest and prepare for this match than United,” says Jonathan Francis.60 min “While I agree De Gea hasn’t been nowhere near as good for the last season as he was for a very long time, as a United fan it’s impossible to forget he was the one consistent beacon of light at Old Trafford in the age of Moyes, van Gaal and Mourinho,” says Sanchit Sabhlok. “If nothing else, Ole should maybe give him another season. He’s a 29-year-old goalkeeper for christ sake!” 58 min de Gea makes a good save, leaping to his left to slap Giroud’s deflected shot away from goal. Chelsea look very dangerous on the counter-attack.57 min Mount misses a decent chance, whipping a shot over the bar from 18 yards after excellent play by Willian and Giroud.56 min Fernandes plays the free-kick short to Wan-Bissaka. He crosses beyond the far post to Maguire, whose header is comfortably held by Caballero.55 min James is shoved over by Rudiger just outside the area on the right. Before the free-kick is taken, Pogba and Greenwood replace Fred and Daniel James.54 min Paul Pogba and Mason Greenwood are about to come on.54 min United are having their best spell of the game, though that’s mainly because Chelsea are now protecting a lead.53 min Fernandes sprays a brilliant long pass over the defence to Rashford, who shoots just wide of the far post from a tight angle. I’m not sure it would have counted anyway - I think the ball touched his arm as he controlled it. 51 min Mount’s low cross is miscontrolled at the near post by Giroud. Chelsea could run away with this.50 min “It’s been great watching United progress from constipated plodders to scything musketeers via the successful integration, or reboot, of Fernandes, Maguire, Wan Bissaka, Greenwood, Martial, Shaw and Pogba of late,” says Patrick Treacy. “But realistically I feel they are a distance behind Chelsea, who may not have as good a first XI, but have stronger and more suitable options on their bench, have bought well and early for next year and have room for improvement via a tactical upgrade. I think three players is the minimum United will need to reassert themselves as a force - more like two summer transfer windows imho.”I don’t think either team have a chance of challenging Liverpool for the title next season. I agree about Chelsea’s depth, though United have the better starting XI for mine.49 min I’d imagine we’ll see Mason Greenwood and Paul Pogba very soon.48 min “Like I said earlier...the formation was wrong, far too negative,” says Neil Carter. “Ironic really that Chelsea score after our best moments of the first half with Tony in the pitch. Greenwood to score the winner!”47 min I bet Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wishes he had stuck with his usual FA Cup keeper, Sergio Romero.That’s a dreadful mistake. Williams played a really loose square pass that was picked up by Mount, 35 yards from goal. He ran to the edge of the D and drove a routine low shot that somehow went through the fingers of the ing de Gea. This is definitely a howler from David de Gea - and from Brandon Williams.46 min Chelsea begin the second half. No news on Eric Bailly, who presumably has been taken to hospital.“Much has been said (by far cleverer people than me) about De Gea, but he’s a real conundrum,” says Matt Dony. “It wasn’t a case of him having a bit of a purple patch a few years ago. He was genuinely, inarguably one of the very best goalkeepers in the world. He seemed to pull off amazing saves regularly. During a period where United had the worst bunch of defenders they’d had for years, he made them respectable. It wasn’t even that long ago, was it? These days, he’s a liability. Ok, maybe that’s an exaggeration, he still makes some good saves, but the ball goes through him far, far too often. On balance, he’s now an adequate keeper. No more, no less. I don’t understand the change. I can’t think of many other sportspeople who have gone from being consistently so incredible for a few years to consistently so average for a few years. Does Ole stick or twist before next season? Surely he has to twist...”I don’t think I’ve ever seen a keeper with better reactions than de Gea, so I’d be loath to sell him unless I was nigh-on certain he was past his best. He’s 29, which is young for a keeper, but he also started as a teenager. My hunch is he’ll never get back to his 2012-18 level. But how can you be sure?“A quick look at Project Restart shows Man Utd having a game on average every 3.3 days,” says Ben O’Connell. “That’s not counting the possible final of the FA Cup or any Europa League games. That’s an incredible amount of game time in a short period of time after a gap longer than most off seasons with no preseason. Add to that a shallow squad and you’re likely to get decreasing standard of play.”“De Gea is not elite with the ball at his feet and never sweeps up,” says Digvijay Yadav. “His redeeming quality - pulling off ridiculous saves - has waned considerably. And now he’s on a massive wage. Oh well.”It’s hard to fathom, isn’t it? For four or five years he was astoundingly good. Maybe he never got over that slightly miserable 2018 World Cup.I can’t decide whether de Gea was at fault for the goal or not. Giroud was only six yards out so his reaction time was almost nonexistent, but having got a hand to the ball he probably should have saved it. I think he pushed it onto his leg and back over the line, in which case he was a little unlucky.Peep peep! That was a strange, subdued first half, but Chelsea were the better side and probably deserve to be ahead.Azpilicueta played a give and go with Willian down the right and curled a fast cross to the near post. Giroud got away from the sleepy Lindelof and flicked a neat shot with the outside of the left foot that went through de Gea and into the net. Olivier Giroud scores in the 56th minute!45+11 min Bruno Fernandes suddenly reverses a brilliant pass through the Chelsea defence, but the alert Caballero gets to the ball just before James.45+9 min We’re in the 54th minute of the first half. What day is this?45+8 min United appeal for a penalty when Martial goes down after a clumsy challenge from Zouma. VAR decides Mike Dean didn’t make a clear and obvious error. It was definitely a foul - Martial got to the bouncing ball first and Zouma booted his leg - but I reckon it was just outside the area, so maybe that’s why VAR didn’t intervene. 45+8 min Five minutes of added time were scheduled but I’d imagine it will 11 or 12.45+7 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Tim. “City unarguably have strength in depth up front and in midfield, but it’s fair to say they didn’t cope marvellously well with Laporte’s injury this season.”Yeah but wait until this summer, when they buy Koulibaly, Upamecano, Skriniar, Maldini, Beckenbauer and Baresi.45+6 min Bailly is being wheeled down the tunnel and play will resume.45+5 min Bailly is being moved very slowly onto a stretcher. The BBC commentator Steve Wilson said that Bailly had a delayed reaction to the clash of heads with Maguire, which is worrying. 45+3 min Bailly is now lying on his back near the touchline. He is in a neck brace and a stretcher is being prepared. Play has been stopped because Bailly is being treated right by the touchline.45+1 min Bailly is on his feet, but he’s clearly concussed and is going to come off. Martial replaces him, so I imagine United will switch to the usual 4-2-3-1: de Gea Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams Fred, Matic James, Fernandes, Rashford Martial.45 min While Maguire has his head bandaged, Anthony Martial is getting ready to come on for Eric Bailly.44 min Maguire is sitting up while his eye is stitched. He looks okay but Bailly is probably concussed he’s clashed heads twice in the space of three minutes.42 min Now Bailly has clashed heads with Maguire, who has a bit of blood coming from his right eye. Both players look very groggy. If United do have to make a change, they might take the opportunity to switch to a back four.41 min Zouma and Bailly are okay to continue.40 min “United resting Pogba, Martial and Greenwood has exposed the lack of quality in the squad,” says Stephen Carr. “Same with Liverpool if any of the front three are missing (and god forbid van Dijk gets injured). Only City have genuine strength in depth - a squad which we now know was assembled using only entirely legitimate means.”You say that about Liverpool, but one of the most astonishing things about that 4-0 win over Barcelona is that they were without Salah and Firmino for the whole game and Robertson for the second half. I agree that it’s not sustainable over a longer period though.39 min Mount’s deflected cross from the left is headed over by the ing Zouma at the near post. It was a half chance at most. Zouma and Bailly clashed heads as they ed for the ball, and both are still down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647ec876c5adc9f7357a5d4fa7c20d1e5e1c536d/0_155_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a53005dfee4dd7141b84dac223e90e67","title":"tottenham v leicester premier league live","story":"The brilliant Harry Kane scored two and created one as Spurs kept themselves in the mix for a Europa League spot and left Leicester’s Champions League hopes in severe jeopardy And finally, here’s Nick Ames’ match report. Thanks all for your company and comments - enjoy the rest of your weekends. Mourinho says Brendan has done a great job but has trouble with injuries, and if anyone knows about them it is poor old put-upon Mourhino. He says he knew his team could win the game in transition, and by sitting deep they took away the space in which Vardy plays and now have a shot at making the Europa. He goes on to say that “we were phenomenal” at the back – their block was “always in control” and Lloris made a couple of big saves. He also praises the “amazing quality” of Kane, who is up there with the best he’s managed, praising him as a “striker, leader, team-player”, then asked if he can improve him, says if he can build a better team around him. As for Spurs, they’ve looked more like a team these last few games. They’ll need to do some good work in the transfer market if they’re to get back to challenging for the title, but they’re no longer painful to watch. I guess that if Leicester end up fifth, that’s still a good season for them. But given where they were, it’ll feel like a heel to the solar plexus. At Wembley, the second cup semi is underway. Click here, and Rob Smyth will guide you through it. Harry Kane is very pleased with how Spurs countered in the first half, and though they dropped too deep in the second half, he’s pleased. He felt confident and sharp today, and did a lot of work as well as taking time to rest during lockdown, and feels as good as he’s felt for five years. He’s less pleased when it’s put to him that Gary Neville said he’s got his “running power back” – most particularly the inference that he ever lost it. He proceeds to remind us that he scores 20+ goals every season, injured or not, and in the silences we see him waving metaphorical fingers. “It’s just one of them,” he says of his second goal, and he’s right, it was. Leicester played pretty well in the first half, but didn’t take their chances and Harry Kane was just too good for their depleted defence. Spurs move above Wolves into sixth place, giving themselves a decent shot at the Europa League – Wolves meet Chelsea in their final game – while Leicester stay fourth on goals scored from Manchester United. But in all likelihood, their Champions League hopes were extinguished this afternoon, because they’ll probably need to bear United on Sunday, and with that same defence. A rotten afternoon for Leicester and a fine for Spurs, Harry Kane in particular. 90+3 min “Who’s your man of the match?” asks Martin Tyler of Gary Neville – perhaps the most redundant question of all-time. Kane has scored two fine goals and made another – what a player he is. 90+1 min Hirst doesn’t wait to be asked. He picks the ball up outside the box, then whips an outswinger just wide. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes.90 min Gedson finds Davies outside him, and he crosses looking for Kane, but he’s on his heels. Please do not adjust your screens, that is not a misprint. 89 min “Just to point it out,” emails Tom Barnett-Young. “Leicester wouldn’t need to beat United by the same amount United beat West Ham, only by half that amount. Leicester’s winning margin against United would effectively have double the impact on the teams’ goal difference differential, since each goal would simultaneously improve Leicester’s goal difference by one while reducing United’s by the same amount.”In other words: I am a moron. 88 min Iheanacho curls a shot from the edge of the box that Lloris tips around the post and the ensuing corner is a good one, finding Hirst at the back post! But he panics and heads wide. That was a good chance, one of a few Leicester have had. 86 min Sanchez ploughs through Hirst - welcome to THIS LEAGUE, old mate – and Sanchez is booked. Gray deposits the free-kick directly into the wall. 85 min Iheanacho drives towards the box and unloads for Vardy, who tries one more to Thomas – he’s in space – but Sanchez intercepts. 85 min In commentary, they’re talking about Watford and Nigel Pearson, which tells you that this game has died a death. 82 min Leicester have lost their vim. Gray shoves wide to Thomas, whose cross is easy for Lloris. 81 min Kane runs across the line as Davies sweeps a pass into space he finishes as adroitly as you’d expect, but he was well offside. 79 min “I disagree on Kane,” says Jeremy Dresner. “The man is more beautiful mind than beautiful self. He is obsessed with records. The only questions is if Jimmy Greaves’ Tottenham Hotspur’s highest ever goalscorer (266 goals) and the highest goalscorer in the history of English top-flight football (357 goals) are more interesting than rewards elsewhere. It’s different to being selfish per se.”I don’t mean it in a pejorative sense. Just that he’ll prioritise whatever suits him, not whatever suits Spurs, and rightly so. 77 min Lamela and Bergwijn replace Lo Celso and Moura. 76 min Evans and Kane scuffle for the ball, Evans introducing arm to face but probably in error. VAR sees nothing amiss. 75 min Lamela and Bergwijn, who Mourhino assured us wasn’t fit, will soon be upon us. Maybe it’s a test.73 min Kane eases away from Evans, gleefully accepting the shove both of them know is a matter of principle in such circumstances. Evans is booked. 71 min Mendy finds Gray, who finds Praet ... who shoots directly into legs from 25 yards. A goal for Leicester would make such a difference, because if United beat West Ham on Wednesday, they’ll need to beat them by the same amount. 69 min Change for Leicester, Tielemans and Ndidi going off – perhaps to save them for the humungous effort next Sunday will demand - with Mendy and Praet replacing them. 68 min Leicester scurry about trying to find something, Iheanacho moseying along the left by-line and winning a corner ... which Lloris comes and punches clear! I know! We then check VAR to see if Sanchez fouled Evans at the ball came across, which he did not, and that’s ... drinks. 66 min Evans plays a blind pass and Son intercepts, racing forward before botching his pass to Kane. My little group of Manchester United fans used to call Evans 98 Percent, because he could be good for that much of a game, then do something terrible, just like that. 64 min Barnes is enjoying his free role and he wriggles space 20 yards out, dragging a shot straight at Lloris. 63 min “Harry Kane - not as much as he loves himself, quoting me back to myself. “Footballers are generally not overburdened with humility but I have not seen a lot of evidence to suggest Kane is any worse than his peers in this regard. I assume you have?”No, that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying that his loyalty is to himself, not a club, so I’d not be surprised to see him plump for more trophies and more money by moving away from Spurs. This is in no way meant as a criticism - no one should ever feel obliged to work for anyone. 61 min Leicester move the ball about, but they know the jig is up. Take players as good as Ricardo, Chilwell, Soyuncu and Maddison out of any team, and they’ll struggle, but unlike those they’re competing with, Leicester just don’t have the resources to compete. It’ll never happen, but I wonder if the best way of redressing this kind of imbalance would be to limit subs to two or three – though that might hamper the development of younger players. 59 min Change for Leicester, Iheanacho replacing Perez. Leicester seem to be playing a 4-3-1-2, with Harvey in the hole.59 min Tielemans sends over an outswinger, but Morgan can’t get his head properly behind it and his effort goes wide. 58 min Gray fancies this, curling into Sissoko’s back, peeling off the wall, and forcing Lloris to tip over for a corner which yields another. 57 min Moura is late on Tielemans, earning himself a booking. Free-kick Leicester, 25 yards out, just left of centre...56 min Leicester win a free-kick out on the left and Tielemans curls in an absolute scumbag. For a second it looks like Morgan is there, but Davies does brilliantly to force himself underneath it, heading behind. I’m not sure why Lloris didn’t come for that, but he soon has the ball in his hands when the corner comes over. 54 min A long ball sets Kane against Morgan and he brushes him off ... is this the hat-trick? No it is not, because Morgan, huffing and puffing, does really well to get back at him, and the shot is blocked wide for a corner that comes to nothing. 52 min “I can’t wait for headlines proclaiming how good Mourinho’s team were during this match(at least during the first half that is),” emails Aamir Mohamedy. “Meanwhile, I cannot help but wonder what Kane’s thinking right now with the transfer window around the corner. Should he stay and help keep the Spurs in contention for European football for the year after. or should he move to places where he might actually win a trophy. Surely, this can’t go on forever!”It’s tricky, because hardly anyone, if anyone, has the money to buy him and he clearly loves Spurs. Not as much as he loves himself, though, but I’d expect him to give it one more season at least. 51 min Moura has really tested Thomas these last 20 minutes, and he spins him here, forcing a free-kick out of him. Spurs are looking lively in attack, much better than a few weeks ago. 49 min I should note that Leicester haven’t changed formation. Tielemans moves the ball to Gray, whose shot is blocked. 48 min Kane’s passsing! He mooches across the centre-circle, has a look, mooches some more, then lasers a gorgeous reverse-pass into the path of Son! For a second it looks like he’s in, but he can’t collect properly, slipping trying to right his first touch. 47 min So what do Leicester do here? If they go wild looking to score, they could easily concede more maybe they need to stay in the game at try to repair the goal difference, so that if they beat United next Sunday, they finish above them. 46 min Ryan Bennett, who will not remember his afternoon’s work fondly, is replaced by Demarai Gray. 46 min We go again. Elsewhere, the teams are in for the Chelsea-Man United cup semi. Rob Smyth has more here...“Jose is building this team after his great counter attacking Real Madrid team of 2011-12,” reckons Jeremy Dresner. “This is effective and he has the explosive players to hurt teams that come to play. Don’t want to be downer with a 3-0 half-time lead but unlocking the safe at Roy’s ‘banks of four’ next week will be a more tricky challenge for this team.”Yes, I see what you’re saying, but to succeed in that style requires a much better defence and midfield than he has. I wonder if it’s circumstance that is forcing him to play that way. “As a finisher, Kane is close to Shearer,” tweets Roy Everitt, “but there’s a fair bit of Sheringham in his passing and anticipation, too.”Yes, I can see that – imagine if he got that wad of hair sticking out at the back. His passing is both extremely underrated and extremely good, but for building play rather than creating goals. “Rodgers teams perform better when there are no expectations,” says Ambar Bokare. I’m not sure about that. Taking on Harry Kane with that back four is like taking on coronvirus with Boris Johnson.

Talk franklyFrom teachers wearing masks at school to cancelled holidays, coming out of lockdown can mean tricky conversations and how you approach these topics can make all the difference. Rosenhead explains: “Our children – whatever age they are – are our mirrors. So, before you talk to them, check in with yourself. ‘Am I stressed? Overwhelmed? Anxious?’ and address what you need, even if it’s just five minutes in a room by yourself. Because it’s not what you’re saying but how you’re saying it that’s important.“Then, think about what you’re going to tell your children (don’t just blunder in) and get on the same level as them – difficult conversations are often best had when you’re doing something together, such as going for a walk or playing snap. With a four-year-old, it could be colouring in, while for teenagers it may be gaming together or cooking.”3. Let them take over“The way children have been really affected by the pandemic – from younger ones right the way through to young adults – is a lack of agency. As a child, you don’t have much control anyway but now that’s shrunk right down,” says Rosenhead. “Any sense of independence at school is no longer happening, which can also affect their self-esteem and mental wellbeing. So you need to counter this with connection, communication and giving them their agency back.“For example, I’ve been going on daily bike rides with my 10-year-old daughter and I now let her cycle on the road, which I never would have done before lockdown. I let her choose the route, even when she’s got me riding all over the place it’s giving them the opportunities to decide things.” So from navigating with your map app to picking items for online shopping or Googling holiday destinations for the future, let your kids take over some big decisions.5. Do something brand newSearching out recipes for sourdough starters, asking Alexa how to plant tomatoes, downloading Couch to 5K … hobbies have come into their own in lockdown. “Shared experiences are enormously bonding and learning together is a great leveller,” recommends Rosenhead. “Children and teenagers are so used to being told what to do but if you’re both out and about learning something new, you’re doing it as equals. These things give a sense of togetherness and will build memories.” So, yes, studying “How to pogo” videos in the park creates an important parent-child connection. “Hopefully, this time together will be one of the good things our children will take with them into the future,” says Rosenhead.From helping your kids stay connected with their friends to sharing time together as they acquaint you with the intricacies of TikTok, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

For her, this was a great treat a widow since before we were born, she loved to be with us, and she loved the feeling she was treating us. But we were perhaps a bit more ambivalent. Our treat came with… complications. Granny was blind, and new places were tricky for her (not that she’d ever admit it). Additionally, she was a terrible snorer. In a holiday park chalet only twice as big as a bus shelter, the chances of us getting a decent night’s sleep – or any sleep at all – were slimmer than a Wham bar (original raspberry flavour).But we’ll come back to Wham bars. The point is that we went to Withernsea, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. This was not a glamorous place. At the time, I’d barely heard of it – why, I wondered, couldn’t we go to Bridlington? – and in the decades since, I’ve never met a single other person who has ever been to the town, let alone stayed there for a whole week. Google it, and you’ll find that its greatest claim to fame is the fact that it’s the birthplace of the actress Kay Kendall – and who’s heard of her, these days? (Please don’t write in I adore Kay Kendall, though perhaps not quite enough to visit Withernsea’s lighthouse, which now houses an exhibition devoted to her.) But I digress. No, Withernsea, was not glamorous. On the first day, I gazed out at the gunmetal North Sea, and thought sulkily of those friends lucky enough to be taken to Spain. God, life was so unfair.And yet, I’ve never forgotten that place, with its pier towers that look like the turrets of a castle. It’s always with me. I cherish the memory of my granny, who let us have ketchup with lamb chops, and I tend to hold it (meanly, perhaps) in my mind when I hear spoiled 21st-century children talking about their all-expenses paid holidays abroad with mummy and daddy, as if such things were a human right. Above all, though, it has for me become a kind of symbol even, perhaps, an allegory. Those chilly, haphazard days, at once both quite boring and replete with illicit delights, are the British summer holiday of yore in microcosm: its absolute crumminess its ineffable perfection. Thinking of one particular picnic we had on its wide, dun-coloured beach, our skin goosepimpled and our toes glazed with damp sand, I’m apt to come over all Marcel Proust (save for the fact that where he needed a plump madeleine, shaped like a scallop and soaked in tea, fully to stir his remembrances, I ideally require a homemade corned beef sandwich, a bag of Walkers French Fries and, for afters, a Blue Riband wafer). An exquisite pleasure invades my senses, and for a brief moment, yes, the vicissitudes of life become indifferent to me, its disasters (almost) innocuous.Don’t tell me you don’t know what I’m on about. Especially in this moment. For haven’t our thoughts turned even more than usually to the past during this long, sad lockdown? My sense is that many of us, if not most, are retreating, to various degrees, into a certain nostalgia. In large part, this is because the future is so uncertain. There’s comfort in how things used to be seeking it out is a perfectly natural thing to do in a time of collective mourning. But perhaps, too, it has to do with the fact that the future is going to look quite a lot like the past, at least for a while. This summer, after five decades of package holidays and low-cost flights, most of us will be holidaying at home – just like we used to. (As the former MP Nicholas Soames puts it, albeit with some overstatement, in British Summer Time Begins, Ysenda Maxtone Graham’s new book about the long school holidays, once upon a time “no one went abroad, except to fight a war”.) People, then, are getting ready: for bad weather, bad roads and, quite possibly, bad food.If you’re my age, and from my kind of background, you remember both states: the nirvana of, say, one’s first visit to France, with its remarkable yogurts and its even more remarkable cheese – and the rather less transcendent experience of “breaking your journey” to the Lake District with roadside Dairylea cheese triangles and an orange Club that you would try not to throw up later as your dad made heavy weather of every gear change, and your mum tried not to cry on account of her map reading having been described as “absolutely bloody rubbish”. I was nine when I first went to France on holiday, and 25 before I stepped foot in any other foreign country (save for Israel, but that doesn’t count because we lived there). The vast majority of my childhood holidays were spent in the UK: at the seaside with my granny in a cottage in Northumberland and at other rented properties (see also, youth hostels) in the cold, damp north with my mother and stepfather and in a hotel in Cumbria with my dad. Occasionally, my stepfather sends me and my siblings digital versions of the zillions of slides (believe me, they were all the rage at one time) that can be found in his attic, and they always make us hysterical with laughter. The meagreness! The deprivation! The chilblains! It’s like a Monty Python sketch gone wrong. It’s like Oliver Twist, only with baked beans and Orange Maid lollies. (My stepfather, incidentally, used to add curry powder to baked beans, the better to make them taste… more exotic.)Ah, yes. The food. It was quite bad, and quite limited, and yet we enjoyed it so much. Well, sort of. In hotels, it was always the same. To start: fruit juice, soup or pâté with toast. To follow: some kind of roasted meat with some kind of sauce, and soggy veg. Pudding was trifle or (that great multipurpose word) “gateau”. In seaside places, you ate fish and chips. Or… fish and chips. In holiday cottages, it was pretty much like a weekend at home: spaghetti hoops on toast, say, or tinned tomato soup. Camping? Camping was hell. The least comfortable weekend of my life was spent at Ingleborough in North Yorkshire. We went with another family, and they (the lucky bastards) had a camper van, from inside of which they watched us, hot tea and biscuits in their hands, labouring over our guy ropes in the howling wind. Biscuits, by the way, were the ultimate holiday food, easily transportable and consumed in vast quantities in all the above places. Like an army, we marched on them. I was mad for Viscounts and Breakaways (the biscuit equivalents of champagne), but I could also put away my body weight in squashed flies and custard creams (the biscuit equivalents of pomagne).I remember eating out hardly at all. In most places, there was a Chinese restaurant, and an Indian. But for some reason, these were for “locals”, not visitors. I guess there were other places, but either they were very bad indeed, or prohibitively expensive and not for us the casual dining trend, at which it’s so easy to sneer (but I never will), was still far in the future – pizza was fairly hard to come by – and even middle-class families were so much more careful, not to say parsimonious, then. Pubs did food – well, sandwiches and ploughman’s lunches – but if you were a kid, you had to sit outside with your slab of cheddar, your pickled onion and your small cow pat of Branston (guzzling your limeade, you wondered, almost fearfully, what kind of debauchery was taking place within – did it also involve vinegar?). No, away from base, packed lunches were the thing. I still thrill to the phrase “packed lunch”, suggestive as it is of Sandwich Spread and Salt’n’Shake crisps – though there was always the fear that my mother would include a stinky hard-boiled egg (in my memory, she was obsessed with hard-boiled eggs, secreting them away absolutely everywhere, including her handbag).Cut to 2020. Things have changed unimaginably. You never used, for instance, to see much seafood on the coast, bar those little polystyrene pots of sharp cockles to be eaten with a wooden fork what was not battered went elsewhere. These days, though, you’re apt to find it all over the place: in shacks, and cafes, and restaurants even in fish and chip shops, sometimes. The word “langoustine” trips from mouths as easily as the word “saveloy” or “pasty”. Lovely bread is easy to come by. The smallest, rural places often have good delis and proper sandwich shops. And there are good restaurants special restaurants, in fact, whatever certain metropolitan critics might have you believe. I know a place in Northumberland not too far from the dank cottage where we used to spend long afternoons communing with our biscuits, where you can eat the kind of things that used only to be available in France: local meat, game, fish and cheese exceptional salads. Except – I can hardly believe I’m writing this – the cooking is miles better than it would be in France now, where something has gone badly wrong (but that’s another story).And yet… this summer is different, freighted for all of us like no other with complex emotions and the high stakes that are the inevitable result of having been cooped up at home for so long. I think we’ll be after every delight available to us, up to and including lamb shanks and nettle risotto. But we will also want – we will also need – various other things, too: the foods of our pasts, soothing and slightly comical and mostly happily inexpensive.I can’t speak for you, but I know what I want when I’m done with all the moules marinieres and Cotherstone cheese on sourdough, with the smoked this and the salted caramel that. I’m thinking of crinkle-cut chips and FAB ice lollies of shepherd’s pie eaten after walking in the rain, with frozen peas and those little tinned carrots, salty sweet, that I haven’t eaten in thirty years of a parma violet or a Refresher, lodged below my tongue until it melts. I would like to eat a mint Viscount once again, peeling back the foil slowly. I quite fancy – I can hardly believe I’m writing this – some tinned ravioli, or a bag of iced gems, neither of which I particularly liked the first time round. I could really go for a steak pie, followed by a custard slice. At the pub, let there be two bags of scratchings, one for now and the other for one pocket of my waterproof (in the other, inevitably, would be some liquorice comfits). I want to go back to where we began, a Wham bar (original raspberry flavour)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94f9de38e11cf9f03489544b5fc1f26645808b34/0_124_7457_4475/master/7457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb34ce32db26099b9abc246c9358cf58","title":"twice in a lifetime milstones missed in covid19","story":"Can you reschedule a landmark moment? We talk to a musician, a centenarian, a graduate, an engaged couple and an Olympic hopeful about their special occasion that got cancelledI was in the Irish National Rowing Centre in Cork in March, getting ready to go on the water, when I heard that the Olympics were postponed. That was on a Tuesday. I needed a plan. I’m a junior doctor I’d taken time out of medical training for rowing. I got straight on the phone and asked if I could come back to work the next week. Within two hours, I had all the forms filled in. I was on the general medicine ward in Daisy Hill hospital in Newry the following Wednesday.I was doing medicine long before I ever rowed. I gave rowing a go in my second year at Queen’s University in Belfast. I started winning British university titles. I posted good times and came 15th in the men’s single sculls at the World Cup 2018. But you’re not going to make your name coming 15th. I was ready to leave rowing behind me. After my final year of university, I gave the Irish trials one last lash. My coach suggested Ronan Byrne and I would be good double sculls partners. We decided to give it a shot.We had a short period to work together, starting in April last year in Cork. We’d a half-day off every week. I couldn’t drive home and back in that time so it was a massive decision to train full time. I didn’t see my friends, gave up a relationship and had to leave my mum, who is on her own since my dad passed away five years ago. It was validating when we qualified for the Olympics representing Ireland at the World Championships in August. It was something to bring back home and say to people I went away, I’m sorry but this is what I did.Initially I thought I’d be happy just going to the Games for the T-shirt and the experience, but when we started producing results, I realised we were contenders.When the Olympics were postponed, it felt like another year lost. I’m supposed to complete my first 12 months of medical training within a three-year window and I’d already given up a year of that to full-time rowing. I couldn’t change the Olympics postponement, but I could complete my foundational year in medicine before the Olympics in 2021.It was daunting coming back to medicine. I knew I’d be returning to a different healthcare system than the one I left. I’m on the general medicine ward it’s been very busy. It’s good to have a purpose and to go back to something that is appreciated by the public. I still train every day on a rowing machine in the garage and, since lockdown eased, I’ve been back out on the water. But medicine is my job when rowing stops this is what I do. My passion is emergency medicine. I love those situations where you have to act now. I’ll finish on the ward in December and go back to rowing full time ahead of Tokyo 2021. We want to win it.Niamh McManus and David BennettNiamh: We got engaged in Sicily last year. We didn’t want a long engagement. A year felt like enough time to stress about a wedding. We had all the hard stuff done and we had eight weeks to go when it all fell apart.David: Niamh’s mum rang me in early March. She asked me: “Is Niamh out of the room?” She didn’t want her to hear what she was going to say. She thought there was a very good chance the wedding would have to be called off. I was heartbroken, but she was right.Niamh: I knew the wedding wasn’t going to happen. Pulling a wedding apart is not any fun at all. We are mindful of much bigger problems in the world, but this meant a lot to us. I was looking forward to those special moments you get to have with people, like the dress-fitting with my mum. Dave is a personal trainer and a musician he has a music project called Short Pier and the session musicians who play with him were due to be our wedding band. We had to cancel that. We had guests who were travelling from Nigeria and Australia.David: When the cancellation emails came through, it was difficult to take. But we still hoped to get married in the registry office. But when the registry office cancelled, I’d had enough. I said to Niamh, we have our rings, you can wear a nice dress, I can wear something nice. We can go to the river in our neighbourhood where we can exchange vows and rings and, in our eyes, we’ll be married. Nobody can cancel on us because I’m not going to cancel on you. You’re not going to cancel on me. We went ahead on 21 May, our wedding day. And it was magical.Niamh: It was just ourselves. Two dogs watched. A photographer friend came down and took some photos and we got a Thai takeaway afterwards. Our families were a bit sad, They’d love to have been part of it. A lot of people sent cards or rang, which I really didn’t expect. That meant an awful lot. It was so nice to know that in the middle of all their own problems people were thinking about you as well. We’re not legally married so hopefully we’ll be able to do it all together next year. But I feel married now, actually.David: I do, too. Absolutely. Niamh’s my wife.I was always a songwriter and dancer. So when my dance track, Hideaway, became a hit in 2014, it gave me the opportunity to do both. I was performing every day for two years. It became my life. I went from playing open mics in front of five people to being on the stage at Wembley, six months later.I had started writing my next album when I was in a car accident in July 2017. The Uber I was in was knocked off the road. I saw the car coming, curled into a ball and was thrust forward. I suffered a traumatic brain injury. That was the end of that era for me.Brain injuries are painful in ways you can’t explain. I lost balance on the left side of my body. To begin with, I fell down stairs, I had bad headaches and problems with digestion. It’s an injury that no one can see. I had to stay home all the time. If I went out, I would come home in excruciating pain. I could barely do anything.When I first started in music, just getting a song out was a huge milestone. Coming back, it is very different. Last year, I went on this tiny acoustic tour. I kept it small. I gave myself a few months to get my stamina up and I surprised myself. It was amazing. So from there it became about setting new milestones.This year was set to be a big milestone for me. I was getting back to dancing. I’ve been dancing in my new music videos. I’ll dance and then I’ll crash for three days afterwards because my brain is so tired. I navigate my career based on the injury. I was set to open for my friend Lindsey Stirling this summer on her tour. I wasn’t ready to do my own headline tour but I wanted to tour so bad. I knew I could do a 30-minute set if I started rehearsing and building my stamina up. I’d planned to dance and sing in the show. The pandemic ended those plans.I was at home in Toronto when I heard from my manager about the tour cancellation. I wasn’t shocked because by that point almost every tour in the world had been cancelled. But it would have been a big stepping stone on my road to recovery. As hard as it was to hear that the tour was cancelled, I understand the need to keep people safe during the pandemic.It simplified the way I look at the world. When people get bad news they fall fast and hard. I don’t fall any more. I stay on level ground. My health is good now. Each day I’m stronger. I have no idea when we are going to be touring again. My life isn’t the same without it but I look at it this way: I have more time to be a better performer. So when we do tour again, I will be able to do a full show. That will be amazing.Kiesza’s album, Crave, is out on 14 AugustI celebrate my birthday every year. It’s no different turning 100. I just like parties – I like my friends. It was awful not having one this year but I’m saving it up. I’m going to have one as soon as we can get going.Oh, it’s awful right now but when we get free it will be lovely. The first thing I’ll do when it’s over is go for a long drive, up and down the moors. My friend takes me. I love the moors. I was brought up in the New Forest and the drive is as near the New Forest as I can get. It’s like being home.I was born in Croydon. My mother died when I was three. I didn’t know her. I never saw a photograph of her. It would be nice to see that. I had a lovely stepmother, she was wonderful. I’ve been in Devon most of the rest of my life. I had a dairy herd and was a Land Girl on my farm during the war. Then I joined the Women’s Voluntary Service, working in Germany.It is like the war now you can’t do what you want to. But we got used to it then, the same as we get used to it now. I do miss church. I’ve been going to St Mary’s Church in Mariansleigh for 50 years. I never miss a Sunday. I did my own shopping until a few months ago. I still do my own cooking. I do have carers, but I don’t like other people doing my cooking for me.I heard in May that we would be graduating in absentia. It’s a disappointment. You don’t go to Cambridge just to graduate, but there’s a real sense of closure that you get in that moment. You get to be with your friends and be aware that you actually finished a Cambridge degree. That’s quite a solid moment. To have that taken away was deflating.I did my degree in music. I have my gown, so I’ll take some pictures in that. It would be nice to spend some time with my family. I was hoping to have my grandma, Joyce, at graduation. She’s the only grandparent I have left. She came to England from Jamaica in the 1960s and she did everything she could to give her children and her grandchildren a better life. She used to drive me to piano lessons she always loved me to perform. Being her first grandchild to go to university was a big deal for her. I’d hoped that graduation would have been a moment we could have shared.Graduation offers a sense of closure. I was the only black girl in the music faculty throughout my degree. A lot of the time at Cambridge it was easier to not think about how I stood out and felt isolated. Now, it hits home that I did the whole thing on my own. Graduation would have been a big moment, especially considering some of the things I’ve experienced in the music faculty.At a dinner in my first week at Cambridge, I had a conversation about rap and hip-hop with an academic who told me that black music was noise. I’m a big fan of musical theatre. It’s what I’d like to do as a composer. I talked about how Hamilton is a hip-hop musical. He said, yes well, it’s not very good. I decided to put up a fight and said maybe hip-hop is poetry. You may as well start as you mean to carry on. This person got the idea I wasn’t going to back down.Teaching in my faculty wasn’t necessarily gendered or race specific but my course focused a lot on white men. It’s isolating to not see anyone who looks like you or to know there are histories that aren’t being talked about. I wanted to open the academics’ eyes to something new. I wrote my dissertation on Amanda Aldridge, the black woman who music forgot. She was the daughter of the first black Shakespearean actor, Ira Aldridge. I’d never heard of her – there was very little written about her work as a singer and composer.I come from an educationally privileged background, which I am aware of and grateful for. I got a scholarship to a private sixth form, which really helped push me towards Cambridge. In an ideal world, a younger black girl would have seen me graduate and perhaps thought, maybe I can do that. I was the only black girl in GSCE music, the only black student in A Level music, so I knew Cambridge would be difficult, being the only person like me in that space. But I got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd1fac1604276a174d101380ba9d56071e09a24/0_491_4897_2937/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25c5e4642cc483b9e0a7912dff90ff1f","title":"i forgot how to cry as a man hrt gave me a range of emotions i never thought possible","story":"While many focus on the physical aspects of gender transition, for Cadance Bell, the greatest benefit was existential, like putting the right fuel into an engine for the first timeI forgot how to cry as a man. Laying in an economy box at the end of the funeral home was my departed grandmother. Flowers my mum had chosen hung from a borrowed vase. I sat with my family, numb. I knew I should feel something about her death, but I was empty.A celebrant was riffing from a lectern. “Sharon, I hear, was a lovely woman,” she said. “It’s Shirl,” came a hesitant voice from the audience. I cringed. “Sorry, Shirl. And now, she’s up there in the Lord’s kingdom in a great big room, with all of the friends who got there before her, and they’re so happy. They’re laughing with Sharon and they’re smiling, and they’re all eating her favourite cake!”I exhaled, deeply. “Right,” I said, standing up. “I’m out!” I squeezed my hairy, manly frame past the mourners in my row. I stepped on my mum’s toes, apologised, and then slipped up the aisle and out of the building.Outside, I stood with my back against the wall and watched the morning traffic on the Mudgee highway. I thought about times I’d spent with nan, about her dry and endless Anzac biscuits – so tough you could prop up a wonky fridge with them.I wanted to cry. I knew I should, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t cried in years. At that point, I barely felt anything, and it seemed like a betrayal of my grandmother’s love. But I was as dead inside my male body as she was inside the box.A decade later, I’m a transgender woman. Thanks to hormone replacement therapy – or HRT – I feel again. There is a lot said about the obvious changes from HRT. The changes to secondary sex characteristics – skin, hair, fat and breasts. There is too much said about primary sex characteristics – that is, genitals. But for me, the real value of HRT is existential. It’s putting the right fuel in your engine, like filling up with unleaded instead of diesel at the pump.Trans women often describe the emotional benefit of their transition not so much by feeling something new, but by resolution. We’ve upgraded to high-definition emotions, feelings which are just below the surface instead of buried in entrenched layers of gender dysphoria. We still have to allow ourselves to feel, but because we no longer spend so much time hating our bodies, we can enjoy our existence again.Sometimes it can be overwhelming, especially after decades of feeling afraid to express yourself as the wrong gender. I still remember my first laughingcrying fit. A friend had given me the phone number for a person I idolised and told me they were expecting my call. The rush of gratitude, excitement, nervousness and giddy joy turned me to soup. One moment I was laughing, the next I was bawling. Then I was laughing about crying, and crying because I was laughing about it. To feel that range of emotions was something I never thought would be possible, and yet it’s now a monthly occurrence.There are other benefits, too. The loss of a male sex drive has been liberating. I loathed unwanted arousal, and as a guy it came often. Sometimes the male body just decides: it’s time to be aroused. I could get erections from the vibrations of a bus, from dropping a pie and sauce, from watching an ibis drink sweet nectar from a bin.For many men, this is a great perk. I would envy guys who could ride waves of testosterone, standing proudly, hanging one. They seemed so at ease and comfortable. But I would e beneath the waves, a part of me hoping I’d be swallowed in the undertow.With HRT, my sex drive has completely changed, and it’s joyous. I no longer feel driven or distracted by arousal. Nowhere is this more important than around my women friends. I can enjoy their companionship at a deeper level, as they share with me their favourite ways to be. I don’t fear that my body might betray me in their company.There is a heavy price to being transgender. Especially if, like me, you transition after your teenage years, when hormones have already wreaked havoc upon your body. My partner is also trans, and to complete our transitions in our 30s we’re up for at least $200,000 between us. If we did everything we wanted surgically, that amount could double. We might spend as much to live in ourselves as we would buying a rural house.The defining quality of people is that we shape our reality. Animals respond to information. We change it. It’s what has brought us medicine, clothing, houses, warm water and humble toilets. None of these things are strictly needed to live, but they make our existence better.Voluntary evolution is the hallmark of humanity. Gender affirmation, through hormone replacement therapy, is an awesome celebration of that quality. Trans and gender erse people today are in the forge of evolution, we are wayfarers, nova heralds. We seek out and discover new ways to be.It means I can be comfortable with who I am within myself, who I am around others. It’s made me a better person. When you transition, so does everyone around you. They must unlearn who they thought you were. That discovery can sometimes be daunting, but there is so much more love and joy to be found with a person who loves themselves. I often wonder what my grandmother would make of my newfound happiness, what she might say to see me evolved.It’s such a beautiful thing, I can cry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21382ead68abc187ee40d8b234df044e3bf7dd7/0_581_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48207ac7498a108879c536d15f400319","title":"curtis waters is the next big thing in pop thanks to a music clip on tiktok","story":"He started lockdown as a student making music in his bedroom and emerged three months later as the next big thing in pop – all thanks to a 15-second music clip posted onlineCurtis Waters went into lockdown a 20-year-old student with a part-time job making smoothies. He’ll leave a fully- fledged pop star, despite the fact he has barely stepped foot outside the house.“It has been so crazy,” he says, grinning, from his home in North Carolina. He looks young, with a fresh white T-shirt, hoop earrings and a mop of wavy hair. “Out of nowhere all this noise: everybody is staring at me, everybody wants something from me.” It’s still sinking in that he has entered what he calls the “realm of endless possibilities”.It would be tempting to dismiss this level of confident ambition as endearing but naive optimism: chances are this is the first time you’re seeing his name you have yet to hear a song of his. But in the space of just three months, powered by TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that is changing the way the music industry works, Waters has gone from unknown entity making music in his parents’ study to emerging hot property. He’s batted away record deals, signed up with management, and negotiated a licensing contract on his own terms. His catchy single – Stunnin’ – is a viral TikTok sensation, and has racked up an impressive 35 million-plus streams and counting on Spotify to date. This month, Rolling Stone ranked Waters third in their Breakthrough 25 chart, which tracks artists seeing the greatest growth in streaming. His already completed debut album is set for release later this year.In early April, Waters uploaded his first post on TikTok, which by then was being used by two billion people around the world. In the 15-second clip (the maximum length for posts on the platform), Waters and his 16-year-old brother Albert dance goofily together to a short snippet of Stunnin’: a youthfully irreverent, catchy blend of hip-hop and pop he’d recorded at home. Underneath, he posted a caption: “dancing to my song everyday until it goes viral tbh”. A few weeks later, it did, proving that TikTok is fast becoming the new grassroots centre of the music industry, the YouTube generation a relic of the past.The careers of most people working in the creative industries have been paused – if not stunted – by the global pandemic. Not for Waters, though. If anything, this time has offered up opportunities. He was already looking to bypass traditional routes into the industry. “I think we only did TikToks because I wasn’t at work and there was nothing else to do,” he says. “Otherwise I wouldn’t have had time to do silly dance videos every day.”The short TikTok posts Waters has uploaded have already hit viewing figures into the millions. But these numbers don’t scratch the surface when it comes to comprehending the true scale of Stunnin’s success. When artists upload a burst of their music to TikTok, other users can create their own videos which use this audio as a soundtrack. Stunnin’ has been used in other videos on the platform – at the time of writing – close to a staggering 500,000 times. It wasn’t long before music industry bigwigs had Curtis Waters in their sights.“The music industry right now is focused on TikTok,” he explains. “There are people at labels who just look for artists with trending sounds who they then try to sign.” And it’s not hard to see why.Over the past 12 months, TikTok has seen a steady flow of musicians go viral on the platform: new releases clocking up hundreds of millions of views in as little as 24 hours, often before they’ve taken off elsewhere. It’s a feeding ground for labels on the hunt for fresh talent: execs desperate to sign up artists who’ve proven their popularity before they transition to streaming services and the charts.Rapper Lil Nas X may be the platform’s most famous musical success story, but there have been many more. American singer Doja Cat’s tracks have amassed more than 8 billion TikTok views the dance routine to her song Say So has been performed by approaching 20 million users. It went on to hit No 6 on the global Spotify chart, No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (the Nicky Minaj remix), and make the UK Top 10. Emerging US hip-hop artist Curtis Roach released an original song on the platform in April which was snapped up by Sony.All things considered, Waters seems to be coping well with all the attention. It’s Monday morning local time when he logs in to Zoom, refreshed after a weekend (mostly) spent offline. He’s excited to get back to work again, but he was enjoying the respite of a few days spent just being Abhi Bastakoti again: Curtis Waters is a stage name, a character of his own design.In 2017, Waters and his family moved to the quiet, suburban town of Cary, North Carolina. It was the culmination of a “long immigration struggle” that saw the family travel from his birthplace of Nepal to India, Germany and Canada: dad chasing PhD scholarships, mum completing her masters along the way. Music didn’t figure much in his life until, aged 14, he discovered Odd Future, Kanye West and Tyler The Creator. In the midst of an angsty teenage breakup, Waters was downhearted, and concluded the best way to get one up on his (now ex) first love would be to turn out just like these music stars.He set about learning, from scratch, how to make music with total focus. He listened relentlessly to the albums of these hip-hop legends, taking their lessons to heart. There’s a lyric in Spaceship on Kanye West’s 2004 debut The College Dropout which Waters became obsessed with: “You can’t fathom my love dude Lock yourself in a room Doing five beats a day for three summers.” So Waters did just that, turning to YouTube to teach himself how to produce. He’d stay up all night and skip school to make beats and prepare for competitions. All the while, “Curtis Waters” – Bastakoti’s alias – was slowly forming. As a teenager in Canada, Waters was consumed by depression. Graphic design and making music helped him navigate the turbulence. He developed a comic book character and christened him “Curtis Waters”, writing stories for his creation and recording a soundtrack alongside.Inspiration for the name came from his musical heroes: Joy Division’s Ian Curtis and Frank Ocean (and from there, Waters). He liked that it rolled off the tongue like Kanye West the idea of being a “skinny brown kid” with a name that sounds like it’s stolen from a broad-chested Caucasian cinema cowboy made him smile. The thinking behind picking a new name in the first place, however, is a little more profound. “This character was fun, bright and silly,” Waters says, traits he felt he’d long forgotten. “I started to dress like him, and when I made music, I could make myself feel like this person in my head.”Through this alter-ego, Waters found confidence. Making music under a pseudonym also allowed him to tackle topics that his parents – and at times conservative community – might have found uncomfortable. “There’s some shit in the album that’s so honest,” he says, “that I probably wouldn’t tell my friends in real life.”Take Six Pills, a song about mental health medication. Waters was diagnosed as bipolar during his first year at college, dropping out to take a break. The following year he returned determined to make it through. “My college started giving me prescription pills,” he says, “one for my bipolar which made me anxious one for my anxiety which would give me insomnia.” The anti-insomnia drugs made Waters throw up. Before the year was over, his immune system was failing and he had a breakdown.Returning home to North Carolina, Waters dedicated himself fully to his music. “My family wanted me to make up a cleaner story to tell our community about what was happening,” he says.Torn between a generational desire for total honesty, and still empathising with his parents’ desperation to keep up appearances, he discovered Curtis Waters could say what Abhi Bastakoti could not. By February this year, he’d written and recorded his album, Pity Party, and uploaded it to Soundcloud. It has since been taken down to be fine-tuned before its planned November release.“Take the first song on the album, which is about how I felt I was the shame of my family,” says Waters. “I’m so glad I made the album before Stunnin’ blew up. There’s so much truth in there, which could happen because nobody was listening. It’s important for people to know what we all go through, especially as a brown immigrant with mental health issues in the United States.”As a teenager, Waters says, he felt he couldn’t make close friends within his community. He was terrified word about his mental health would get round, and he’d be shamed. Now people are tuned in and ready to listen. He takes a deep breath: “It’s cathartic to now be telling you things haven’t always been OK.”Nothing much happened when Waters uploaded his first 15-second-clip to TikTok. With fewer than 100 followers, it came as little surprise. He’d written Stunnin’ months earlier, and uploaded a few soundbites to Instagram – the feedback glowing. Now, without a label or promoter, he needed to get it out to the world himself.TikTok is different to Instagram, where cultivating a dedicated following over time pays idends: users passively scroll through their home screens, double-tapping content posted by accounts they’ve chosen to follow. TikTok, meanwhile, focuses on exposing users to what’s trending, and they’re encouraged to interact. Waters realised he didn’t need to build up a fanbase on TikTok over time, he just needed his music to become a viral hit.He started to upload simple clips: dancing to the same section of Stunnin’ and filmed in different locations.“I tried it like six times at first and it didn’t work,” he says. The seventh time he tried it, the video hit 200,000 views overnight. “Holy shit,” he thought, “I couldn’t sleep that night. Every hour there were just hundreds of likes and comments. It was insane.” Noticing activity on the platform was higher at 7pm, the next evening he posted another on the hour and saw similar results.The way Waters sees it, TikTok has given artists like him more power in the often tense – and at times exploitative – musicianlabel relationship. Now, it’s possible to prove musical prowess and popularity without middle men taking credit and control. “You don’t need a label,” he argues. “Once you start thinking you need one, you lose.”Initially, labels wanted Waters to sign over the ownership of Stunnin’ pre-release with him keeping a small percentage. Now, in a licensing deal with BMG (substantial advance included), after 10 years the album’s masters revert to him. Curtis held his nerve, and proved he could do it all on his own.“I could do all this because I worked to the point where I wasn’t waiting for anyone,” he says. “There are no gatekeepers to the industry anymore. If you’re making good music and can see patterns in the algorithms, there’s really nothing you can’t do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59afa112361abd0310fa711ee450327213add50e/0_24_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54844d89fa0c11ab731b70c64591668f","title":"ellie goulding brightest blue review ego swae lee juice wrld","story":"(Polydor)Goulding’s first album since 2015’s Delirium is undermined by its tacked-on guest spotsLike footballers and boxers, pop stars have careers that rarely get better in their 30s, the exhilaration of youth collapsing into middle-aged mediocrity, experience elbowed aside by promise. This is British pop queen Ellie Goulding’s first thirtysomething album – and her first set in five years – and it’s awkwardly ided into two unequal parts, one with 13 songs, the other with five. The first half is “vulnerable side” Brightest Blue, while the much shorter addendum EG.0 offers a symphonic overture and modish hits with Swae Lee and the late Juice WRLD. EG.0 she oddly labels her “confident side”, even as she shelters in other people’s starlight.Goulding usually prefers to appear unthreatening and relatable rather than demand adoration, and that doesn’t change here, but her quality control has improved. The slower songs of part one are best, particularly the three-punch combo of Bleach, Flux and Brightest Blue, the last delivering an indelible chorus over pillowy synths and delicate harmonies. True, her say-what-you-see lyrics are still too pedestrian seas remain dark and stormy, lines between opposing things are thin. Yet the music often soars. Goulding should trust herself more: she might need more ego, but she doesn’t need EG.0.

In addition, Scotland has operated stricter rules about eating in public and easing social distancing compared with England.Although Scotland’s total number of deaths is above 4,000 and is higher than many countries with similar populations, new cases and deaths are now at very low levels, allowing the SNP to aim for an elimination strategy. For several consecutive days this month there were no deaths from Covid-19.On Saturday the SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said that his party was not shaping its Covid-19 strategy in order to open new ides with England or to bolster support for an independent Scotland. But he said he believed the SNP’s management of the crisis had won respect.“We are not doing this to strengthen the case for independence,” he said. “But I think people are reflecting on the leadership that has been given. There is a reaction to that leadership that is perhaps creating more of a confidence in independence. I think that everything that is going on is probably strengthening the case.”Blackford expects the SNP to win a stronger mandate in next year’s Holyrood elections, which he says he will reinforce calls for another referendum. “I think there will be another referendum,” he said.Sturgeon’s “total elimination” policy is being backed by leading scientists. “She is perceived to be a very safe pair of hands,” said Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy. “She seems to have a single imperative, and that is to try to eliminate the Covid-19 virus in Scotland. I have not heard that as an endgame in England.”Professor Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University’s Usher Institute, compared Sturgeon’s response to that of German chancellor Angela Merkel: “It is evident she is following the evidence closely herself. She is not just relying on people advising her. She is a bit like Angela Merkel. She is clearly spending a huge amount of time reading and absorbing material. I didn’t really hear that from the prime minister.”Bauld added that she had not spoken to anyone who had been critical of Sturgeon’s ability to communicate clearly with the Scottish public. “She is highly regarded by scientists for that,” she said.In a move that led her political opponents to criticise her for political posturing, Sturgeon threatened recently to close the England-Scotland border, while Johnson has claimed no such border exists. While flights and trains to Scotland could be halted, few analysts believe the myriad roads between the two nations could be sealed off.Critics of Sturgeon, however, point to the fact that other small nations – such as New Zealand – have done far better at limiting the spread of Covid-19 within their borders and have much lower death rates.Labour MP and shadow secretary of state for Scotland, Ian Murray, said: “The first minister being a better communicator than Boris Johnson doesn’t mask the SNP’s catastrophic failures, and if the bar is to do better than Johnson then it is no bar at all.“As we ease out of lockdown more gently a few days behind England, performance in both Scotland and Wales is now better than some parts of the UK, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that Scotland has one of the worst death rates in the world. It’s no comfort that England is doing worse and the figures in Scotland are certainly not something to celebrate given the tragic loss of life.”However, Glover – who is based at Strathclyde University – defended Sturgeon. “New Zealand is an independent nation. By contrast, Scotland has no independent fiscal powers. Like Wales and Northern Ireland it could not borrow to raise funds for lockdown and so was entirely dependent on what happens in the UK overall in regard to providing support for furlough. It had to wait for England to act, belatedly as it transpires.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325334d7557dea8b83f697debea0d307166ff5e9/0_290_5584_3350/master/5584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ddc5e9d7a54687e2776dd026d5e94a4","title":"uk urges eu countries to ensure britons living abroad can stay after brexit","story":"Government launches multimillion pound campaign to reach 1m British citizens in EUThe UK government is launching a multimillion pound communications campaign to reach the estimated 1 million British citizens living in the EU to ensure they know what steps to take if they wish to remain in their host countries after Brexit.And it is urging all EU member states to accelerate the process to enable British nationals to secure their rights amid concern among campaigners that some countries have not yet even opened schemes for UK citizens.“UK nationals living in the EU must be able to rely on the rights the withdrawal agreement gives them, just as EU nationals living in the UK can.“We continue to call on the EU and member states to protect the rights of UK nationals with faster implementation, longer application windows and clear communications, as the UK has done for EU citizens in the UK,” said a Foreign Office spokesperson.Their call comes weeks after the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, wrote to the vice-president of the European commission, Maroš Šefčovič, saying that while the UK had given EU citizens 27 months to apply for settled status, some EU member states were planning “short application windows that may not allow sufficient time for citizens to secure their rights”.The EU has confirmed that 13 countries, including France, where many British nationals live, have opted for a “constitutive” system similar to that in the UK requiring British nationals to apply for settled status.The remaining 14 member states have chosen the simpler “declaratory” system that allows British nationals to register their residency to demonstrate their right to continue to live, work or study in their chosen country.Spain, where an estimated 400,000 Britons live, has opted for the latter, giving campaigners hope that few will be left behind by the 30 June 2021 deadline for registration.It has also launched what local British campaigners are describing as a “warm” campaign, with the minister for inclusion, Hana Jalloul, telling Britons who want to remain that “this is, and always will remain your home”.It coincided with a joint statement with the British ambassador to remind Britons their rights are “guaranteed” if they are living there before 31 December.The country’s national statistics show 360,000 British nationals have already registered to be in the country with 104,000 living in the Andalucía province, including 62,000 in the costas around Malaga.Alicante and Valencia account for a further 97,000, with 40,000 and 29,000 in the Canaries and Balearics respectively.Sue Wilson, the founder of Bremain in Europe, a campaign group for Britons in Spain, said the fact that the Spanish government have chosen a simple declaratory scheme allowing rights to be “guaranteed” without an application for settled state a “great relief to British immigrants”.“We are grateful to the Spanish authorities for making the process as simple, seamless and painless as possible.”However, there is concern that there are tens of thousands of Britons who are off the radar, some elderly or vulnerable, and some who just don’t use the internet who may be more difficult to reach.The Foreign Office is working with three organisations in the country, including Age in Spain, with a big communications push to try to reach the over-65s around the Costas and Alicante.“I suspect a large number of people are out there who may not understand that there is an issue that they have to deal with because of Brexit, some of whom may not like to approach officials because they don’t know or fear how it might impact on things like taxation, health care,” said Helen Weir, the director of Age in Spain.Weir also said there was an important message to get out to relatives back in the UK. “If you have a relative in Spain who may not have residency or cannot cope with officialdom because they don’t speak Spanish or because they can’t cope with bureaucracy, you can contact Age in Spain and we can put them in touch with people who can help.”Of the 26 member states (Ireland is an exception, with British and Irish having reciprocal rights to remain in each others country after Brexit), Spain is considered one of the most advanced in preparations for the human cost of Brexit.France was due to open its application process on 1 July but has put it back to October because of Covid-19 and pressure will mount on countries to extend the deadlines for applications beyond 30 June next year to accommodate the challenges caused by the pandemic.So far, 14 countries, including Italy, Sweden and Portugal, have extended the deadline for British people to register or apply for settled status until October next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02068ad1688eeace7302ff32c3cd2a9ade97031f/0_0_3560_2374/master/3560.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=66359054b641e0b8450c422f52dcf28e

Responding to Malhotra the minister said: “As we re-introduce claimant commitments we are initially conducting these interviews by phone and testing a 30-minute commitment appointment.”In a report last year, the Social Security Advisory Committee said many stakeholders felt the allocated 50 minutes was insufficient for some. The report said: “Several stakeholders felt work coaches don’t have the time to explore all the potential elements of a claimant’s situation if it’s complex.”Malhotra said: “It beggars belief that the DWP are reintroducing sanctions at a time when they have had to almost halve the time for the claimant commitment interview – the first opportunity for a claimant to raise their often complex and challenging personal circumstances.“We are also seeing on average one vacancy advertised for eight jobseekers, rising to just one vacancy for every 20 jobseekers in some parts of the country. With the caseload for coaches also set to double, this raises serious questions about the quality of support jobseekers are receiving and the workplace stress new coaches could be put under.”Separately, analysis by Labour suggests that each work coach will have almost twice the number of jobseekers – 228 on average – to support by October this year compared with before the pandemic.This is despite the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announcing this month that the number of work coaches would be increased from around 13,500 to 27,000 by early next year.

We are worn out from working full-time at home and part-time home schooling. I am heartbroken that my nine-year-old son will have much of his holiday to fill by himself while his parents are expected to commit their time to work.“I don’t understand how holiday clubs can’t open when pubs and restaurants can, and schools have taken some year groups back,” she added.No residential, UK summer camps have been able to open this year after government guidelines released in early July stipulated that “holiday providers should not be offering overnight or residential provision for children”.Activity day-camps have either not opened or have cut the number of places they offer by more than a half to adhere to government guidance that they keep children in “small consistent groups of no more than 15 children”. Where consistent groups of 15 cannot be maintained, groups must only be outside and with a 1:5 staff ratio.World-camps.org, a directory of more than 100 camps in the UK, said not a single camp that advertises with them has opened this summer. “They all blame government restrictions andor global travel restrictions, which mean it’s just not financially viable for them to open this year,” said Alex Peipers, the co-founder of the site. “Some parents are even sending their children abroad to camps because the UK ones aren’t open,” he said. “We’ve had lots of requests from UK parents about camps in countries where the measures are less strict, such as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Austria.”SuperCamps, an Ofsted-registered provider of more than 40 day-camps across the UK, has not opened a single camp this year. Nor has the YMCA, Camp Indy or Barracuda, which owns 48 sites across the UK.A Barracuda spokesperson said: “These guidelines are not practical for holiday clubs who accept children for differing time frames dependent on parental needs.”Some sports clubs that operate in the open are managing to run classes but clubs that are technology-based have experienced a boon: “We’ve moved entirely online and are now able to reach double the number of children we usually would,” said Kirien Sangha of Fire Tech Camp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3086711e19089780e65a037524d7db2300cfb89/0_319_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00486a550482b05deed9f8b64093ad6c","title":"what happens when flu meets covid 19","story":"How seasonal viruses interact with the coronavirus is unknown – it may lessen or sharpen the pandemic – so flu vaccinations are vital Optimists had hoped Covid-19 might not withstand the blistering heat of a British summer. However those hopes have faded: the virus staged a recent resurgence in Iran amid actual blistering temperatures, and has had no trouble persisting in sultry Singapore.But what happens to Covid-19, and us, when the rain and chill – and flu and sniffles – of autumn set in? Especially, how will the annual winter flu epidemic play out amid a Covid-19 pandemic? One thing is a given. “We can expect waves of Covid in the fall,” says virologist Ab Osterhaus of the Research Centre for Emerging Infections and Zoonoses in Hanover. By then, he hopes, we might be better at treating severe cases, and more countries might be able to test, trace and quarantine all cases and their contacts, and contain the virus, better than they can now.The biggest worry in the UK is that hospitals can struggle to cope with the winter flu season. This year they will have to cope with Covid-19 as well, which shows no sign of going away by then, and could even surge if it turns out that cold temperatures, or the circulation of other autumn and winter viruses, boost its spread.The first problem will be figuring out which virus a patient has. Flu, Covid-19 and other seasonal respiratory diseases are virtually indistinguishable on the basis of symptoms, warns Barbara Rath of the University of Nottingham: even the loss of taste and smell many people get with Covid-19 is not unique. We need more and better diagnostic tests, she says, because the difference matters: medical staff need full protective gear to manage a Covid patient, but they can be vaccinated for flu.The real unknown is what Covid-19 does around other viruses. Every autumn there is a predictable series of outbreaks of respiratory viruses. It starts with rhinovirus, the main cause of the common cold, which breaks out every September as young children go to school and swap mucus. As no parent needs to be told, children are to sniffles what mosquitoes are to malaria.The rhinovirus subsides as most children are exposed and their immune systems activate. Then another virus breaks out: respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Every year in October or November, this causes mild colds in people of all ages, but sometimes severe lung infections in the youngest and oldest of us. RSV is so common that virtually all two-year-olds have already had it, and it sends more babies to hospital with pneumonia than any other virus.Then RSV subsides, and the annual flu epidemic sets in, anywhere from early winter to spring, driven mainly by transmission among children, but taking its main toll among the elderly: some 8,000 on average die yearly of flu in the UK. This predictable parade of infections almost seems a spiteful campaign by viruses to keep people, especially families with young kids, sick for as long as possible.But it is just a product of a little-understood phenomenon called “viral interference”: while one of these viruses holds sway in a person, or the population, for some reason the others can’t get a toehold. In September 2009, the swine flu pandemic that went on to sweep the world should have invaded Europe from the Americas. But the annual rhinovirus epidemic actually kept it at bay. The highly contagious new flu took over only when rhinovirus subsided, bumping RSV down the queue: RSV moved in only after that first wave of flu subsided.The question now is where Covid-19 is going to fit amid this viral jostling. Not every virus takes turns like this, says Ian MacKay of the University of Queensland. Sometimes you can be infected by two at once. So which kind is Covid-19?We do know it can infect someone alongside flu: the first Covid-19 case to die outside China was a 44-year-old man in the Philippines, who also had flu. We don’t know for sure that having flu at the same time makes Covid worse, but the fact that the Filipino victim was fairly young is worrying, says Florian Krammer of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. “We assume the outcome of co-infection is not great.”Doctors at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan report that in January and February this year, as Covid-19 took hold in the city while flu was still circulating, many Covid-19 patients had both viruses. Co-infection didn’t seem to change their chances of survival compared to people with Covid only, but they had more heart damage, and more and earlier runaway inflammation, the over-reaction of the immune system that kills many late-stage Covid patients.Elsewhere, however, we have had few chances to find out how often that happens. Last March, Covid-19 hit Europe as flu season was winding down, while lockdown stopped Australians from spreading flu as well as Covid and snuffed out the incipient flu season. But with little lockdown expected this autumn in the northern hemisphere, seasonal viruses and Covid will collide head-on.If there is significant viral interference, optimists hope the child-driven autumn epidemics might keep Covid-19 at bay, as they do each other. But those viruses are transmitted mostly by children, while it appears that Covid is mostly spread by adults: the viruses might just spread in parallel, in separate populations of children and adults. That might mean more sick people in total, with severe cases competing for a fast-dwindling supply of hospital beds.Or the fact that Covid seems to infect a different type of cell from the others might mean there is no interference, allowing co-infection with rhinovirus, RSV and flu, possibly making more people more seriously ill. “We need to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” says Osterhaus.And that basically means preparing for flu, because it is the only one of these viruses for which we have a specific antiviral drug and a vaccine, despite years of intensive efforts to develop a vaccine for RSV. “That means, get your flu shot,” says Krammer.Because flu viruses constantly evolve, though, a flu shot is something you have to get every year. Every February virologists try to predict which viruses will circulate the following winter, and companies put vaccine viruses on to grow in chicken eggs, in a process (dating from the 1940s) that takes six months.In the UK this is normally recommended for the pregnant, people over 65, schoolchildren and people at greater risk from flu because of underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or lung disease – pretty much the same conditions that increase your risk from Covid-19. “This year,” says Krammer, “it should be everybody,” as Covid-19 could increase the risk for everyone.This is partly because people who normally don’t get a flu vaccination because they are not in those high-risk groups might end up severely ill after all, because they caught Covid-19 at the same time – and of the two we can only prevent flu. Moreover, every year people who don’t officially need the flu vaccine end up in hospital anyway with some complication, typically pneumonia, that will further burden health services. Worse, they are then more likely to catch Covid-19 as well, while in hospital.But the manufacturing process for next winter’s flu vaccine is under way and while manufacturers say they will make as many doses as possible available, they expect demand to exceed supply, as countries face a winter of flu and Covid-19. Health secretary Matt Hancock announced “the biggest flu vaccination programme in history” this week, amid reports that the NHS has bought millions more vaccine doses than the 25 million it offered last year. But it is not clear how many more will be available.NHS England alerted doctors in May to make sure they lay in their full allotment of vaccine and make extra efforts to ensure the usual people are fully vaccinated, to take as much pressure as possible off health services next winter – although getting people vaccinated might be harder as PPE is still required for Covid-19.The NHS is also hoping every healthcare worker will be vaccinated. But there have so far been no plans for expanding vaccination to more people, beyond calls from Labour leader Keir Starmer for free flu vaccination for everyone over 50. That is reportedly being considered, but would require 10 million more doses of vaccine.Tamiflu, the antiviral drug that is vital for treating severe flu and saved lives in the 2009 pandemic, would also be useful to take pressure off hospitals, says Krammer. But stocks of the drug in Europe are thought to be low.The nightmare scenario would be if this year’s flu was not the normal seasonal type, closely related to the flu we saw last year and the year before to which we all have some immunity. Every now and then a totally novel flu virus emerges that few have any immunity to – this is when flu is called pandemic. Not only would the flu vaccine we are brewing now not work against it, a new one cannot be made in much less than six months.As for severity, the 2009 pandemic resulted in little more death than an ordinary, albeit bad, flu year – although deaths were in people in their 40s rather than people in their 80s as usual. But this was because that virus happened to be carrying surface proteins that everyone born before 1957 was immune to, as they were similar to the flu that circulated then. We needn’t be that lucky again.Last month scientists in China warned that a swine flu there showed worrying signs of adapting to spread among people. It hasn’t yet – but that is a reminder that flu pandemics can happen any time.The prospect of a flu pandemic hitting amid an existing Covid-19 pandemic is chilling. Death rates could be high and hospitals everywhere would be overwhelmed.But there is, possibly, some very good news on that front. The only way around having to constantly make new vaccine for every flu season and for any pandemic flu that emerges is to develop a vaccine that works for every strain of flu, by targeting bits of the virus that all flu has in common.Then we could be vaccinated once or twice as we are for other diseases, and remain immune regardless of what flu strikes. We could even stockpile universal vaccine if a bad pandemic strain hits and more people decide to be vaccinated.In fact development of a “universal” flu vaccine like this has been ticking along in scientific research labs for years. But none has ever had the expensive full-blown trials of safety and effectiveness in several thousand people required to put it on the market.That, say the researchers, is because usually only a big vaccine manufacturing company can mount such a trial. But companies must make a profit, and there has been little interest in universal flu vaccine. For one thing, it would mean replacing the current vaccine that people must buy every year with one they would need only once or a few times in their lives.But finally the first full-blown trial of a universal vaccine candidate is happening, funded by the European Investment Bank. On 1 July Biondvax, an Israeli company, reported that it had finished tests on the 12,400 people who took its universal vaccine last year, and final results are expected by the end of the year. If they are good, says the company’s chief scientist, Tammy Ben-Yedidia, Biondvax is already geared up to make 20m doses a year, and can readily build manufacturing plants.So we may not have this problem next year. But for Covid-19’s first real flu season this winter, we can only hope enough people get the existing vaccine to stave off trouble, for them and for healthcare systems everywhere.Debora MacKenzie is a science journalist, and author of Covid-19: the Pandemic That Never Should Have Happened and How to Stop the Next One (Bridge Street Press, £18.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee5d0c3a6161eb9b1fb5c1c908d51b3638fd349/0_114_2739_1644/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c661e0e6b2fc0bfb7e8cdd86a215ea1","title":"lewis hamilton wins hungarian grand prix mercedes max verstappen second","story":"There was, perhaps inevitably, a sense of deja vu as Lewis Hamilton took another consummate victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix. The world champion’s record at the Hungaroring is unparalleled. On Sunday he and his Mercedes team delivered again and this time with such overwhelming superiority that it put a palpable chasm between them and their rivals just three races into the season.Hamilton took an untroubled win with another flawless run from pole, enjoying a pace advantage married to perfect execution that could not be matched. In unusually cool temperatures for Budapest in July, Hamilton barely appeared to break a sweat.F1’s anti-racism stance in contrast was left looking altogether more chaotic, an issue the sport must resolve. On the grid most drivers were wearing “End Racism” T-shirts, with Hamilton and the majority also taking a knee before the national anthem. Yet it was a disorganised affair once more, with some drivers late or absent, and lacked a cohesive message. Hamilton is expected to address it with F1 again before the British Grand Prix on Sunday week.On track it is unfair to class such a drive as routine but the level at which the 35-year-old Briton is now performing means he makes races like this look easy. He was aided on Sunday by a lack of competition from across the grid, even from his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was third.Hamilton now leads the world championship race with 63 points, in front of Bottas on 58. Yet there was drama behind Hamilton, not least for Max Verstappen, who remarkably took second place despite crashing his Red Bull on the way to the grid.The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, bluntly summed up the advantage they are enjoying. “The car and its engine are a bit of a beast, just what we needed,” he said. “It is a car the drivers like, it has good driveability, lots of power and lots of downforce.”Hamilton enjoys racing in Budapest, as well he might. He has now won the last three grands prix at the track, is the race’s most successful driver and with his eighth victory in Hungary he has also matched Michael Schumacher’s record, scored at Magny Cours, of the most victories at the same circuit. This 86th career win puts him just five shy of Schumacher’s record. On this form it must be expected that he will surpass the German this season.Hamilton delivered the calm, controlled performance from pole to flag that has defined much of his success. Having opened up a gap from the off he was unchallenged throughout, relentlessly building a lead that was insurmountable even by the midway point. The numbers are daunting: three seconds clear by the end of lap one, he went on to lead by margins of up to 26 seconds – a country mile.Verstappen’s afternoon was an altogether more testing affair. Red Bull were enduring a difficult weekend in Budapest and he gave them a further headache before the race had begun. The Dutchman went off, locking up on a damp track on his lap driving to the grid 20 minutes before lights out, hitting the barriers and damaging his suspension. The team worked furiously to repair the damage and he was able to start the race. They did superbly: Verstappen made amends with an impressive drive to take second from seventh on the grid.He was rightly thankful to his team. “They did an amazing job,” he said. “I was fired up to get back in the car and show them the effort was not for nothing. It was a crazy 10 to 12 minutes.”He was, however, never in the fight for the lead. Mercedes have issued a definitive statement that they are in a league of their own this season. Dominant in Austria with its quick corners, they proved equally at home on the slow-to-medium-paced turns of the Hungaroring. Their strength across both types of circuit and the margin of advantage they have over their rivals are ominous indeed.Certainly Ferrari have reached only the foothills of the mountain they have to climb. Hopeful of an improvement in form in Hungary, they were disappointed. Sebastian Vettel was sixth and will not have enjoyed being lapped by Hamilton with 12 laps to go. The team put Charles Leclerc on to the wrong tyres early in the race and the Monegasque came home in 11th.Bottas, second on the grid, made what appeared to be a jump start in reacting to a light on his dash and in checking it went backwards to sixth. He was not penalised for the start but the day belonged to his teammate. At the end Hamilton had enough in hand to take a stop for the soft tyre to seal off the point for fastest lap, an indication of how seriously he is taking gaining every point toward securing his seventh title.On this form he is well on the way, Hamilton was once more untouchable. He and Mercedes have grabbed the championship by the scruff of the neck in this opening triple-header of meetings. Wresting it from them will be a tough task indeed.Red Bull, meanwhile, face an investigation by the stewards because they had “artificially dried the grid box” of Alexander Albon’s car by using the engine cooling air of their leaf blowers, a possible contravention of the rules stating no part of the track could be dried. Albon finished in fifth.Lance Stroll was fourth for Racing Point with his teammate Sergio Pérez seventh, in front of Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo. Kevin Magnussen was ninth for Haas, with Carlos Sainz taking 10th for McLaren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6b1f4b23a80c6e90dd158c603ac5ce57ba021d/0_38_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e5e72593465f5dd7ff03f766cd0b6e","title":"hungarian grand prix formula one live","story":"A dominant display from the seven-time world champion put him into the lead of this season’s championship with an eighth career win in HungaryHere’s the snap report on today’s race. Here’s the race positions. It was a bad race for me. Starting second but I lost it at the start. It was a light in my dash. I had to do the start again..it lost me places. It was pretty close with Max but it was still good points. Huge congratulations to everyone back home. Even more in the engine department. Honestly, it was one of my favourite races to race, even though I was out on my own. We had great pace. We had great pit stops, great strategy. Right at the end it was great to get on fresh tyres. We need to try and keep this up. My learned colleague reminds me that Sainz and Leclerc will have to use the same Ferrari car next season. “For pandemic cost-saving reasons, next year’s cars will all be the same. So Ferrari drivers can’t really think in terms of a faster car for next season, only improvements to this car.” Because of the coronavirus outbreak the design of the cars has been frozen for next season to keep costs down. The SF1000 is the car they take into 2021 almost two years of racing are at stake.Hamilton takes the plaudits in front of the empty stands and gives his teammates the elbow greeting.Max Verstappen is very happy. “You guys are legends,” he tells his Red Bull team. When he stacked his car in the preliminaries he looked done for the day but their speedy work saved the day. He takes the lead in the championship, with Verstappen in second and Bottas in third. “Fantastic effort this weekend, guys,” he says but it seemed effortless for him. 7070 DRS engaged for Bottas as he tries to take Verstappen but he can’t get close enough. The Red Bull will split the Mercedes pair and give Hamilton a clear lead in the championship. 6970 Hamilton flying but he has traffic to contend with but, yes, he has his fastest lap! Mission accomplished. Bottas is fighting hard but Verstappen is determined to hold him off. 6870 Bottas can see Verstappen. It’s going to be close over the final three laps between these two. 6770 Albon overtakes Vettel and is in fifth. Bottas sets a fastest lap. He is within three seconds of Vertsappen. Will Hamilton get the run at the fastest lap? 6670 Will Bottas get past Verstappen? That looks unlikely, lessening the need for Hamilton to gain a fastest lap. But hang on, there’s five seconds. Here comes Hamilton into the pits. It wasn’t he quickest but he comes out in front. 6570 Bottas still has the fastest lap. Hamilton will not have long to try and take it off him. “The balance is all over the place,” says an audibly distressed Leclerc. 6470 Hamilton’s gap up to almost 25 seconds. And he is closing on Lance Stroll. He will get his wish and use the soft tyres, then no, the hard? He was supposed to come in for a pit. “What is going on, he says?” “I don’t know, says the pit,” before giving him extra time to come in. 6270 Sainz overtakes Leclerc at last. “I am really struggling,” says Leclerc. It’s been a hard afternoon for the junior Ferrari partner. 6170 Hamilton is asked to come in. There is some discussion over tyres. Eventually, he deigns to what the garage ask him to do. Hard tyres v soft? Bottas set the fastest lap on hard. 6070 Sainz and Leclerc battle for tenth but the young Spaniard is held off. They will both hope for a better Ferrari car next season. 5970 Bottas is closing a little on Verstappen who got stuck in traffic. Are Mercedes getting ready for a pit for Hamilton? Not as yet. 5870 Bottas still has that fastest lap. But he is 1011 seconds short of Verstappen. Hamilton has a pit stop in hand. 5770 Hamilton has lapped much of the field, and his next target is Vettel in fifth. Don’t doubt that this is dominant. 5670 The front three less of procession than it looked. It may depend on the state of Verstappen’s car. Mercedes have been made to think. 5570 Hamilton told over the radio to step it up so he can have a new set of tyres, and perhaps he can set a fastest lap with them too, and thus take the championship lead. 5470 Hamilton may have one pit left, but may not need it. “The tyres don’t feel great,” he says. The pit will be a risk with Verstappen 22 seconds behind. Touch and go. 5370 It has been busy in the pit lanes. Stroll pits and comes out ahead of Vettel to hold fourth. 5270 Sainz closes on Leclerc. These two will be teammates next season so some pride to play for. Bottas sets a fastest lap again. 5170 The battle for tenth is an underpowered Sainz trying to take on Leclerc, who is struggling and has had an unhappy race with the decisions made on rubberwear. 5070 Bottas pits, puts on a compound tyre. Bottas has a pit on both Verstappen and Stroll and 20 laps to get into second. 4970 Still questions being asked about Albon’s dry start. There is talk of disqualification. That will have to wait for after the race, and perhaps later in the evening. 4870 Bottas right on Verstappen’s tail but then dropped back a bit. Magnussen is now having to hold off Leclerc. 4770 Verstappen getting a bit panicked over how close Bottas is getting to him. The complaint, as it was with Albon, is that the Red Bull doesn’t have enough power.

The changes were made without comment. In response to an email, Sullivan spokesman Mike Anderson wrote: “Senator Sullivan’s staff made a mistake trying to honor an American legend.”Lewis, a Democrat from Atlanta, was the last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists, led by Martin Luther King.He was best known for leading 600 protesters in the 1965 Bloody Sunday march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.

Doctors praised the study but cautioned it has yet to be formally reviewed by other scientists and that additional, detailed studies in other areas are urgently needed.The study also found patients from ethnic minorities were on average 10 years younger than the white patients, though the explanation for this is unknown. Age, frailty and underlying health conditions remain critical factors for all patients in determining the outcome of Covid-19.The study concluded: “Patients of black, Asian and minority ethnicity (BAME) are more likely to be admitted from regions of highest air pollution, housing quality and household overcrowding deprivation. This is likely to contribute an explanation towards the higher ITU admissions reported among Covid-19 BAME patients.”David Thickett, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Birmingham and one of the study team, said. “It’s no surprise that people living in poor areas and poor housing do badly in a pandemic. It’s been true since the Black Death and this reaffirms the importance of deprivation in influencing the pattern of disease.”A Public Health England report released in June showed a link between overall deprivation and worse coronavirus outcomes, but did not examine specific types of deprivation. At the time, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, rejected claims that “systemic injustice” was the reason for the disparities. There is also “compelling” evidence of an association between dirty air and coronavirus infections and deaths.Thickett said the public health message of the new study was better targeting of social distancing and handwashing advice to people in deprived areas and particularly those living in large households. “I don’t think there was very good engagement with ethnically erse populations, particularly in terms of language barriers,” he said.“The limitation of this study is that it’s in a single centre.” Thickett said. “What you really want is data from several different areas.” This research is being planned.Prof Stephen Holgate, the Royal College of Physicians’ special adviser on air quality, said: “This seems a strong study with appropriate methods used.” It suggests air pollution may be an important driver, he said.Dr Aarash Saleh, an NHS respiratory doctor and member of the Doctors Against Diesel campaign said: “We need more research like this to understand how air pollution interacts with other societal injustices to exacerbate health inequities, including death from Covid-19. Strategic responses to air pollution are urgently needed and must acknowledge and address the socioeconomic and racial intersections of this public health crisis.”The analysis used deprivation data from the English Indices of Deprivation 2019 report published by the government. This ides the country into 33,000 small areas, containing an average of 650 households. Among the seven measures of deprivation are “living environment”, which comprises air pollution, housing in poor condition and road traffic accidents.Air pollution and household overcrowding were already known to be associated with higher rates of community-acquired pneumonia and the worst air pollution levels are in neighbourhoods with a high population of minority ethnic residents. Thickett said the research was unlikely to explain why a disproportionate number of NHS staff from ethnic minorities had died from Covid-19: “That can’t just be due to deprivation, because they are at least in employment.”“Teasing out the inidual components is difficult,” said Prof Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary, University of London. He said the study was in line with his research showing exposure to air pollution increases the number of the ACE2 receptors that the coronavirus hijacks to enter the body.Dr Gilles de Wildt, a Birmingham GP, said: “Though the study is not yet peer reviewed, this is such an important area of research. We have all felt the clean air in Birmingham during the lockdown and know that emissions need to be curbed drastically for all health’s sake, not just Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408612a02022a0e6e37b7a8d6718c71a4387a81b/0_131_3219_1932/master/3219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=939e35ba2ea0ae25ed3d63ced5919afc","title":"eu leaders extra time tempers fray coronavirus recovery summit angela merkel emmanuel macron","story":"Orbán accuses Netherlands’ Rutte of ‘communist’ tactics on tense third day of talksHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, accused his Dutch counterpart of using the same methods as his country’s former communist leaders on Sunday, as EU leaders publicly clashed during tense and acrimonious negotiations over the terms of a proposed €1.8tn budget and recovery package for the bloc.A third difficult day of a summit of the EU’s 27 heads of state and government – the first in person for five months – saw movement towards agreement as talks stretched deep into the night, but laid bare the deep splits between north and south, and east and west.The leaders have been in intense debates over the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and the EU’s seven-year budget, known as the multi-financial framework, which is due to start next year.There are also stark differences over the nature of the conditions attached to the emergency funding and the balance between grants and loans on offer. The money will be borrowed from the capital markets by the European commission.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has insisted he cannot be expected to take on extra national debt in order for the EU to make cash payments to member states without his parliament having a say.In response, Orbán, the nationalist prime minister of Hungary, who was an anti-communist dissident in his youth, accused Rutte of aping Soviet methods to crush dissent by failing to properly set out the terms on which funds would be blocked.The Netherlands is seeking reassurance that commonly issued debt will be properly spent and wants the ability to hold back disbursements where there are governance concerns.“They would like to introduce a new mechanism that didn’t exist until now,” Orbán said to reporters, of the Dutch proposal for a country to be able to stop funding to member states undermining the rule of law. “I think it is questionable whether it has a basis in the treaty at all. I am coming from an ex-communist country. When the communist regime decided to attack us, they use unclarified legal terms exactly as the same as written in the proposal of the Dutch man … Saying ‘general deficiencies’. When I was arrested by the police and I asked them what I had done which is illegal, they say general deficiencies. What the fuck does it mean?”The row over the rule of law was dwarfed, however, by a more significant dispute over the size and form of the recovery fund, with “frugal” countries of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden defying France and Germany in trying to reduce the level of grants.EU diplomats said the four northern member states, to the evident frustration of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, were pushing to reduce the value of grants available from €500bn to €350bn while increasing the size of the rebates they currently have on their budget contributions. The whole recovery package would also be reduced to €700bn from the €750bn initially proposed by the European commission.Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said that in seven years attending of EU meetings, “I have never seen positions as diametrically opposed as this.”“The negotiations are difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult I have ever been involved in, yet the spirit of compromise has not yet disappeared,” tweeted Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš.The summit had been markedly bad-tempered from the first day on Friday, and its chairman, Charles Michel, the president of the European council, was forced to table a new set of proposals on Saturday morning in an attempt to reboot the talks.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Macron told reporters of his concerns about attempts to reduce the size of the recovery package, insisting there would not be a deal “made at the cost of European ambition”. Merkel had warned there was no guarantee of success.A second meeting has been pencilled in for the last week of July but there are concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections could stand in the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e472db3f372c4172c43006de1e5bd237a40f77/0_330_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b96a1dc9c26cf1a0b3bd279687c3f76","title":"three quarters uk support mandatory masks coronavirus","story":"Numbers opposed to this week’s move remain low, easing fears of culture warConcerns that the wearing of masks could become a new front in a political “culture war” have been eased after evidence emerged that a clear majority of the public back their use in shops and supermarkets.The findings follow complaints from some Conservative MPs after it was announced last week that masks will be compulsory in shops in England from this Friday, with a £100 fine for those who flout the law. One senior Tory said the use of masks was “absurd” and “only imposed for the convenience of the government”. Last week Tory MP Desmond Swayne said the order to wear a mask was a “monstrous imposition”, adding: “Nothing would make me less likely to go shopping than the thought of having to mask up.”Prominent rightwing commentators have also criticised the move, leading to some suggestions that mask-wearing would become as politically isive as it is in the US. But the new poll suggests such fears are overblown.Adam Drummond, associate director of Opinium, said: “The consistent trend of polling on public safety measures during the coronavirus crisis has been that the public are much more safety-first than we think and that complaints that public health measures trample on ancient sacred liberties are an extremely niche concern. Like the original lockdown measures, making masks mandatory in shops is seen as effective and reasonable, and is very popular with supporters of all parties.”The poll showed that the Conservative lead has widened to eight points over Labour, while approval of the government’s handling of Covid-19 has increased to a net -5, the best since mid-May.

I would hope that the leaders agree on something that’s ambitious rather than fast.”A financial aid package designed to lift Europe out of its deepest recession since the second world war hung in the balance at a summit on Sunday as leaders bickered over details for the third straight day, raising the risk that the package could be delayed or drastically watered down.Boris Johnson unveiled his plan to return England ‘to normality’ on Friday. Among a raft of measures is to allow employers to discuss with workers whether it is safe for them to return to the office from 1 August. Britain had a problem with a lopsided power relationship at work before the pandemic began. A new report from the Common Wealth thinktank published on Monday argues that a new settlement for work is needed to be at the heart of a fair recovery agenda to address these issues. Failure to rewrite the rules could lead to unscrupulous employers forcing their staff back without adequately addressing their concerns. Read the full story:The French government has announced that it will issue a €135-euro (£122) fine to people who flout its decree to wear a mask in indoor public spaces.Amid signs of an uptick in virus circulation, prime minister, Jean Castex, on Thursday said masks will become compulsory in enclosed public spaces from Monday in a bid to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections.Masks are already required on public transport, punishable with a fine of the same amount, in a country that has lost over 30,150 people to the epidemic.On Saturday, the health minister said the new obligation will apply to shops and supermarkets, covered fresh produce markets, banks and other establishments that receive members of the public.And on Sunday, the health department announced contraventions can be punished with a fine of up to €135 – almost double the price of a monthly Paris public transport pass.For people working in communal offices, the government has said employers will have to judge the need for mask-wearing on a case-by-case basis.France’s public health service noted over the weekend that the so-called R-number indicating the viral transmission rate has grown to over one, meaning that every infected person infects about 1.2 people in turn.According to the latest official data, released Wednesday, France had 119 new coronavirus patients hospitalised in 24 hours, down from a high of 4,281 people hospitalised in one day in April.The UK’s carbon emissions have begun to rebound following the easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures, causing the “carbon savings” triggered by the coronavirus to halve within weeks.Greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and transport industries climbed last month as more people returned to work, raising demand for fossil fuels from record lows in April when strict lockdown measures were in place, according to new data.My colleague Jillian Ambrose has the full report:Florida reported over 12,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, the fifth day in a row the state has announced an increase of more than 10,000 infections.The US’ virus death toll exceeded 140,000 earlier today. At least 14 states have reported record coronavirus hospitalisations so far in July, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Texas.In spite of these nationwide trends, the Trump administration is pushing for schools to reopen in a few weeks and resisting a federal mandate to wear masks in public.Failures of the government’s test-and-trace system are risking an exponential growth of coronavirus in hotspots across England, a director of public health has warned.Dominic Harrison, the director of public health in Blackburn with Darwen, said the national tracing system was only managing to reach half of those who had been in close contact with a coronavirus patient in towns with high infection rates in the north-west.My colleague Josh Halliday has the full report:The UK has recorded 27 more coronavirus deaths, bringing the total number of people who have died after testing positive to 45,300. Department of Health and Social Care data updated just before 4pm on Sunday also shows that a further 726 cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours. The total number of people who have tested positive stands at 294,792. These figures come after the government said on Saturday it would pause its daily updates on the coronavirus death toll amid growing concern that the number could have been exaggerated. Earlier today, NHS England announced that a further eight people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital. This brings the total number of confirmed deaths in English hospitals to 29,181.Nigeria’s foreign minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, says he has tested positive for Covid-19.Onyeama, 64, is the first member of President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet to contract the virus.He said in a tweet he had taken a Covid-19 test because of a throat irritation:Cuba has reported no new domestic cases of Covid-19 for the first time in 130 days, as most of the country moved into the final phase of resuming normal activities with masks and social distancing.Francisco Duran, head of epidemiology at the Ministry of Public Health, and who has updated the country daily on the pandemic, took off his mask during Sunday’s national broadcast to deliver the good news.Only a handful of Covid-19 cases were reported in Cuba over the last week, all in Havana. Most of the Caribbean island, home to 11.2 million inhabitants, has been free of the disease for more than a month.“I always tell you to stay safe at home, but I know many will go to the beach today,” Duran said, before reminding his television audience about social distancing.The capital’s 2.2 million residents remain at the first phase of three stages of reopening where they can once more move around on public and private transport, go to the beach and other recreation centres, and enjoy a seaside drive just in time for the summer break. They can also dine and have a drink.Social distancing and wearing masks remain mandatory in most circumstances.The country has opened a group of isolated resorts key to international tourism. Phase three broadens international travel, depending on risk.The communist-run country has been given high marks for its textbook handling of the pandemic.Cuba’s robust and free community-based health system, door-to-door search for carriers, isolation of the sick, suspected cases and contacts has allowed it to keep the number of infections under 2,500 with 87 deaths.Hello.

The biggest increases were reported in the US, Brazil, India and South Africa.As the global count of cases being tracked by Johns Hopkins University crossed 14m, with nearly 600,000 deaths, France announced that masks would be made mandatory in enclosed public spaces including banks, shops and indoor markets starting on Monday.• Coronavirus is spreading out of control in Hong Kong with a record 100 new cases confirmed, the territory’s leader said today, as she tightened social distancing measures to tackle the sudden rise in number of infections.While the city has had initially impressive success in tackling the disease, all but ending local transmissions by late June, infections have spiked in the last two weeks once more and doctors fear the new outbreak is now spreading undetected in the densely packed territory of 7.5 million people.• Donald Trump is seeking to block billions of dollars in funding for coronavirus testing and contact tracing efforts as cases spike across the US, where around 70,000 people are testing positive each day.White House opposition to spending proposed by Senate Republicans has sparked frustrations in his own party, according to the Washington Post, the New York Times and other media outlets.• The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has insisted he can avoid imposing another England-wide lockdown this winter, describing it as a “nuclear deterrent” that he hopes never to use.Despite chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance saying “national measures” might be necessary if there were fresh waves of the virus in the coming months, the prime minister said he “certainly” did not want to have to order the public to “stay at home” again.• Authorities in Australia are stepping up their battle against coronavirus with the second biggest city of Melbourne announcing the introduction of mandatory face coverings from Wednesday.The premier of the Australian state of Victoria said people in Melbourne, and the adjacent shire of Mitchell to its north, would have to wear a mask or a face covering from 11.59pm on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300324.1594304794!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another life the fox as he dwells among us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFox with prey: The urban adult is “thin and exhausted” from finding and ferrying food to its cubs. Illustration: Michael Viney Of the many surreal images in the iconography of lockdown, for me the most telling was the trotting fox on a shuttered, empty Grafton Street. There was something post-apocalyptic in the glimpse of this foraging, purposeful creature as the only sign of life.For many Dubliners, no doubt, the news video was no great surprise. “Everyone” knows there are foxes in dens in shrubberies near the Dáil. Dozens have had foxes playing on their lawns, chewing the kids’ toys and squatting among the roses. Urban foxes are an old story.Living on a hillside dotted with sheep and lambs, I no longer expect to meet Vulpes vulpes. “On well-run farms”, as Seamus Heaney wrote, “pests have to be kept down.”The last living fox I actually saw was running fast along the strand, closely harassed by a pair of magpies. Otherwise, the continuing local presence of the species lies in the fine tracks stitched along the tideline, pausing at a dead crab or plastic-strangled gannet.The ecological phenomenon of city foxes, however, remains new enough to warrant explanation and much study. As UCC mammalogist Paddy Sleeman put it recently on RTÉ: “Meeting a fox in a city is like meeting a friend in another country. It feels like the iniduals and surroundings don’t match.”How they all moved there and why is simple enough. Canals, railways and riverbanks were corridors to abundant food, from city rats and mice to garbage bags and pigeons. Grey squirrels, too, as Dr Sleeman mentions in their favour.But since foxes are predators, denning in the city’s green lacework of parks, gardens and undeveloped waste ground, their interactions with people, children and pets were bound to bring mixed responses.Dramatised fearOn one hand were fears and the odd incident, with the media ready to dramatise them. On the other were delighted encounters with “nature” and dishes of dog food put out on the lawn. Conflicts are as often between neighbours as from actual fox behaviour.Both the ecology of urban foxes and their relationships with humans have attracted abundant study, notably in the UK. As Stephen Harris has noted, “More papers have been published about foxes living in urban Britain than about those in any other habitat in the world.”Dr Harris, now retired from Bristol University, was a pioneer of research into the urban fox half a century ago, and has served as the animal’s leading scientific defender ever since. In a recent article for British Wildlife magazine, he again worked through the many “widely disseminated myths”.For a start, urban foxes have not grown any bigger or bolder than their rural cousins. With a shortage of the “larger food items” the countryside provides – the odd lamb, rabbit or ground-nesting bird – July finds the urban adults “thin and exhausted” from finding and ferrying food to their cubs.Do they attack pets? Surprisingly few, says Dr Harris. One of his studies in Bristol found they killed 8 per cent a year of pets kept outdoors, everything from poultry and rabbits to gerbils, goldfish and tortoises.Night patrolAs for attacking cats, “Of the thousands of interactions I have seen between foxes and cats, all the aggressive encounters were started by the cats.” On its nightly patrol a fox may encounter hundreds of cats, says Dr Harris. It ignores most of them, avoids the aggressive ones and is known to share a midnight snack with one at the leavings of a dog’s dish.What about human babies? He rejects the idea that foxes ever “attack” them, as sometimes dramatised by Britain’s tabloids. He agrees they can give rare bites, some with serious consequences, but suggests this arises through exploratory mouthing of little hands or legs while “investigating a strange object”. Hunting by sound rather than smell and thus not drawn by milk or dirty nappies, they may be attracted to investigate cots or prams by infant wails of distress.Like other wild mammals, foxes carry diseases and parasites, inviting fears of risk to the health of people or pets. “The latest scare”, as Dr Harris calls it, is the parasite he calls French heartworm, potentially fatal to dogs if left untreated. As I reported here in 2016, the UCD veterinary school was concerned by a sudden trebling in cases of dog “lungworm” (the parasite affects both heart and pulmonary arteries). In a massive sampling of 542 foxes, gathered from every county, it found the nematode in 40 per cent, more than double the rising UK figure.Dogs can pick it up through slugs or snails that have visited both garden fox droppings and dog dishes left outdoors overnight. Dr Harris is duly concerned for them, but points to the pulmonary distress of foxes as well.“Dogs and cats, not foxes,” he asserts, “ dominate the urban ecosystem and we are already seeing the impacts of their diseases on the health and welfare of urban foxes.”Dr Paddy Sleeman finds the public health risk intensifying European study. But he favours new approaches to health that consider “the entire ecosystem – people, domestic animals and wild animals all at the same time”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Countries face a rapid ageing of their populations which will place enormous strain on their societiesOne Change: From plastic bottles to paper bags, our huge reliance on throwaway items needs to changeNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recovery"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

It last year recommended an increase of 30 cent to the minimum wage for adults, bringing the rate to €10.10 per hour.The commission, established in 2015 to advise ministers on the issue, has an independent chairman appointed by the Government and involves trade unions, employers and campaign groups.It generally makes its recommendation about the national minimum wage level to the cabinet in July, which is then considered by government before a decision is announced in the budget in October.There was a political row last year after the then government proposed delaying the introduction of the increased national minimum wage – which generally comes into force in January – for a short period until there was greater clarity regarding Brexit and the ability of businesses to absorb an increase.The minimum wage is different to the living wage, which is the amount campaigners argue is the level of earnings required to provide an acceptable standard of living.Stay on top of the latest

Photograph: iStockBritish scientists analysing data from a widely-used coronavirus symptom-tracking app have found there are six distinct types of the disease, each distinguished by a cluster of symptoms.A King’s College London team found that the six types also correlated with levels of severity of infection, and with the likelihood of a patient needing help with breathing - such as oxygen or ventilator treatment - if they are hospitalised.The findings could help doctors to predict which Covid-19 patients are most at risk and likely to need hospital care in future waves of the epidemic.“If you can predict who these people are at Day Five, you have time to give them support and early interventions such as monitoring blood oxygen and sugar levels, and ensuring they are properly hydrated,” said Claire Steves, a doctor who co-led the study.Besides cough, fever and loss of smell – often highlighted as three key symptoms of Covid-19 – the app data showed others including headaches, muscle pains, fatigue, diarrhoea, confusion, loss of appetite and shortness of breath.The outcomes also varied significantly some got mild, flu-like symptoms or a rash and others suffered acute symptoms or died.The study, released online on Friday but not peer-reviewed by independent scientists, described the six Covid-19 types as: 1: ‘Flu-like’ with no fever: Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever.  2: ‘Flu-like’ with fever: Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite. 3: Gastrointestinal: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough. 4: Severe level one, fatigue: Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue. 5: Severe level two, confusion: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain. 6: Severe level three, abdominal and respiratory: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, abdominal pain.Patients with level 4,5 and 6 types were more likely to be admitted to hospital and more likely to need respiratory support, the researchers said.–Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308235.1595173036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk calls on eu countries to ensure britons living abroad can stay after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA British bar in Benidorm, Spain. Photograph: Jose JordanGettyAFPThe UK government is launching a multimillion pound communications campaign to reach the estimated 1 million British citizens living in the EU to ensure they know what steps to take if they wish to remain in their host countries after Brexit.And it is urging all EU member states to accelerate the process to enable British nationals to secure their rights amid concern among campaigners that some countries have not yet even opened schemes for UK citizens.“UK nationals living in the EU must be able to rely on the rights the withdrawal agreement gives them, just as EU nationals living in the UK can.“We continue to call on the EU and member states to protect the rights of UK nationals with faster implementation, longer application windows and clear communications, as the UK has done for EU citizens in the UK,” said a Foreign Office spokesperson.Their call comes weeks after the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, wrote to the vice-president of the European commission, Maroš Šefcovic, saying that while the UK had given EU citizens 27 months to apply for settled status, some EU member states were planning “short application windows that may not allow sufficient time for citizens to secure their rights”.The EU has confirmed that 13 countries, including France, where many British nationals live, have opted for a “constitutive” system similar to that in the UK requiring British nationals to apply for settled status.The remaining 14 member states have chosen the simpler “declaratory” system that allows British nationals to register their residency to demonstrate their right to continue to live, work or study in their chosen country.Spain, where an estimated 400,000 Britons live, has opted for the latter, giving campaigners hope that few will be left behind by the June 30th 2021 deadline for registration.It has also launched what local British campaigners are describing as a “warm” campaign, with the minister for inclusion, Hana Jalloul, telling Britons who want to remain that “this is, and always will remain your home”.It coincided with a joint statement with the British ambassador to remind Britons their rights are “guaranteed” if they are living there before December 31st.The country’s national statistics show 360,000 British nationals have already registered to be in the country with 104,000 living in the Andalucía province, including 62,000 in the costas around Malaga.Alicante and Valencia account for a further 97,000, with 40,000 and 29,000 in the Canaries and Balearics respectively.Sue Wilson, the founder of Bremain in Europe, a campaign group for Britons in Spain, said the fact that the Spanish government have chosen a simple declaratory scheme allowing rights to be “guaranteed” without an application for settled state a “great relief to British immigrants”.“We are grateful to the Spanish authorities for making the process as simple, seamless and painless as possible.”However, there is concern that there are tens of thousands of Britons who are off the radar, some elderly or vulnerable, and some who just don’t use the internet who may be more difficult to reach.The UK Foreign Office is working with three organisations in the country, including Age in Spain, with a big communications push to try to reach the over-65s around the Costas and Alicante.“I suspect a large number of people are out there who may not understand that there is an issue that they have to deal with because of Brexit, some of whom may not like to approach officials because they don’t know or fear how it might impact on things like taxation, health care,” said Helen Weir, the director of Age in Spain.Weir also said there was an important message to get out to relatives back in the UK. “If you have a relative in Spain who may not have residency or cannot cope with officialdom because they don’t speak Spanish or because they can’t cope with bureaucracy, you can contact Age in Spain and we can put them in touch with people who can help.”Of the 26 member states (Ireland is an exception, with British and Irish having reciprocal rights to remain in each others country after Brexit), Spain is considered one of the most advanced in preparations for the human cost of Brexit.France was due to open its application process on July 1st but has put it back to October because of Covid-19 and pressure will mount on countries to extend the deadlines for applications beyond June 30th next year to accommodate the challenges caused by the pandemic.So far, 14 countries, including Italy, Sweden and Portugal, have extended the deadline for British people to register or apply for settled status until October next year. -

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"los angeles mayor says city brink second lockdown","story":"The mayor of Los Angeles warned on Sunday that the city is on the brink of a return to lockdown, as coronavirus cases in the United States continue to surge and the White House blocks chunks of a $75 billion pandemic plan.Eric Garcetti, mayor of the second-largest city in the United States, said a stay-at-home order would likely come at the state or county level. Los Angeles County reported 2,770 new cases and 37 more deaths on Saturday, bringing its total to 153,041 cases and 4,084 fatalities, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide the US has more than 3.7 million cases, and 140,000 deaths, almost a quarter of the 600,000 deaths worldwide..Mr Garcetti was asked on CNN what went wrong in California, which initially escaped the onslaught of the pandemicHe blamed a lack of national leadership and said that people became exhausted by lockdown restrictions.They were sold a bill of goods. They said this was under control. They said this would be over soon. And I think when leaders say that, people react. And they do the wrong things. They stop distancing themselves. They stop washing their hands. They stop wearing masks, he said.We know this will be a marathon, he continued.  Stop telling people this will be over soon. Let people know that this is a marathon, that we have to kind of push through every single mile. And if we don\u0027t come together as a nation with national leadership, we will see more people die.His remarks came amid reports that Donald Trump is trying to block billions of dollars in spending on coronavirus testing and contact tracing, and on efforts to combat the pandemic.Republicans were in talks with the president\u0027s team over the weekend to finalise a $75.5 billion (£60bn) plan by Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, to fight the virus.Mr McConnell is preparing to unveil his plan this coming week, as part of negotiations with Democrats on what will likely be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the November election. A $3 trillion plan approved by the Democrat-controlled House in May was declared dead on arrival in the Republican-held Senate.Yet sources told The Washington Post that the talks had stalled.Senate Republicans intended to allocate $25 billion in grants to states for conducting testing and contact tracing, as well as about $10 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and about $15 billion for the National Institutes of Health. They had also proposed providing $5.5 billion to the State Department and $20 billion to the Pentagon to help counter the virus and potentially distribute a vaccine at home and abroad.But in talks over the weekend, administration officials instead wanted to reduce to zero the funding for testing and tracing, with White House officials insisting that they have already approved billions of dollars in assistance for testing and that some of that money remains unspent.The officials also wanted slash to zero the funding allocated for the nation’s top health agencies, and to cut the Pentagon funding to $5 billion, according to another person familiar with the discussions.The White House\u0027s demands are putting the Republicans in a difficult position. They have strongly opposed the Democrat suggestion, and need to come up with their own alternative.The United States is still deeply mired in the fight against COVID-19.On Saturday, more than 61,000 coronavirus cases were announced, according to a New York Times database. Cases this week were increasing in 41 states, and the CDC expects half the country - 24 states - to see a surge in deaths in the next four weeks.It\u0027s going to disappear, and I\u0027ll be right, the president told Fox News on Sunday, when asked about his June prediction that it would  just disappear.I\u0027ve been right probably more than anyone else, he said.Testing in the United States has increased by 37 per cent, but the number of confirmed cases has increased by 194 per cent. The number of weekly tests reported nationwide has increased to more than five million in early July from about one million in early April, according to data collected by the Covid Tracking Project. It isn\u0027t just that testing has gone up it\u0027s that the virus has spread, the interviewer pointed out.On Saturday The New York Times published a damning report into dysfunction within the White House coronavirus task force, and claims that the head of the group, Dr Deborah Birx, was providing the president with overly-optimistic reports, to try and appease him.Dr Birx believed that the US, according to statistical models, was on course to follow the coronavirus path set by Italy, and peak in April before tapering away.While her counterpart Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the Center for Infectious Diseases, was more cautious, and was greeted with hostility, Dr Birx provided a sunnier outlook which pleased the president.Unlike Dr Fauci, who only stopped by the White House to attend meetings, she was given an office near the Situation Room and freely roamed the West Wing, fully embracing her role as a member of the president’s team.Mr Trump and his team convinced themselves that the outbreak was fading, that they had given state governments all the resources they needed to contain its remaining “embers” and that it was time to ease up on the lockdown. Not until early June did White House officials even begin to recognise that their assumptions about the course of the pandemic had proved wrong, the paper reported.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uffizi criticised comparing botticellis venus instagram influencer","story":"Florence\u0027s Uffizi Gallery has been accused of dumbing itself down after comparing a social media influencer to Botticelli\u0027s Birth of Venus.Chiara Ferragni, who has millions of followers on social media, posed in front of some of the most highly regarded Renaissance masterpieces, including Sandro Botticelli\u0027s Birth of Venus, sparking criticism that great art was being used as a mere backdrop for Instagram pictures.The Uffizi has enthusiastically embraced social media, using TikTok to present irreverent clips involving some of its most famous works.In its official Instagram post, the Uffizi Gallery compared the Renaissance’s prototype of “blonde-haired woman with diaphanous skin” - embodied by Botticelli’s Venus - to Ferragni, calling her “a sort of contemporary inity in the social era.”The comparison irritated many of the Uffizi’s traditional fans, who said the museum was reducing itself to a set, shifting the attention from its masterpieces. Ferragni visited the museum during a photo shoot for the fashion magazine Vogue.Eike Schmidt, the gallery\u0027s director, defended the initiative, saying it was part of the museum’s more “democratic” strategy to attract a wider and younger audience by using social media.   Mr Schmidt noted that the museum’s post received 2,000 negative reactions, but also 30,000 likes in just 24 hours.“The Uffizi don’t need Chiara Ferragni, and she doesn’t need the Uffizi,” Schmidt said in an interview with Italian daily La Repubblica on Sunday. “The important thing is to create a cross-over, to spark a dialogue.”Mr Schmidt has been credited with successfully renewing the museum’s image and helping it make more money.But the museum, as many other cultural landmarks, faces a dramatic fall in the numbers of international visitors due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.   Italy’s tourism industry amounts to 13 per cent of the country’s output, but it has been brought to its knees by lockdown measures and travel restrictions imposed to contain the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke culture isnt laughing matter must stopped late","story":"“Woke” culture is often seen as a joke, but it is changing our country for the worse. We need to stop complaining, and start taking action against it.There are three main things we should do. First, fighting the forces of identity politics – a mentality which refuses to treat people as iniduals and promotes new forms of sectarianism. Take Pran Patel, the founder of “decolonise the curriculum,” who claimed: “Priti Patel is the perfect example of whiteness inhabiting a different coloured vessel”.The public sector cannot – wittingly or unwittingly – promote such ideas, as it does by lumping together non-white minorities under the umbrella term “Black and Minority Ethnic” in official publications. Woke warriors like this isive framing because it creates a sense of “them and us” white people versus everyone else.It’s also unhelpful, concealing important variations we need to understand to improve things. The employment rate among Indian men is higher than among white British, while for Pakistani and Bangladeshi men it’s a little lower. Asian pupils are more likely to get five good GCSEs than white, black pupils less likely. An average for “BAME” conceals these things. And people feel connections to real places, not a sociologist’s acronym. I have constituents who’d say they’re British-Punjabi or Gujarati. They wouldn’t say they’re BAME.Though numerous bestsellers promote this isive new politics, public sector bodies should not be regurgitating their messages. One Sheffield headmaster recently wrote to parents: “Our society is built upon white supremacy.” Apartheid South Africa was such a society. Britain is not. Schools have no business pushing this rubbish – and the Government must issue guidance to that effect. Mandatory “unconscious bias training” is also widespread in the public sector, despite the poor scientific evidence for its effectiveness: it may even be counterproductive.A second aspect of the woke revolution we must resist is its assault on free speech. We are importing American “cancel culture”, in which people may be harassed or sacked for tiny deviations from new orthodoxies. The author JK Rowling writes thoughtfully on transgender issues, recently critiquing the use of the term “people who menstruate,” rather than “women.” Immediately, this triggered accusations of “transphobia”, numerous authors quit her agency, and staff at her publisher refused to work on her new book. One author was sacked from her contract simply for tweeting “I stand with JK Rowling.”Fuelled by social media, cancel culture is accelerating. Last week a bureaucrat at the Environment Agency cancelled an event with the independent mayor of Middlesbrough who had said: “Don’t listen to careless talk in the media about white privilege … Deprivation here appears to be colour blind.”To fight back, employment law may need to change to protect free speech. Of course, firms should be able to fire people who do racist or sexist things. But firms and public sector bodies must respect employment law and free expression. We particularly need to defend free speech in our universities, where cancel culture is most powerful.Third, we need to counter the excessively negative view of British history that is being pushed on young people. Someone recently spray-painted “racist” on a statue of Churchill, a shameful consequence of this unbalanced view of the past. Liverpool University is renaming buildings named after the great Liberal reformer Gladstone, merely because his father owned slaves. There’s good and bad in our history, but balance has gone out the window.Let’s turn the conversation about slavery and statues towards something forward-looking. Let’s fight slavery today, with a commission on modern slavery to work in the run up to the 200th anniversary of the Slavery Abolition Act in 2033. Priti Patel is working with France to fight the trafficking gangs smuggling people across the Channel. But more is needed. Let’s clamp down even harder on sweatshops in Britain. Let’s hold to account western companies which benefit, disgracefully, from the slave labour of Uighur Muslims in China.Perhaps we should make the Queen’s birthday a national holiday. Many other countries have national service: let’s replace National Citizen Service with something much bigger.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus infection rate in England is five-times greater than that of Scotland’s, the latest data has revealed.Since mid-May, both countries have seen new daily coronavirus cases reduce significantly, though Scotland’s handling of the virus appears to have been far more effective.At their peak, both nations recorded a similar amount of new cases per day, with England recording around 73 new cases per million people compared to Scotland’s 63 infections per million people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut while Scotland’s rate of new Covid-19 cases has fallen consistently below two per million since late June, England’s is yet to drop below seven per million.The latest figures, taken from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, come after Nicola Sturgeon said she would “not shy away” from imposing quarantine restrictions on visitors from England.Scotland\u0027s more rapidly declining number of new daily coronavirus cases means that the difference between the two nation\u0027s infection rates has grown wider.Since mid May, England\u0027s infection rate compared to Scotland\u0027s rose from around 1.4-times greater, to more than 7-times greater by mid July. It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former Labour-supporting areas in the north of England which voted Conservative in the last general election are at a greater risk from the root causes of obesity a new analysis has shown.The work by the Health Foundation comes as ministers are expected to unveil the government’s obesity strategy this week and suggests the “red wall” areas have higher rates of childhood obesity, more fast food outlets and generally suffer worse deprivation.The Health Foundation has warned the government must not continue with a failed approach of targeted single interventions and instead focus on wider inequalities and factors that lead people into living unhealthy lives, what are known as the social determinants of health inequalities.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrime minister Boris Johnson has reportedly been trying to lose weight and get healthier following his coronavirus infection that left him fighting for his life. Politically, Mr Johnson has been opposed to state interventions in people’s personal lives and it had been hoped his new attitude would change the government’s policies on so-called “sin-taxes”.Adam Tinson, senior analyst at the Health Foundation, told The Independent: “There are worrying signs that the prime minister has still not grasped the full extent of the challenge facing the country and its seriousness. The policies that have been trailed ahead of the expected strategy on obesity, suggest that the government may continue its approach of pursuing isolated policies that, on their own, will have little impact on levels of obesity.”According to an analysis based on election results by ward, Public Health England’s National Child Measurement Programme and density of fast food outlets in local areas, the Health Foundation says red wall areas could stand to lose out the most if the obesity strategy fails to tackle wider population level issues.It said people’s exposure to the multiple causes of obesity was not the same across the country. Residents living in red wall seats live close to fast food outlets and off licenses than compared with traditional Conservative-held seats.Conservative areas tend to have on average 77 fast food outlets per 100,000 people compared with 114 in red wall areas that voted Tory in the last election.Those seats also have higher rates of childhood obesity, seeing larger increases over the last decade compared to Tory seats. Rates of obesity for year six children, aged 10-11, increased 2.1 per cent on average compared to 0.5 per cent in Tory areas.In 2018-19, one in five children aged 10-11 were classed as obese.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Tinson added: “‘A credible obesity strategy must reflect the evidence that our health is strongly influenced by the circumstances in which we live which shape whether we can be active or eat healthily.“It must also acknowledge poverty and inequality as root causes of obesity and recommend action on these fronts. The health of children in the most deprived areas of the country is at risk and this is especially true for the so-called red wall areas that lent the government their votes in the last election.“It isn’t too late for the government to listen to the evidence and act decisively. Many of the practical solutions are not new. Policies like providing safe cycling and walking routes, restricting adverts for unhealthy food, banning sales of energy drinks to under-16-year-olds, and – as is currently proposed – limiting supermarket promotions of unhealthy food, enjoy broad public support. Several have been included in the government’s previous childhood obesity plans but not implemented, losing out to competing commercial interests.”Health secretary Matt Hancock has made prevention of ill-health a core part of his strategy at the Department of Health and Social Care.A prevention green paper published in July last year did include a childhood obesity strategy and policies to end the sale of energy drinks to children and changes to food labelling.A Soft Drinks Industry Levy was launched in April 2018 which led to companies reducing the average sugar content of drinks subject to the levy by almost 30 per cent between 2015 and 2018.Department of Health and Social Care\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 60 per cent of the world’s children are still out of school, with closures having peaked at 91 per cent in April.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDespite these grim forecasts, the Multidimensional Poverty Index 2020‘s authors write that “the firm hope is that this will not happen”, and that instead “progress is possible”.Professor Sabina Alkire, co-creator of the index – which is used by countries and experts across the world as a measure to gauge and help reduce poverty levels – told The Independent in May that she believed the pandemic could bring about a “historic reduction” in global poverty, if authorities are “strategically pro-poor” with emergency funding and recovery measures.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyProf Alkire, director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, pointed to economist Amartya Sen’s observations that life expectancy in the UK rose far more quickly during the Second World War than in the previous decade – which he attributed largely to emergency food-rationing systems.Published this week, the 2020 index also shows that of the 75 countries studied, Sierra Leone saw the fastest reduction in multidimensional poverty, at a time when the country was grappling with the Ebola crisis.In the four years from 2013, multidimensional poverty – a measure of whether people experience multiple deprivations in health, education and standards of living – fell sharply from 74 per cent to 58 per cent, with the provision of electricity and clean cooking fuel bringing about the largest changes.“As terrible as the tragedy was, it did not create a widespread slide into poverty,” the report states. “Public health emergencies require fast responses, and human error as well as tragedy seem inevitable.“Despite this, Sierra Leone shows that it is possible to reduce the interlinked deprivations of multidimensional poverty during an epidemic.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe report, which looks back on the progress made in the decade since the index was created, also found that 65 of the 75 countries studied has “significantly” reduced levels of multidimensional poverty.In India, which saw the largest reduction, some 273 million people moved out of multidimensional poverty during the past decade, according to the report.Some 70 million people in China left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014. In Bangladesh, numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Before the pandemic, 47 countries were on track to halve poverty between 2015 and 2030, if observed trends continued. But 18 countries, including some of the poorest, were off track.Of the 1.3 billion people living in multidimensional poverty, more than 80 per cent are deprived in at least five of the ten indicators used, the report states.Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of giving \u0027dodgy answers\u0027 on child poverty claimHalf of the world’s multidimensionally poor – around 644 million – have not yet turned 18 years old.At least 40 per cent live in south Asia, and an even greater proportion live in sub-Saharan Africa. However, in addition to Sierra Leone, six other sub-Saharan African countries are counted among the top 10 fastest-improving countries, alongside Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe.Some 107 million suffering multiple vulnerabilities are over the age of 60, which researchers flagged as “a particularly importantly figure during the Covid-19 pandemic”.“Covid-19 is the latest crisis to hit the globe, and climate change all but guarantees more will follow soon. Each will affect the poor in multiple ways,” Pedro Conceicao, director of the UNDP’s Human Development Report Office, said in a statement. “More than ever, we need to work on tackling poverty – and vulnerability to poverty – in all its forms.” Prof Alkire said: “The MPI – with its information on both the level and composition of poverty – provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself. Otherwise policymakers are flying blind, unable to know how – or where – to target resources and interventions.”She added: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape.

So I will join in working for it. But there may also be no result today.”EU leaders fail to agree in ‘grumpy’ budget and coronavirus fund talksMeanwhile, Austria’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz said a deal was possible but there was still “a way to go” at the summit.Disagreements remain over the size of the fund and the split between grants and repayable loans, with countries such as the Netherlands trying to limit the use of grants.The talks, which some fear could be a “make-or-break” moment for the bloc, have underscored the gulf between the EU’s north and south and raised serious questions about the viability of the union.A 1.8-trillion-euro (£1.6 trillion) package for the EU’s next long-term budget and a recovery fund to haul Europe out of its deepest recession since World War Two are on the table at the summit.The proposed 750-billion-euro recovery fund, which is to be raised on capital markets by the EU\u0027s executive European Commission, would be funnelled mostly to hard-hit Mediterranean rim countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the talks fail to reach a conclusion on Sunday, they could run into Monday or lead to another summit later in July.One contentious issue in the talks is a proposed new rule-of-law mechanism which could freeze funding to countries flouting democratic principles.Hungary, backed by its eurosceptic ally Poland, has threatened to veto the package over the rule-of-law mechanism, which is supported by the Netherlands.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte’s position has been informed by political difficulties in his country, where voters have objected to the Netherlands being, proportionately, among the largest net contributors to the EU budget.Mr Rutte and his conservative VVD party are also facing a strong challenge from far-right eurosceptic parties in elections next March.Viktor Orban, Hungary’s far-right prime minister, has claimed the Dutch leader has a personal grudge against him.“I don\u0027t know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he is attacking so harshly,” Mr Orban told reporters.“I don\u0027t like blame games but the Dutchman is the real responsible man for the whole mess.”On Saturday, Ms Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron walked out of heated talks with the so-called frugal countries.The two leaders have refused to water down their proposals for aid and objected to plans for the level of free grants in the package to fall below 400 billion euros.Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s prime minister, had earlier accused the Netherlands and its allies, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, of “blackmail” in the talks.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things. It’s more important than ever now to show that women can support each other and hold each other up.”But there is one person for whom Gemma will always open her purse – her mum Joan.The reality star, left, said: “I like to treat her. I am massively independent and I do like to pay my own way.” Thinking out loud on her BBC Radio  podcast, Gemma mused: “Could we ever get rid of money “I don’t think we could. What would we replace it with “I quite like chocolate buttons, so I’d be happy to replace it.”Might get a bit messy in the summer, Gem.THEY say birds of a feather stick together and it seems models do too – as Cara Delevingne and Kaia Gerber look inseparable at a Black Lives Matter rally.Kaia wrapped her arms around Cara, and strolled with her, as they listened to motivational speakers at the event in Calornia, which was attended by thousands.Despite the nine-year age gap, the pair palled up after meeting on the fashion circuit. Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King. Thank you for all the light, strength and joy you have brought into my le. I feel capable of anything with you by my side.”The pair are believed to have been dating since last year.Jonathan, who hails from the Congo, is the first man she has publicly dated after splitting from rapper HYPO in .Before that she was married to scientist Adam Gouraguine but they split after ten years, just a year after tying the knot.Jonathan headed up a community centre with recording studio in Chad-well Heath, North London, to give kids skills to stay out of gangs. It shut in February after two years.Hopefully he and Emeli last far longer than that.BOYZONE split up for good before the release of their  album and the subsequent tour last year . . . or so they said. But they might already be having second thoughts.Keith Duffy has teamed up with ex-Westle star Brian McFadden to release an album as Boyz-Le, and Brian reckons it’s only a matter of time before Boyzone are back too. He said: “It’s  years since I left Westle so, for me, rejoining won’t happen. But for Boyzone . . . the boys have been together for  years.“Though Keith and I are doing this and Ronan Keating is doing his solo thing,the opportunity comes up for the boys to get together – there is going to be a -year anniversary in a few years – you can never say never.”With  No singles between the two bands, Keith and Brian had plenty of options when picking songs for their Strings Attached album, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which is out today.Keith said: “It made it very easy, the fact we had so many No singles to choose from. You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength. We’ve moved mountains.“We’re pinching ourselves to be given this opportunity again in our ­forties to get on stage.”POP fans would have been in for a shockthey had bumped into this trio in the park.THE Saturdays members Frankie Bridge, Una Healy and Mollie King shared the photo on their catch-up, six years on from their split.I guess their absent bandmates Vanessa White and Rochelle Humes were taking their social- distancing really seriously.MEGAN THEE STALLION is “grateful to be alive” after being shot in the foot at a party at the weekend. The rapper, who collaborated with Beyonce on a remix of her song Savage, said she was taken to hospital by police, where she had an op to remove the bullets after the “traumatic” incident.CONGRATS to Radio  DJ Chris Stark, who has become a dad for a second time. Announcing the news on air yesterday, he said: “I am so happy, I’m so proud and I’m so pleased. Our little baby boy was born and it’s just mad. It’s the best. My we is just phenomenal.”GIGI HADID is trying to “document” every step of her pregnancy. The model, who is expecting her first child with Zayn Malik, said: “I’m just taking my time with sharing my pregnancy . . . I’m trying to document it well. Right now, I just want to experience it and don’t want to worry about having to look cute or post.”CLEAN BANDIT have racked up a billion Spoty streams of their  Christmas No Rockabye.

But most accept we have to leave our homes and get back to the workplace to save the economy.About one in five —  per cent — think it is unsafe toto work and want to continue working from home. A similar number,  per cent, argue it is probably safe to go back.But crucially, a massive  per cent accept it is worth the risk of travelling back to their office to protect their jobs and livelihood.The boost for BoJo’s attempt to reawaken our towns and cities comes in our YouGov poll to mark the first anniversary of his Premiership.It also reveals:Last night senior Tories said Mr Johnson should continue hammering home his back-to-work message to ease the nation’s deep-seated virus fears.Tory ex-minister Sir Mike Penning said: “This poll shows that the penny is beginning to drop about the wider impact of coronavirus.“It’s understandable that people are still concerned about becoming infected, but as we come out of lockdown many are starting to contemplate the economic backlash that is about to hit us.“If we want to keep people in work and protect our vibrant towns and cities, we’ve got to go back to work and get the country moving again.”However, most people think a second wave of coronavirus infections is inevitable, with eight out of ten predicting a sharp rise this autumn.And some MPs fear the Government’s success in persuading Brits to stay at home has made the task of getting them to go back to work even tougher.Half of adults say they will not visit a restaurant next month to take advantage of the Chancellor’s half-price meal deal.

To lead a nation when you have nearly died yourself is an astonishing achievement in itself.“It’s been tough, but give him credit. He has bounced back and I think Britain will bounce back, too.”Most people think BoJo should lead his party into the next general election, with  per cent of Tories still believing he is the best bet.But Mr Sunak’s star is rising fast, after only five months in the Cabinet. An overwhelming  per cent of people believe he has done a good job of handling the impact of the pandemic with his furlough and business support schemes.And he is leading the race to succeed Boris by a country mile with  per cent of voters saying he would be their first choice —  points ahead of his nearest rival Dominic Raab.Mr Sunak is even more popular among Tory voters, with  per cent saying he would make the best PM out of all potential runners.While Mr Johnson marks his first anniversary on Friday, millionaire Sir Keir has just chalked up his first  days as Labour chief.Most people think he has done well, shown himself to be a strong leader and looks like a potential PM.But they are almost equally split when askedhe is either interesting or boring — orhe has been clear about what he stands for.The YouGov poll of , adults also found widespread support for the Government’s decision to remove Huawei from Britain’s G network, with  per cent in favour.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I think the advice thats gone out is any changes need to be properly documented and it shouldnt affect your credit score, he said in March.In the same month, Jonathan Westley, chief data officer at credit agency Experian said customers wouldnt suffer by stopping payments.Many lenders are offering payment holidays or other arrangements to help people who have been affected by the outbreak, he said.A mortgage industry source reportedly said banks were questioning peoplethey had taken a payment holiday.Another source reportedly said: Its reasonable that people looking to remortgage, or switch their mortgage will be askedthey have maintained payments orthey have missed any payments.Inidual lenders might look at that in a negative way as a potential new borrower. They will say, Well, this person chose to take a payment holiday, did they do it because they needed one, or because they were lazy  That person might be less of a good risk than someone who continued paying their mortgage regardless.MP Siobhain McDonagh, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said banks should step up and live by their promises.If they promised it wouldnt have an impact on your credit-worthiness, you generally expect the Government to tell the truth, she said.When the banks werent processing loans to businesses, the Government was certainly in a position to put pressure on the banks, and youd hope they do that for inidual homeowners. A UK Finance spokesperson said lenders should lend responsibly, while a Treasury spokesperson said: The FCA has been clear that payment holidays should not have a long-term impact on peoples credit rating – and that where additional help is needed, lenders must be clear about the possible implications.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: I donapost believe in this story at all, there is no sense in it. He added I learned about theirexistence from British media. In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible. The row blew up just days before the newly formed parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee prepares to release the long-awaited report into Russian interference in UK politics drawn up by its predecessor committee in the last parliament. The three Western allies claimed on Thursday that a group of hackers, known as the Dukes or Cozy Bear - with links to Russian intelligence, had targeted research bodies around the world - including in the UK.At the same time, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Russian actors had tried to interfere in last yearaposs general election by amplying stolen government papers online. The documents - relating to US-UK trade talks - were picked up by then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who said they were evidence the Conservatives were preparing to open up the NHS to US pharmaceutical companies.However in an interview with BBCaposs The Andrew Marr show, to be screened on Sunday, Mr Kelin his country had no interest in interfering in British domestic politics.  I do not see any point in using this subject as a matter of interference, he said. We do not interfere at all. We do not see any point in interference because for us, whether it will beConservative Party or Labouraposs party at the head of this country, we will try to settle relations and to establish better relations than now. Asked whether he had watched UK drama aposThe Salisbury Poisoningsapos, Mr Kelin said he had only seen a few minutes of it, but had to stop watching because it was so dull. Mr Raab said the UK will make sure the world knows the nature of the reprehensible behaviour that Russia is engaged in. He told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge programme: Weaposre absolutely confident that the Russian intelligence agencies were engaged in a cyber attack on research and development efforts and organisations in this country and internationally with a view either to sabotage or to profit from the RD that was taking place. And I think the point is first of all weaposve seen this as part of a wider systematic approach to cyber taken by Russia and at the time that the world is coming together to try and tackle Covid-, particularly come up with a global solution for a vaccine, I think itaposs outrageous and reprehensible that the Russian Government is engaged in this activity. So what weaposre doing with our allies is making sure people know, making sure the organisations know so that they can better defend against it, but also just calling Russia out, we will do this. Now you will see us holding Russia to account and making sure that the world knows the nature of the reprehensible behaviour that theyaposre engaged in.

In , Alan and Christine Tait fled their west Wales home and have yet to go back after being spooked by the noises they heard. More than a year ago, WalesOnline were invited to enter what appeared to be an unremarkable house in the centre of the small town.The house - located in Camarthenshire, down an alleyway - is hidden away from the hustle and bustle.But what thrust this house into the centre of a mystery was not the sounds coming from everyday le in a town centre street, but the sounds that, according to its owners, were coming from beneath. Screaming, crying, swearing. The voices of men, women and children, apparently coming from underneath the basement. The owners have fled, and have not been at the property they own for more than two years. They’re too afraid to go back, convinced that a criminal gang have been running a subterranean enterprise just yards beneath their kitchen. It all started in June , when Alan and Christine Tait heard strange noises while up late one evening. The making of a late-night coffee started a chain of events that has made national news, inspired radio discussions, and led to police officers attending the house. Mr and Mrs Tait started to record what they could hear. “It was like a flushing noise that I heard first,” said Mrs Tait, “then we could hear a machine running, and we started to record all over the house, picking up the sounds of chains, a motorbike starting, and people screaming.” Mr Tait went further. He dug two . metre channels into the walls of his basement and furnished them with recording equipment. He heard “a woman screaming, sexual sounds, dogs barking, a printing press running, a motorbike, a car horn honking and what sounds like a police siren”.A year later, in June , WalesOnline sent a reporter to the house  to investigate. The owners did not go with him, preferring instead to stay well clear. They sent us a key and our reporter made his way inside.A recording devicewas placed next to a small entrance to the basement and left to run for several hours. It did not pick up anything sinister, only the sounds of the reporter leaving the house to head to the shop. However, Mr and Mrs Tait had already at that point captured recordings taken further down, or nearer to the habitat of the “serious criminal gang” who they believe reside underground. Those are the recordings that have now been listened to by thousands of people since the story was covered and subsequently picked up by national news outlets more than a year ago. So what has happened since then to Mr and Mrs Tait  They left the house in June , and now, more than two years later, they are in the north of England, living in a mobile home. They continue to travel around, moving from place to place, trying to raise awareness of what they believe is going on in Ammanford. “We have a number of supporters who have been in touch with us, and one has been to the house several times and made hours and hours of recordings which also picked up similar noises,” revealed Alan Tait. “The main dference is that the machine noises are quieter, but you can still hear the voices, you can still hear the screaming. “Those recordings were made on July  last year and again on December . It has to be the case I picked up the noises in  and someone , totally independently, picked up similar noises a year later and  months later.” Since last summer, Mr Tait has appeared on an online radio channel called HPANWO radio, which looks at and discusses, among other things, government cover-ups, ghosts, UFOs and paranormal investigations. Mr Tait does not believe the goings-on in west Wales come from another world, or that they stem from some paranormal beings it’s something much closer to home, something much more real than that. “Speaking about it with others helps to get the message out, and a lot of people are certainly curious about it,” he said.

As he approaches his seventh birthday on Wednesday, George shows he’s just like any other kid when it comes to having fun. From blowing bubbles to building dens, he is full of energy. A snap of him rolling around in the grass in his England shirt, taken by his mum Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to ­celebrate his sixth birthday shows his allegiance to the beautul game. From the moment his first baby pictures ­appeared with his ­parents and their spaniel Lupo, Prince William and Kate’s eldest has enthralled the world. Dubbed Curious George, he is not shy of the camera, from his first balcony ­appearance at  months when he waved at a Red Arrows flypast, to the moment he pressed his nose to a plane window on an official trip. William once dubbed George “a little bit of a rascal” but there was no sign of his boisterous side as he cuddled up to his sister Charlotte after her birth in .  She quickly mastered the royal wave but big brother George refused to play ball when he visited new arrival Prince Louis after his birth in . And it seems George is clearly boss. When the duchess was asked why he wasn’t on the royal tour of India in , she joked: “He’s too naughty. He would be running all over the place.” Just like any other little boy, then.  Prince Georgeaposs godmother recently revealed the heartwarming gt-giving tradition she does for the young royal each birthday. Julia Samuel borrowed the sweet idea from her pal Princess Diana and has a special surprise in store for Georgeaposs seventh birthday on July .  Ms Samuel, , was a long-time friend of Diana and is godmother to both Prince William and George. She described how she buys aposimpossibleapos toys for the family that William then spends days attempting to put together with cautious assembling.Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making.  “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficult is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George.  Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added. Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.Ms Samuel added that George is amazing — Heaposs funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much, she said.  That is heartbreaking for all of them. The podcast was released on July , on what would have been Princess Dianaaposs th birthday. Ms Samuel also said her favorite memory of the royal was her laugh.Therapist Ms Samuel was forced to apologise on TV earlier this year as she promoted a new book on ITVaposs Lorraine. She turned the air blue and said a rude word while speaking about how people can cope while having a bad day. Ms Samuel said: You would go to your friend, aposI’m having a s***e week,” I’m not sleeping, Iaposm furious with so and so I did a terrible show, something, something, somethingapos.

They said: We note the Government’s decision on face coverings on shops and public transport where it is harder to keep social distancing in place. However, we also support the Government’s consideration that there need to be practical requirements for each sector. As such, when it comes to gyms and leisure centres, the appropriate mitigation measures will be in place to make sure that social distancing remains.

Baby Forrest Gardiner was revived in mum Abbey Gardineraposs arms after she was born at  weeks, weighing just lb oz, two days before lockdown. Her miraculous story of survival comes after she spent  days in intensive care and nine weeks on a ventilator, suffering a string of le threatening conditions and four collapsed lungs. Little Forrest was born with no toenails or fingernails and her eyes were still fused together. Her skin, paper thin and translucent, she was kept in a plastic bag. Dad Keri Gardiner, , first met his daughter five weeks after her birth, on the day he also had to watch doctors perform CPR on her. She was later pronounced dead having contracted a deadly condition but doctors miraculously revived her as the nation sheltered from Covid-. This week, Forrest arrived home to meet her siblings Chadley Bees, five, and Hunnibelle Gardiner, four, for the first time after fighting for her le in three hospitals across South Wales. Mum Abbey Coburn, , from Porth in South Wales, said: I donapost think they actually believed me when I said she was coming home. It has literally been absolutely horric. The things I have seen they will stay with me for le. On the ward by yourself, it is horrendous. Babies die next to you and the mothers are on their own, it is heartbreaking. Just  weeks into her pregnancy, Abbey was alerted to her pre-eclampsia condition at her anti-natal appointment in March. The rare condition affects up to six per cent of pregnancies with severe cases developing in one to two per cent of mums-to-be. She said: There was six grams of protein in my urine. They said aposI donapost know how you are still walking aboutapos, but I felt absolutely find, that was the scariest part of it. Abbey was admitted to hospital with doctors trying to get the pregnancy to  weeks as the only treatment for the condition is to deliver the baby. She was admitted at  weeks and then discharged, with daily check ups, but a week later she was rushed to Singleton Hospital in Swansea. Her case became severe with concerns she could develop eclampsia, le-threatening fits for mother and baby. The following day, she became dizzy and showed signs of eclampsia so she was rushed to theatre for an emergency Caesarean. Abbey said: I have had two natural births before and I would give birth  times over the c-section. I couldnapost be awake for it as I was dizzy and in and out of consciousness so I woke up not knowingshe had survived. I was so out of it, I didnapost get to see her until  hours after. Baby Forrest was born at  weeks premature so was kept in what Abbey described as a plastic bag to protect her see-through skin, which is designed to replicate the womb. Her partner Keri was present for Forrestaposs birth and showed Abbey photos of their second daughter together when she first came round.Forrest was born on March , two days before the Coronavirus lockdown and restrictions around hospital visits meant both parents were not allowed to enter the anti-natal ward.Keri did not get to see his daughter for the first five weeks of her le which Abbey said put a massive strain on the couple both physically and emotionally. When Keri finally saw his daughter again, the hospital was still operating a one parent on the ward at a time, which mean Abbey had to wait outside when another emergency ensued. Abbey said: She was put on his chest for skin-to-skin, and she pulled her oxygen tube out. So the doctors had to do CPR on her, and that was the first time Keri got to see her and that happened. It was so traumatic. I was outside crying knowing what was going on but not able to go in. She is four months old and he has only held her once because he is so scared. Little Forrest underwent endless procedures in hospital which Abbey had to take in without the support of her partner. In addition, she was pulled over and questioned by police on five occasions while traveling to and from hospital in lockdown. She said: They would ask me where I was from and when I would say Rhondda theyaposd say aposWhat are you doing down hereapos, and I had to explain every time that my baby was in the anti-natal unit. It was fine and they would let me go but it was just an extra stress. In the end the nurses wrote a letter for me to keep in my glove box explaining why I was away from home. Complications continued to arise for Forrest and after she had her nine-week immunisations, she developed a le threatening condition called nectrotising enterocolitis . Abbey said: That night she was pronounced dead in my arms for six seconds and then they revived her. There was about  doctors rushed over. I remember the doctor saying they donapost think she is going to make it through the night. It was the worst night out of the entire experience.Forrest, who weighed just lbs was blue lighted down to University Hospital of Wales in Cardf for emergency bowel surgery and also developed sepsis.Abbey said: The doctors worked so quick, they saved her le, they caught it just in time.

The teenager from Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, who dreams of running her own cleaning business, said: I just love the satisfaction at the end when everything is shiny and all tiny.I prefer to spend my pocket money wisely on new products from BM and Home Bargains that I then post about on my Instagram account. I Iove how cleaning keeps my mental health stable as I clean to take my mind off of things. I love that cleaning can keep me from being bored and it passes the time. Hannah first got into cleaning when she was  years old, helping her mum around the house tidying and cleaning. She used to spend around £ a week on products but now she has a good collection itaposs around £.

Hannah said: Mrs Hinch has massively inspired me and sheaposs been so nice and supportive of my Instagram account. My older sister Katie told me about Mrs Hinch and I think when I began to follow her, my love for cleaning got really strong and I spent my free time cleaning. I have some friends Iaposve made through cleaning and we put a video together for her to help her as she gets a lot of trolls and she saw it and asked to be added to our group chat to thank us all! Mrs Hinch always says how proud she is of us and no matter how tough things get to keep on going because she can see potential in everyone. She tells us just to be ourselves and no one , and she also comments on my photos sometimes too!

To celebrate Saturday’s momentous milestone, we look back at  highlights from her reign and discover some hidden gems courtesy of Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine and royal biographer. . Becoming Queen  Young Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya at Treetops Hotel on February , , when she became Queen on the death of her father, George VI. Ingrid says: “Within two hours of hearing the news they were ready to leave for the airport. “There was a lot of working press waiting there and they stood in attention, with box cameras at their feet, as a mark of respect for the young Queen’s grief.” . The Coronation The crown was offocially placed on the new Queen’s hed on June, ,  in Westminster Abbey, becoming the th Sovereign to be crowned there and the th Queen. A whopping million people in the UK watched it. Ingrid says Prince Philip “kissed her on the cheek and was a little clumsy and slightly shted the crown - apparently she had to slightly adjust it. It was a really intimate touch on the most formal of occasions.” .   World Tour  The Queen set off on a seven month tour of the Commonwealth - her longest ever - in November  and visited  countries in the West Indies, Australasia, Asia, and Africa, covering more than , miles. Charles and Anne stayed at home. Ingrid says: “The children were being looked after by their grandparents and the Queen and Philip used to send diplomatic bags with recordings in them so the children could hear their voices.” . Charles’ investiture The Queen crowned Prince Charles on July ,  at Caernarfon Castle in Wales. One of the stars of the show was the Queen’s hat of yellow silk, with a crown entirely embroidered with pearls and bugle beads. “After some problems with putting his coronet together the designers had to improvise - using a gold-plated ping-pong ball to complete the work” Ingrid says. . Birth of Andrew  Andrew was the first of Elizabeth’s children to be born while she was reigning. He appeared on February ,  at .pm, weighing lb oz.

US visit  Aged , the Queen was greeted at the White House by President Dwight Eisenhower, above - the first serving president she met during her reign. During the tour, the royal party watched an American football game where the Maryland Terrapins defeat the North Carolina Tar Heels -.

Moon landing message  During the Apollo  moon landing in , astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, above, carried — and left behind on its surface — a silicon disk containing messages of peace and goodwill from many world leaders. The Queen’s message to the Moon read: “On behalf of the British people I salute the skill and courage which have brought man to the moon. May this endeavour increase the knowledge and well-being of mankind.” “The Queen has always loved the excitement of space travel. She and Prince Philip are fascinated by it” Ingrid says. . First Tweet  In , while opening the Information Age exhibit at London’s Science Museum, the Queen, referring to herself as Elizabeth R., tapped out her first tweet from the official Twitter account of Buckingham Palace.“The Queen was slow with technology to start with and it was Andrew who used to set the video for her” says Ingrid. “But by  she was Tweeting and now she’s doing Zoom calls…” .  First filmed Christmas message  The Queen’s  Christmas Broadcast was an historic event, as it was the first to be televised. It was also the th anniversary of the first Christmas Broadcast on the radio. The broadcast was made live from the Long Library at Sandringham, Norfolk. Ingrid says: “She was so nervous that it took Philip to go and stand behind the camera where he told a few daft jokes and got her to relax.” .  Charles’ engangement Their engagement became official on February ,  - and the Queen was delighted.

Olympics   After her star turn at the opening ceremony - she took little persuading from Danny Boyle to appear in a short sequence alongside Daniel Craig’s James Bond - the Queen was awarded an honorary BAFTA.

Golden Wedding On November ,  The Queen and Prince Philip celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary, attending a lunch at Banqueting House in London. The Queen made a speech in which she looked back on ‘a remarkable  years’ and paid tribute to the man who was her “strength and stay.” Ingrid says: “It said everything about her relationship with her husband. It was very important to her because that was the year Diana died and the state of the monarchy had been rocky.” . Golden Jubilee  The Queen’s Golden Jubilee in  saw her tour the country, visiting  cities and towns in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in  counties over  days. She also headed overseas - clocking up more than , miles including trips to Jamaica, New Zealand and Australia and drawing huge crowds wherever she went. “The Queen is always very moved when her subjects come out and see her and she really loved it” says Ingrid. “Nowadays she complains that she never sees their faces anymore because they’re all holding up cameraphones.” . First grandchild Princess Anne’s son Peter Phillips was born on November , , at St Mary’s Hospital in London. Royal insiders say Peter is still his grandma’s favourite - and he’s often talked about their close relationship. “She was just about to conduct an investiture when she got the news” says Ingrid. “Very out of character, she held up the investiture for  minutes then apologised for being late due to the birth of her first grandchild!” . Friendship with Reagan  In , celebrations for the th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandyduring the Second World War took place. Insiders say the Queen was extremely moved by the events - as well as a memorable speech from Ronald Reagan who she had become friendly with during his time as President. “Although they were an unlikely friendship she was fond of Reagan and they shared some memorable moments” Ingrid says. “They had a mutual interest in horses.” . Diamond Jubilee The year  marked the th anniversary of accession. The only Diamond Jubilee celebration for any of Elizabeth’s predecessors was in , for Queen Victoria. Her Majesty set two ground rules for the festivities: the use of public funds should be minimised and people should not “be forced to celebrate”. “She worries about making people celebrate her milestones - she’s very humble” Ingrid says. . Harry and Meghan  The Queen liked Meghan when they met in  and the feeling was mutual. Meghan said: “When I met her I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her. And she’s an incredible woman.” Ingrid says: “Despite what followed, the Queen still has affection for the pair, although she is saddened by losing their input into royal le.” . Wills and Kate The Queen was heavily involved with the wedding in  - even down to choosing William’s outfit - an Irish Guards unorm. She later declared the whole day to have been ‘excellent’. “The Queen was overjoyed by Kate and wanted to offer them the most wonderful wedding they could have” says Ingrid. “She basically let them have Buckingham Palace for the night-do.” . Launch of Britannia  The Queen launched her beloved Royal Yacht Britannia from the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank on April , . Britannia conveyed the Queen, other members of the Royal Family and ious dignitaries on  foreign visits and  visits in British waters and steamed ,, nautical miles. “Always very poignant to her because it was going to be made for her father” says Ingrid. “She says it’s the only place she could ever be herself.” . Birth of George The Queen loves all the new additions to the royal family. But George’s arrival in  was a pretty special one - and she’s doted on him since then. Her Majesty leaves presents at the foot of his bed when he visits Buckingham Palace. George calls his -year-old grandmother “Gan Gan.” “When she first went to visit George after his birth she couldn’t believe how noisy he was because he never stopped crying” Ingrid reveals. “But she loves him.” .  World Cup  The Queen opened the World Cup in England during the opening ceremony at Wembley Stadium. And she was back just a few weeks later to present captain Bobby Moore with the Jules Rimet trophy as England beat West Germany -. “It was good fun - she’s not the biggest football fan but she knew what a shot in the arm it was for us win” says Ingrid. . Burmese the horse So loved was Burmese that she was given the unusual honour of being buried on the grounds of Windsor. She was presented to the Queen by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Her Majesty rode her at Trooping the Colour for  consecutive years from  to . “Her love of horses was epitomised in that no-one  was ever allowed to ride her” says Ingrid. “In , when shots were fired at the Queen while she was riding at Trooping the Colour her first thought was for Burmese.” . Ascot winner  The Queen is a huge fan of horse racing and even takes part in the £ sweep in the Royal Box at Ascot. The high point of her career as an owner came at Ascot in  with her horse Estimate, a four-year-old who won the Gold Cup. Estimate’s victory was the first time the Gold Cup had been won by the reigning monarch. “This was probably one of her greatest days ever for someone who is incredibly knowledgeable about racing and breeding” says Ingrid. . th birthday  In  Elizabeth celebrated her th birthday. She lit a beacon which set in train a series of over  beacons across the country and worldwide. As well as her celebrations in April, the country held a giant street party for , people. “She always says ‘If I stop I drop’ and she’s got no intention of stopping” Ingrid says.

After Le star Ricky Gervais, Gavin  Stacey’s Alison Steadman and Strictly’s Craig Revel Horwood are among the famous faces backing a campaign to commemorate the lives of those who have died during lockdown. Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have thrown their weight behind the bid launched by the charity Marie Curie UK and backed by the Sunday Mirror. Comedian Ricky, who plays a grief-stricken husband in After Le, said: “Everyone needs time to grieve and heal. “The pandemic has meant thousands of people haven’t been able to say goodbye to loved ones in the way they would have wanted. Many haven’t got to hold their nearest and dearest. To have a day that officially honours those people – in whatever form – would be a wonderful celebration of their lives.” More than , people died in the UK during lockdown – equating to one million people bereaved. From March to June, , were recorded as “excess deaths”, including more than , coronavirus victims. Grieving families were unable to comfort each other, with mourners limited to between  and  people at crematoriums and ­graveyards. Most funeral homes were unable to offer viewings. Marie Curie, which gives support to ­families living with terminal illness, wants the Government to mark the UK’s loss on the first anniversary of lockdown, March , . Chief executive Matthew Reed said it would be“an ­important reminder of our responsibility to our communities”. They have launched a petition to get people to support the idea with the hashtag #UniteInMemory, with almost , people adding their signatures so far. The charity is keen to look at ideas for an “inclusive” act of remembrance. This could range from a service such as the one observed for Remembrance Sunday, or a communal act such as the Thursday night clapping that rang out for NHS workers during lockdown. The charity’s ambassador Alison Steadman lost a relative to Covid-. Alison, , said: “The funeral was delayed and there could only be a small number of people. I worry there will be a tide of emotion from people bereaved and they will carry that throughout their lives.  “After going through the scariest period of our letime, a special day could be something nice to come out of the pandemic, just like the Thursday night NHS claps and all the kind deeds.” Actor Greg Wise, ­comedian Paul Chuckle and commentator Chris Kamara echo her call. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood suggested Britain could shut for a day to “pause and remember”.  He said: “When this pandemic passes there’s a risk people will forget about it quickly but it should be remembered and those we lost should also be remembered.” Presenter Paul O’Grady said: “Families saw loved ones get into an ambulance and, for many, that was the last time they saw them. There’s been no real closure for people, they’ve just been left dazed. A day like this would help ease the pain.” Loose Women star Coleen Nolan said it was “important we recognise the sense of grief suffered by so many”. She said: “It would give them some comfort to know the rest of Britain stands in solidarity.”  Ex-EastEnder Debbie Arnold and former Corrie star Sherrie Hewson, who present YouTube hit The ­Wonderbirds, also back it. Sherrie’s brother Brett Hutchinson died at the age of  in April from a brain tumour and she could not see him in his final hours. She said: “I’ll always look back at  as the most horrendous year of my le.  “There should be a big street party. The pain is hard but I’d like to remember him on a joyous occasion.” The campaign also had the backing of major political parties. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: “Losing a loved one is always devastating, but losing someone without even being able to say goodbye must be unbearable.  “The Government should back a national day to reflect.” Lib Dem leadership hopeful Layla Moran said people had “experienced devastating losses” and urged the Government to introduce the day. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “We should include all those who have passed and remember close friends and family whose funerals we were not able to attend.” Families are touched by the campaign. Jenny Wilson, , of Belfast, lost her mum Karen, , to throat cancer and her funeral was held on the first ­official day of lockdown. She said: “We’d no time to remember Mum and were left with a gaping hole of grief. I hope a national day will honour everyone who didn’t have the funeral they deserved.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top lawyer says evidence shows","story":"NewsTop lawyer says evidence shows woman jailed for murdering love rival is innocentEXCLUSIVE: Top lawyer Nazir Afzal believes that Harmohinder Mindy Sanghera was not responsible for the  death of pregnant Sana Ali, ShareCommentsByPatrick HillJohn Siddle:,  JUL NewsHarmohinder Mindy Sanghera had been in a two-year relationship with Sana’s husband Sair, unaware he was married \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But now, after a -year career, the lawyer is focused on DEFENCE in a murder case he claims was a miscarriage of justice. And he aims to clear a woman he believes was wrongly convicted. Dentistry student Harmohinder Sanghera – known as Mindy – was jailed for le in  for the killing of -year-old Sana Ali. Mindy, now , had been in a two-year relationship with Sana’s husband Sair, unaware he was married and expecting a child. The trial heard that when she found out she took a kitchen kne from her home in Solihull, Birmingham, and drove  miles to Sana’s house in Bury, Greater Manchester. It was claimed she attacked the teenager in a bedroom and stabbed her  times – with the fatal blow to her abdomen, killing her unborn baby. But Mindy told the court she only visited Sana to tell her what kind of man he was. She claimed Sana was fine when she left. Despite no forensic evidence linking her to the scene, a jury convicted her by - and she got le with a minimum  years. Mr Afzal studied the case shortly before leaving his role in  – and decided something wasn’t right. In his book The ­Prosecutor he wrote: “This was the last case I would explore in detail. This time I wasn’t looking to prosecute, but to seewe had got it wrong.” Three pieces of evidence made him certain:When Sana was found dead in a pool of blood after the visit the front door was locked from the INSIDE, so nobody could have left without being let out. Mindy was seen on CCTV at a petrol station on her way home, looking relaxed and with no signs of being close to someone who had lost so much blood. Mr Azfal debunks the prosecution claim that Mindy climbed on a cupboard and fled through a tiny kitchen window leaving a footprint on the work surface. And that she wore a paper suit, never found, for the attack.Mr Afzal said he would have expected blood to be all over Mindy’s clothes, on the cupboard or the window, adding: “I’ve prosecuted hundreds of murders and never has anyone taken a forensic suit along, it beggars belief.  “They also said she climbed out of the window, but the footprint was facing the other way.” The defence case at the time was that Sana let Mindy out of the house and someone  had murdered her. But Mr Afzal doesn’t believe that either – and claims Sana killed herself. He points to crime scene analysis that showed she was sat on the edge of her bed bleeding from cuts to her arms. A deep cut to her abdomen indicated that she was sitting and bent over – meaning any attacker would have had to kneel in front of her, or it was self-inflicted. Then there was the phone evidence. Between .pm and .pm Sana received  calls and texts from family members. Mr Afzal writes: “Why would there be so many attempts to contact her unless people genuinely thought she might do something to harm herself, or that harm had been brought to her.” He also highlights evidence from Sana’s sister, who called an ambulance saying: “I think I’ve just found out my sister’s… killed herself… I don’t know.” A pathologist’s report stated some injuries “could have been inflicted by the attacker to mimic self-inflicted injuries”. Mr Afzal said: “I’m surprised a pathologist would say this without also suggesting injuries that looked self-inflicted could look that way because they were. Both sides advanced flawed arguments and, to me, it seems very likely the deceased killed herself.” Mindy’s appeal was dismissed and a referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission also failed – yet a family campaign to prove her innocence continues with Mr Afzal’s backing. “The more I think about this case the more I think ‘Oh my God.’ The focus was on the suspect and everyone jumped on the same bus,” he said. “I’ve promised to do all I can to help the campaign.”  Mindy’s parents Paul, , and Suki, , want the case urgently re-investigated. Postie Paul said: “We have never doubted Mindy’s innocence. She will never get her lost years in prison back but she can be vindicated.” Paul believes police decided to nail Mindy as soon as she contacted them to say she had visited Sana to warn her over Sair. She was arrested and questioned  times in four days before being charged. He said: “As soon as Mindy came forward, the police narrative was she must have been the killer. But all the evidence was circumstantial. There was no blood found on her or in her car. They said she crawled through a small window but there wasn’t a scratch on her.  “We think the police didn’t bother to investigate any other possibilities once they had Mindy in custody. “They never looked at suicide, despite evidence pointing that way. To us, it was a dereliction of duty.” Mindy is in HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire, due for parole next year. But her family say she will not stop fighting to prove her innocence. Suki said: “She is humble and respectful and wants justice. It’s been a traumatic experience for  years. “We trusted the justice system but it’s failed us.” Ex-detective Mark Williams-Thomas has probed the case in his podcast The Detective. He too says he has “serious concerns” about the conviction.  “I’ve found compelling evidence Sana killed herself,” he said. “The prosecution case was Mindy climbed through a window with a gap of ft, managing to leave no forensic trace. It’s clear the defence totally failed to identy the issues with the police theory.” Solicitors are now reassessing the case for the family. Paul added: “We are so grateful to Nazir and Mark. We need other experts to offer a hand. “We want people to listen to the podcast and make their own minds up. But we know our daughter isn’t a killer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"town gridlocked motorway blocked hundreds","story":"NewsTown gridlocked and motorway blocked as hundreds gather for huge car meetPolice say there are numerous vehicles using the hard shoulder at speed on the M as hundreds gather for a meet in Denton, which is gridlocked according to residentsShareCommentsByRebecca DayJamie Hawkins:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsHundreds of people have reportedly met up on an industrial estate just off a motorway this afternoon \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The rain comes after Brits flocked to the beach yesterday as temperatures soared with parts of the UK being hotter than Mexico. Beach goers in areas such as Bournemouth, Dorset and Cornwall were able to enjoy scorching temperatures as high as C. But with patchy rain on the way, summer antics will be put on pause. BBC weatherman Tomasz Schafernaker said: It is going to turn wet in the south, so through the early hours of the morning we are expecting some rain in Cardf, Southampton, London and Norwich. Mild here at  degrees, the north of the country over night with the clear skies will turn very chilling, temperatures can be five, six, and seven degrees out of town.Sunday will be a very dferent day across Wales and the north of England ... in fact clear skies and beautul weather for Liverpool, for Hull, for Newcastle.The south of the country will be cooler and cloudier probably some spits and spots of rain still effecting the extreme south east.  Tomasz added: Beyond Sunday we are expecting the high pressure to build off the Atlantic and that means that the weather will start to settle down so that will mean a fine start to the week ahead. Light winds, plenty of sunshine, just a bit of fair weather cloud building up. A really pleasant summeraposs day to come for the start of the week. Temperatures will be around  in London and a little bit fresher in the north at around  celsius. Earlier this week, a swarm of flying ants was spotted on a weather radar and caused interference to the system.

And I can’t see everyone obeying Bojo’s edict to get back to work. That’s a pity, because the workplace isn’t just where you earn your living. It’s where you learn how to do the job, from older and wiser heads. It’s where you make friends with workmates – and sometimes more than friends, for better or for worse. Countless marriages are madebetween the desks. It’s from there you toddle off to the pub for a swt half, or a slow half-dozen, on the way home. You can’t enjoy these professional and social relationships hunched over a laptop on the kitchen table. A new generation is missing that vital contact.

With further easing of lockdown restrictions, people do not have to wear a mask while at the office, working out at the gym or socialising at a pub or restaurant. But face coverings are compulsory when travelling by public transport or visiting shops and supermarkets. Boris Johnson announced a string of measures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus when gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools reopen on July  but wearing face masks is not one of them. Fitness enthusiasts will not have to wear face coverings while working out at the gym when centres reopen after the coronavirus lockdown.UK guidelines for wearing face masks are looser than countries such as Spain where people are required to wear a mask on the beach and at swimming pools, except when eating or swimming. But the new rules seem to be conflict with Government demands to wear masks in enclosed public spaces and make them compulsory in shops from Friday leading to growing confusion. The latest UK government advice says face masks are strongly encouraged in enclosed public spaced when coming into contact with people you do not normally meet. It also states you must wear a face covering at all times on public transport or when attending a hospital as a visitor or outpatient. UKactive, representing Britainaposs gyms and leisure centres, told MailOnline it spent last week in talks with Ministers to set guidance for its , member firms. The industry body said it is ensuring the fitness sector is aligned to Government guidance in the lead up to its reopening. But a spokesperson said UKactive would not expect face coverings to become mandatory in our facilities including , leisure centres, swimming pools and gyms. It says this is according to World Health Organisation guidance that people should not wear masks while exercising indoors as they may be less able to breathe comfortably. A build up of sweat on face mask materials could also encourage the growth of microorganisms, it states. Fitness chains have been preparing to reopen with new safety measures to protect members against coronavirus including limited visitor numbers, regular deep cleaning, and staff temperature checks. Virgin Active members will not have to wear face masks when most of its  UK gyms open on Saturday. David Lloyd also confirmed face masks will not be compulsory in its  UK health clubs. A UKactive spokesperson said: We note the Government’s decision on face coverings on shops and public transport where it is harder to keep social distancing in place. However, we also support the Government’s consideration that there need to be practical requirements for each sector. As such, when it comes to gyms and leisure centres, the appropriate mitigation measures will be in place to make sure that social distancing remains. Therefore we would not expect face coverings to become mandatory in our facilities. Wearing a face mask does not protect you from coronavirus, according to Government advice.

Lisa Brookfield, , left the premises halfway through an appointment in tears after what she described as discrimination. She left Mark Jeffs Hair  Beauty Studios in Lincoln after revealing she had suffered three waves of Covid- before making a recovery in May. Concerns were raised that Lisa, who has suspected asthma, was refusing to wear a mask properly, and the appointment was ended at the hair washing stage.The salon offered to blow dry her hair and re-arrange an appointment, but Lisa stormed out with her hair dripping wet feeling humiliated and went to another salon, LincolnshireLive reports.Lisa, who wanted her hair to look nice for a dinner with a friend on Friday evening and her first date in a year, said: The salon refused to cut my hair because I mentioned I have previously had Covid - three waves of it with the last one being in May. I left the salon with my hair dripping wet and in tears. They askedI wanted it blow dried and said I will just do it myself when I go home. I think what happened to me is a form of discrimination. I had Covid months ago and itaposs not fairI cannot access services. I went to another salon in a village and they said they were all right to cut peopleaposs hairthey had had Covid. Lisa, a forensic psychologist from With St Hughs, said she had originally booked her appointment for .am but the salon contacted her to say her usual stylist was not available. A new appointment was arranged for .am the same day. Lisa admits that she was  minutes late because she mistakenly thought the cut was scheduled for .am. The salon was able to accommodate her later on. Lisa said: I went in to reception and askedthey wanted me to wear a mask and I was offered a mask.  When I went through I mentioned to the hair stylist who was going to cut my hair that I likely have asthma and a mask restricts my breathing. I askedit was all rightI pulled it down slightly and the stylist said that was ok. I said I had actually had Covid three times, meaning I had had three waves of it. As another person was washing my hair, a stylist came through and said Mark Jeffs had made a decision that because I had had Covid, the appointment could not continue. I had just been saying how good their protective procedures and equipment were. I got up with wet hair wrapped up in a towel and went to reception. Mark told me: aposYou wonapost wear a mask.apos. I said that was not accurate and that I would wear a mask but it restricts my breathing. Then he said I was  minutes late and I apologised and said it was human error. He said I was being threatening but I was not. The salon, in St Paulaposs Lane, issued the following statement:The safety of all our customers and staff is our first priority as we operate under the Covid- restrictions. The salon has a very strict risk assessment that applies to all our customers and staff. We have spent over £, on making the salon COVID- secure and our customers acknowledge that this is a safe environment. On this occasion, the customer was late for their original appointment and could not be seen then due to implemented time slots to adhere to social distancing and to provide the ability to clean each area between clients. Arriving on time is clearly stated under the client guidance on our website and clearly displayed at the salon entrance. However, we made arrangements to accommodate the client later in the day. Unfortunately, despite informing a staff member at the beginning of their treatment that they had suffered three Covid-related health episodes, they refused to wear a mask properly.

People wanted to give me a head start because I was small, then they would see me run and say, #No, it#s OK#.#When she was , her family moved to Dunfermline and the next few years passed in a dramatic flurry of success, superlatives and spiralling media interest.During the summer, she pushed her body through the wringer on the track in a iety of events, recording noteworthy times in the lot of them.Then in the winter, at just , she won the Scottish cross-country championship asit was a stroll in the park and even the toughest coaches began to recognise she was something special.Friends and colleagues remember her being superbly disciplined, training six days a week, and blessed with the attitude that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains.Her late father, John, was a tremendous influence on her career # and he inspired generations of other stars, both at Pitreavie and in the wider athletic community.Macdonald’s progress, as she aspired to a place in Team GB for the  Olympics was exemplary.And although there were plenty of reasons to be cynical about those Games # which were blighted by an American boycott and tarnished by drug scandals and suspicions that many hormone monsters went unpunished # Macdonald#s story provided one of the genuinely uplting moments to savour.What made her accomplishments all the more extraordinary was the fact that she didn#t even run her first m race until she was .And yet, within the next  months, she was representing her country on the global stage, becoming the youngest Briton ever to reach an Olympics sprint final, and the youngest to win a medal # the bronze in the m relay.When you look back at the pictures of her in Moscow in , you can discern she was the baby of the team, just ft in tall and weighing a mere seven stone.But she spoke about the three performances which defined her career # the race in which she qualied for the Olympics at Crystal Palace the day when she broke the senior British m record and then the semi-final in the Olympics and, of course, the final of the xm relay where she drove a truck through the record books.She and her teammates, Michelle Scutt, Joslyn Hoyte-Smith and the late Donna Hartley came behind Russia and East Germany in the final, but nothing could detract from the quartet’s unfettered joy when they collected their medals.Macdonald said later: #You are not just scared that you will let yourself down, you are scared that you will let the team down as well.#I ran the first leg because that was totally in lane # I was so small and it was so aggressive, it would have been easy for me to be knocked off the track.#It can be quite lethal at the changeover. But it was just the most amazing feeling # the crowds, the noise, the whole atmosphere inside the stadium.#Macdonald was pitted against many legendary runners from Eastern Europe, several of whom were widely believed to be using steroids.The truth about the scale of the abuse gradually emerged in the years ahead # and it wasn’t simply confined to the likes of Russia and East Germany, but cast a cloud over the whole of the Olympics on the track, in the pool and the heavyweights arena and involved competitors in almost every nation, including Britain.As a teenager, MacDonald was unaware of the enormity of the problem, but as somebody who later studied medicine at Edinburgh University, it soon dawned on her how many records, medals and kudos were being gained through cheating.However, she recalled of her performances in Moscow: “People joked about the drugs and I joined in, but I didn#t realise what they meant.“We joked about the women looking like men, and them having muscles in places that we didn#t even have places.“But I certainly didn#t run with a sense of injustice, because I was just trying to do as well as I could.#She succeeded in that objective. With a vengeance. In the bigger picture, Allan Wells, Steve Ovett, Sebastian Coe and Daley Thompson might have commanded banner headlines with their gold medals, but there were ample tributes and paeans of praise to the youngster in their midst who was awarded the nickname the Fe Flyer.She had imagined it would be just be her parents and a few friends in the Kingdom who were watching her heroics at the Olympics, but the size of the audiences swelled as people across the planet sat up and took notice of her feats.There were people who believed that Macdonald was destined for future greatness in the heady afterglow of her giddy rise to prominence.They seemed to think that, because she was reaching major finals at such a young age, it was inevitable she would continue improving en route to the top of the podium.But, as Macdonald developed and moved into her s, the injuries and stresses increased and it became more dficult for her to rally from these setbacks. One week, it was tendonitis, the next it was a muscle spasm. And it had a cumulative effect.In , when the Scot picked up European junior m bronze in Utrecht, she was in the same company as future world record breakers including Heike Drechsler and Sabine Rieger, both of whom were subsequently implicated in doping scandals.Yet, while they kept improving their times and climbed up the rankings # although many of their milestones have now been deleted from the record books # Macdonald was stuck in neutral and eventually heading into reverse gear.She said later: “Many of these athletes from Eastern Bloc countries were part of a system who did not even know what they were given.“Many thought they were receiving vitamin supplements. There were so many other aspects at play. I just really loved my time competing. They were still really innocent Games in other respects. Or at least, that is how it felt to me.“I was just so delighted to be doing something I loved. When you#re actually involved in something, you just feel that it is natural and normal.#At , Macdonald went with the Scottish team to Brisbane for the  Commonwealth Games and once again secured a bronze in the xm relay.But there were disappointments after that. She was eliminated in the heats of the European Championships in Athens that same year. And she was not in the frame at all for the  Olympics in Los Angeles.mdash PictureThis ScotlandApril , Ultimately, she never bettered the time of . she had achieved at . But there were still a string of other plaudits to collect on the domestic circuit which she dominated.Macdonald has no regrets about her success being relatively ephemeral. She relished her time in the spotlight, but she was bright as a button, fascinated by the world of science, engineering and medicine and was determined to pursue an academic path.Nowadays, she still enjoys putting on her trainers and pounding the streets of Hong Kong when she is allowed a break from looking after her patients. But she is happy in her work, her family le, and strikes one as a truly contented soul.She said recently: “I still run most days and still love doing it. Sport is a way of le for me. But I hate even to call it running. I really just jog along, most days # not far: three or four miles, something like that. I do a lot of hiking with a jog in it.“People tend to think, as I did at first, that Hong Kong is an urban jungle, full of buildings, but the majority is trails and trees.#I can walk and run for hours and not see another person.#Fraser Clyne represented Scotland on the international athletics stage for many years and now writes about track and field for the Press  Journal.And he has nothing but admiration for the exploits of Linsey Macdonald in the s.He said: #I was on the same Scotland team as Linsey on a few occasions, most notably at the  Commonwealth Games.#However, what amazed me about her was her range of abilities. We both represented Scotland at the  world cross country championships in Madrid.#She must be the only Olympic sprint medallist to have also competed in a world cross country championships # and she did it just a year later.#She was such a quiet and unassuming young athlete, but I thought that she produced an amazing performance in Moscow.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Edinburgh’s historic Royal Mile.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-efforts-cockenzie-port-seton-dunbar-gullane-haddington-musselburgh-north-berwick-prestonpans","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

newly built hangar, breached their Climate Change Strategy and threw out the plans at a meeting in February.Protestors told councillors that alternative sites for the new centre, which would avoid destroying the tree belt, had not been given proper consideration.They pointed to an area to the west of the original site, and proposed new land on the neighbouring Gilmerton Estate as a better location.Now Historic Environment Scotland , which has responsibility for the airfield which the original museum is built on as a scheduled monument, \"likely consider objecting to the centre being placed on the western site.In a statement lodged with the appeal, HES said it had been in discussions with museum bosses for nearly  years over the new visitor centre.Despite making no comment on the plans when they came before East Lothian Council in February for a decision, HES said it supported the visitor centre proposals.And it said in : ldquoOne alternative option on the west side of the scheduled monument was noted as being potentially problematic.\"If presented with a similar options appraisal today, we would likely provide similar advice, that being that the construction of a large visitor facility near the end of one of the runways would likely impact on key views along that runway.ldquoWe would consider views along and from the runway of an airfield to be a key characteristic of the cultural signicance of the site, and proposals that impacted on these views would likely result in a negative impact.HES said that view had not changed and remained advice it would give applicants, and it said of the impact of  trees being destroyed and the centre built to the south of the scheduled monument: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible, but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.East Lothian Council submitted a response to the appeal which said it would be willing to consider a new site to the west of the airfield.It said: ldquo East Lothian Council is not opposed to the proposal of a new hangar however, East Lothian Council is opposed to the proposed location.ldquoIf the applicant was able to provide an alternative location for the hangar which did not involve the felling of such a substantial number

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

And oddly, it wasnt planned to be a lockdown show and although we obviously filmed it in lockdown, my husband, who is a film-maker, he filmed it, so we didnt actually have to do other things dferently... and yeah I think, you know, it was something that lots of people were thinking about.\"Lots of people suddenly with a bit more time had this kind of urge to be a little bit creative and make things for their homes or their gardens, so it does feel quite timely, like it has tapped into a bit of a zeitgeist and a bit of a... response to a dficult situation, allowing people to get creative and have fun doing it.\"Who  appears in the show with you \"Its three of us - Max and Zoe - who are, it has to be said, a lot more talented and creative than me. Ive been a long admirer of people like Max and Zoe who seem to be able to create things out of nothing with seemingly no effort at all.\"For me, I can have lots of ideas but I do find doing them quite dficult so it was a big learning curve for me to actually, instead of sit and think, Oh, I could maybe do this with that one day, actually having to get on and do it.\"And you know, learn about dferent drill bits and how you screw a screw in straight and kind of problem solve. So I probably had to do a lot more problem-solving than Max and Zoe, who as I say are just sort of brilliant at it. What I hope is that people watching the show who maybe are a bit more like me and have always felt a little bit daunted at the prospect of upcycling something, might have a go, because they might look at me and think, Ah well,she can do it, we definitely can.\"What can you tell us about the clay pizza oven you build as one of the projects on the show \"We had the idea because, before this project was even talked about, we were building a new pondand so we dug it out with a digger and weve got really heavy clay soil and I was like, Weve got all this clay, it just seems like a waste not to do something with it.\"And then this project came up and I said to the production company, weve got all this clay, we could use it to make an oven. It was just a really nice way of using, the perfect thing of weve got this stuff lying round, were not quite sure what to do with it, lets try and make something beautul and useful.\"Its a long project and its quite complicated but it was lovely that at the beginning of the filming process it was the very first thing we started to do because we knew it would take quite a long time to build... but on pretty much our last day filming we were eating pizzas, which was great.\"There was also an emotional side behind a few of the stories, did you find that at all with anything you upcycled \"I know there were some things that Zoe did that, they were old pieces of furniture or old things that were very connected to her family. I didnt have any of that but for me, creating something as lasting as a pizza oven, thats something thats going to be, its now very much part of our lives and something that we use and that we built here and there is something very satisfying about that.\"One of the other things we did was we made a herbal bath. And the herbal bath was an old bath we found in our local reclamation yard and planted as a herb garden and it looks beautul and its just outside our back door. So I go and pick herbs from it every time Im cooking, so thats really nice.\"It feels like weve created things that have a genuine use day to day and just, you know, become part of our lives. Its always really lovely to receive a present from somebody that feels very personal and I think doing projects like the ones weve done all feel very personal, they feel like theyve come from a very personal space rather than somebody saying, Oh, why dont you make this .\"Can you tell us anything about your upcoming book \"It comes out on September  and its called A Year Of Living Simply. Sort of bizarrely it is about a lot of the things that I think people have started to connect to in these last few months.\"Its about the pleasures to be had of a le that is simpler, that doesnt involve going out and buying things, its more about the pleasure you get from growing things, from making things, from mending things, from just, you know, simply activities or pleasures like cooking your favourite thing or going and foraging for stuff or having time in nature and going for walks.

It should be on your wish-list because the whole area of Crinan and Knapdale is fascinating ndash geologically unusual and littered with ancient artefacts, standing stones, forts and duns. Castle Dounie, the focus of this walk, is an Iron Age fort that straddles a high ridge with sumptuous sea views across to Jura and Scarba, two islands separated by the notorious Corryvreckan and its whirlpool.Crinan Harbour lies just west of the tiny village of Crinan where the eponymous canal empties out into Loch Crinan. There is a sizeable car park here, just beyond the first few houses as the road turns right into Crinan Harbour. From the car parkalong the road, past the junction to a white cottage. In front of it a signposted waymarker points out the route, along a shingly foreshore for a short distance.Another sign indicates where the path leaves the shore and runs parallel to it for a while through a lovely grove of oak trees. Shortly after a wooden bench the path veers slightly left and begins to climb what appears to be a firebreak through the woods. There is another bench halfway up the hill which may offer a bit of relief.Enjoy your break, and the views that are now opening up, because you wonrsquot see many more views for a while, and therersquos more climbing to be done. At the top of the steep path turn right onto a forestry track and enjoy easier walking to another junction and bench. Turn left here and climb a little more gently now to another, narrower, path that runs off to the right.I got quite excited at this point for at last we were away from broad forestry tracks and among native trees with views beginning to open out across Loch Crinan towards the sea. A narrow pass took us to another rest stop. Not a wooden bench this time but a full-blown picnic table. It seemed a little churlish not to use it.After lunch we carried on over a rise, along a slight descent before reaching another junction. Our descent route went to the right but before that we wanted to climb to the castle viewpoint and were delighted to actually reach the viewpoint by climbing through the ancient dunrsquos entrance.There are enough fortications still in existence at Castle Dounie to give you a pretty good idea of what it must have been like. It was a great spot to linger awhile in the sunshine. I took my boots off, lay back against one of the retaining walls and simply gazed across the vast area of sea towards the island of Scarba. Away to the north the peaks of Cruachan stood proud, but the best of the view was to the north-west towards the high hills of Mull. What a spot.It took a lot of effort to put my boots back on and begin the descent, back to the last path junction where we simply walked on straight ahead, steeply downhill to another junction with a forest track. We turned right onto the track and what do you know  It began climbing again, a long haul up to another viewpoint and wooden bench. I was beginning to grow quite fond of these benches.Back on the path we still hadnrsquot finished climbing . We ed to one of the benches we passed earlier and then we were homeward bound. Back to the top of the steep climb, down the grassy slopes of the steep climb to the bench by the shore and then the woodland path back to Crinan Harbour.

This is all discussed amongst us diners back in the house as huge puffy balls called La Bomba de la Barcoloneta heat gently, alongside gambas al ajilloand patatas bravas, as we peer over a tub crowned with fluffy spinach and wonderit is espinacas con garbanzos. And is it meant to be heated  Then rush to pull something labelled escalavida out the oven and put the espinacas and a separate dish of British asparagus rolled in -month serrano in instead ndash the escalavida is to be served cold. Phew.A pause here for a word from my sponsors: We donrsquot take freebies in The Herald restaurant columns, I always pay. I donrsquot know chefs. And the Hootsmon and The Herald remain the same professional combatants they have been since the days when I was chief reporter of that venerable Edinburgh newspaper  years ago, and long, long before that. But these are not normal times.When an email was forwarded from The Herald with a request to call someone called Campbell Mickel and then that phone call took place, I thought it a bit strange asI have ever met Mr Mickel I wasnrsquot aware of it. Turns out hersquos a chef. From Merienda.Uh-oh. Chefs usually only ever call to complain. But hang on, I liked Merienda. Herersquos what he said in the call anyway. Since that review lots of people from Glasgow have made the trip through to Edinburgh to eat at the restaurant, he was surprised at thatand as he was delivering food to some people in the west on a non-commercial basis ndash would I accept some Ummm. For two reasons I said yes.  hands up: I hadnrsquot ordered anything to review this week and  Irsquom telling you upfront, right now that I havenrsquot paid for this.The food writer from The Scotsman  Lives in Glasgow and was passing by the restaurant and my side of the cityand would very kindly deliver. No, we donrsquot know each other. Bit like the trenches at Christmas then I did learn something very interesting from the phone call.

A cuisine Irsquom claiming expertise in having eaten at superstar restaurants El Celler De Can Roca and Compartir kinda recently.Those bomba, then: crispy shell, doused in aioli, crunching and cracking when broken open to reveal mashed potato and inside that minced beef, all dipped into a sprightly tomato sauce. Clean, fresh, and appetising.A container has been upended to reveal Catalan vegetables: sweet and slow-roasted peppers on freshly-made goats curd, pretty much the whole tangy thing held together with a translucent jelly.Powerfullygarlicky shrimp follows a patatas bravas made by someone who cares to choose the right potatoes and all mopped up with a magnicent and recently baked loaf that somehow manages to be both moist and almost shortcrust flaky outside.

Portugal has been one of the most successful countries in Europe at controlling the virus, partly because of its cautious approach in imposing lockdown much sooner in the diseases trajectory than neighbouring Spain . Another reason has been its record on testing ndash it has consistently tested a much higher proportion of its population than most other European countries, having decided early on that Portugal would produce its own tests, rather than relying on imports, and state and private laboratories collaborated with the government from the start. This could give an appearance of higher incidence of the virus than in some countries where there has been less testing. Moreover, the opposition parties supported the government, avoiding making the crisis a political football as has happened where. And the tourism sector has gone to great s to make everywhere that tourists might go as safe as possible. No Bournemouth beach scenes there.I have started to wonder whether Westminster has made this decision for political reasons. Portugal has a successful socialist government which managed to reverse austerity measures while still reducing its debt, and which was re-elected in September. I realise this may feel like a conspiracy theory, but would it be so surprisingBoris Johnsons government wanted to damage the economy of a socialist country  And given the extent to which Portuguese tourism depends on UK tourists, it certainly would cause damage.Portugal is a beautul country with wonderful people, and deserves to be treated better. . Moreover, Portugal is a friend of Scotland, Portuguese people seem very aware of the position that Scotland is currently in when I went back to visit last September, friends and strangers alike would say things like \"We know you in Scotland didnt vote to leave the EU, were really sorry this is happening\". Therefore,Scotland could show friendship to Portugal by unilaterally lting the UK ban, I am sure it would be appreciated enormously,Cathy Benson, Edinburgh.LET THE PEOPLE VOTE FOR HONOURSIT was while watching old footage about the ennoblement of Lynton Crosby for his services to the Tory Party that I got round to thinking about our countrys honours system.Over and above, my view was reinforced by the recent newspaper stories about Damehoods being bought for as much as pound,.If honours are to have genuine relevance today, they should be focused on those who have benefited the wellbeing and prosperity of the community in general.Both the examples above do not meet the criteria laid out in my previous sentence.Crosby was awarded his knighthood for his position as a paid partisan propagandist for a particular political party while the money offered to purchase a Damehood was for the selfish purpose of enhancing the purchasers social standing.Those two examples make a mockery of the intent behind such honours.Eligibility for such awards should not be confined to the decisions of a secretive small committee but should be thrown open to the public at large to nominate suitable people from the following categories ndash entertainers, sportspersons, politicians, public servants, charity workers and entrepreneurs.Such a procedure would give the public the pleasure and privilege of proposing those they consider worthy of such awards and would eliminate the sleaze which operates behind closed doors under the camouflage of a so-called impartial committee.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.PSYCHIATRY HAS SERIOUS FORM FOR LIESMUCH more concerning, I suggest, than lies which are gullibly believed by society are the truths which it dismisses without any consideration . Few would dispute Ron McKays suggestion that the current US President is a serial misspeaker but is Donald Trump pathologically unstable, as many other commentators insist he is  Here, we find ourselves in the realm of mental illness and, whenever I want my own biases to be confirmed, I always turn to the visionary psychiatrist Thomas Szasz . In his book The Myth Of Mental Illness, Szasz rounded on two mental illnesses which could scarcely be more topical: Drapetomania, and Hysteria.Drapetomania was a psychiatric diagnosis given to enslaved Africans who wished to flee their captivity. The condition was said to be brought on by masters who treated their toiling property too well, giving them a taste for better living conditions.Similarly, Hysteria was a diagnosis frequently ascribed to women who, for whatever reason, refused to bend to a mans will . Quite simply, it was an early form of gaslighting.According to Szasz, what both conditions had in common was not the fact that they were mental illnesses: it was the fact that both labels supplied a pretext to correct behaviour which was socially disapproved of at the time. This was the case with mental illnesses overwhelmingly, which he saw as being largely metaphorical in nature.Psychiatry has serious form where lies are concerned and yet critics of Mr Trump are happy to deploy it against him as a weapon. Szasz has warned us that doing so is a big mistake because, like the cons Ron listed in his amusing article, the pseudoscience of psychiatry is just another one of them.We could learn somethingwe stopped to entertain ideas such as those of Szasz. We could even solve some seriously chronic problems in our society.But, why would we Archie Beaton, Inverness.BBCrsquoS FAT CAT FACTORYSOME years ago my modest bank balance was marginally improved when I joined those of advanced years and was no longer required to pay a television licence. Now this amnesty is over and I find myself again being required to help fund what I think is a fat cat factory where few employees,any, receive less than pound, per year, but from whose premises emerge monotonous miaows of financial misery and hardship.A look down the excessively y list of the higher-profile BBC employees quickly suggests thatthis excessively financed organisation experiences any financial glitches, this has to be because of the pay level at its places of work. Even that other cosseted closet of employment, the House of Lords, cannot be, I am convinced, doling out such beneficence as the BBC. It could be that commercial TV is equally indulgent, but we are not commanded to fork out our pension pennies for its offerings, and thats the dference.It is time the fat cats were told to do some commercial feline hunting for their food.Ian Johnstone, Peterhead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11593570.jpg?type=article-full","title":"airbnbs-scotland-seven-weird-wonderful-staycation-ideas","story":"Our tourism industry officially opened its door again on Wednesday, with the First Minister encouraging people desperate for a holidayto explore more of Scotland rather than taking trips abroad.With that in mind, we thought wed gather together some of AirBnBs most bizarre and beautul listings in Scotland, to help inspire you ahead of your trip.From living in a futuristic airship, to taking up home in a hobbit-hole or even a leboat -

It has plans to renovate properties and boost the population to around  people.Visitor numbers rose from around , in  to more than , last year, which had sparked hopes of a bumper season this year.The closure of the ferry to visitors, means the island is now effectively shut to only the most determined of tourists.The islandersrsquo notice states: ldquoWe are a small and geographically isolated community and as such we are sure you can appreciate and understand that there is a certain level of nervousness about reopening to visitors.It adds that a risk assessment into the feasibility of carrying visitors on the ferry while maintaining the two-metre physical distancing rule meant it could not operate safely.It continues: ldquoObviously, those who are able to cross over to Ulva by their own means may do so, but please be aware of the limited services available on the island.As well as the closure of the Cragaig Bothy on the islandrsquos southside, the islandrsquos public toilets at the Ulva Ferry pontoon will also be shut.The island, which is just three miles wide and around six miles long has been free of Covid-, however Mull, the first Scottish island to declare a shut down on March , has experienced several cases among its , residents.Wendy Reid, Ulvarsquos development manager who arrived on the island in September, said: ldquoWe would prefer to be able to welcome people to the island, but we just canrsquot.ldquoThere is an element of concern about opening to visitors, although generally when people come here they come to walk, so itrsquos not much of an issue.

The whereabouts of Amira Abase, meanwhile, remains unknown.Only Shamima Begum, born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and now , continues to make the headlines, as she did again last week after the UK Court of Appeal ruled that she should be allowed toto Britain to fight the previous decision by the Home Office to revoke her citizenship.To say it was a controversial decision would be an understatement. But then Begumrsquos case is one that has polarised both public and political opinion, and doubtless will continue to do so.For its part the Home Office said the courtrsquos decision was ldquovery disappointing and that it would ldquoapply for permission to appeal.But putting Begumrsquos inidual case aside for a moment, the thorny issue of what should be done about the thousands of other foreign jihadi terrorists, their wives and children still languishing in Kurdish-controlled detention camps in northern Syria, remains a cause for international concern.Likewise the threat posed by those IS cadres still at large has not gone away, with experts warning that many groups are regalvanising while the world is distracted by the coronavirus pandemic.According to research conducted by the Defence Studies Department at Kingrsquos College London in collaboration with the International Institute for Strategic Studies , it is estimated that some , foreign fighters joined ISrsquos self-proclaimed caliphate over the past six years, including almost , European citizens.Far from ing to their countries of origin after the fall of the last IS-held territory in , the vast majority have remained in the region or relocated to areas of growing IS influence around the world.Researchers warn that the mobilisation of foreign fighters has not stopped, with the most recent estimates from  suggesting up to , foreign fighters out of between , and , are still present in the region.Currently there also many women and children previously associated with the IS caliphate ndash like Shamima Begum ndash being held in northern Syria in camps controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces , a mostly Kurdish militia that ldquodefeated the jihadist group with the backing of the US, UK, and other members of the international coalition.It was in one of these, Camp Roj, that Begum, who lived under IS rule for more than three years, was found in February last year. Subsequently moved to another facility known as al-Hol camp while nine months pregnant, Begumrsquos baby later died of pneumonia, the third of three children she has spoken of losing.The al-Hol camp is the regionrsquos largest, with some , people living there cheek by jowl. Those women and children inside the al-Hol camp annex are among nearly , foreigners from more than  countries being held in northeastern Syria due to suspected IS links. Some , Iraqis also live in a separate, larger section of the camp.According to The Washington Post, which cited aid workers and other officials in touch with the women held in the al-Hol annex, it was on June  last month that the authorities said it had begun registering the foreign inhabitants of what it called ldquothe most dangerous camp in the world, almost a year-and-a-half after they first arrived. The registration attempt last month was said to be part of an effort to streamline the camprsquos administration, by creating a comprehensive list of who is actually held there. But it came at a time when concerns are growing over the dozens of women who have reportedly vanished from the camp.According to Anne Speckhard, director of the International Centre for the Study of Violent Extremism , a steady stream of escapes by women has taken place from camps like al-Hol since the autumn of  when President Donald Trump pulled back US special operations forces in the region.Smugglers, according to a number of sources, are reportedly often charging tens of thousand of dollars to help these women escape and flee.Writing recently on the US Homeland Security Today website, Speckhard cites the case of one Swedish and three Finnish women with links to IS who paid smugglers to facilitate their escape out of the al-Hol camp. In this instance these were women, says Speckhard, who were so desperate to come home with their children that they put their lives into the hands of smugglers.According to research by ICSVE, the going price for smuggling out of al-Hol runs from , to ,, with the higher price ensuring a safer journey.Monitoring of social media by ICSVE where IS women discuss the costs of being smuggled out of the camp found far lower prices for bribes to local guards and payments to smugglers. These amounts range from , to , per person six months ago with todayrsquos rates being closer to ,. Much of the money generated for such payments is reported to be raised through shadowy online campaigns and contributors.The Swedish and Finnish cases, Speckhard says, are those that are known about and represent some women who have grown weary, afraid and disillusioned with IS. However, others who have escaped do not necessarily fit this profile and with their whereabouts unknown remain an obvious cause for concern among the security services of ious countries.ldquoOne worrisome case is that of Hayat Boumedienne, whose partner Amedy Coulibaly was one of the perpetrators of the horric January  attacks in Paris, France, Speckhard says, adding that Boumedienne is one of  French female jihadists who have escaped from al-Hol and Ain Issa camps and remain on the loose.Speckhardrsquos unease over those who have vanished is shared by Jean-Charles Brisard, co-founder of the Paris-based Terrorism Analysis Centre.According to Brisard, the number of French IS female escapees from camps in northeast Syria amounts to % of the French women detained in Syria, a not insignicant tally.Just as concern grows over those women linked to IS currently held in detention or on the loose, so too are analysts closely watching the situation regarding male fighters in detention. Among the thousands of IS foreign combatants currently locked up in prison are many high-ranking IS leaders.Just two months ago a quarterly US government report warned that there remains the ldquohigh-impact risk of a mass breakout of IS prisoners from detention camps in Syria.The quarterly Inspector General report, covering January through to March of this year, provides the US congress with an update on the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, using information from the Defence Department, State Department, and US Agency for International Development .Barely a year after the final territory controlled by IS was retaken, the report says that IS prisoners pose ldquoone of the most signicant risks to the success of themission.Around the time of the Hassakeh riot, US General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of US Central Commandcalled the Kurdish-led coalitionrsquos efforts to train and equip prison guards and construct prison structures ldquoa tactical-level Band-Aid, not a long-term solution.ldquoMilitary solutions do not exist for the issues of deradicalisation and repatriation of , McKenzie told the US Congress. ldquoThey are international problems requiring international solutions.Many agree, highlighting the fact there also remains very acute external threats to the integrity of the camps. They point out that any assault by Syrian regime forces, Turkish-backed rebels, or IS sleeper cells on the Kurdish-led coalition positions could see camp guards redeployed to battlefronts, leaving the camps unguarded.This, too, before the onset of coronavirus, which has raised the dangers and stakes even further. Reports at the time of the March riots at Hassakeh prison by the Kurdish Rojava Information Centresuggest it was sparked by inmatesrsquo fear of contracting Covid-.Meanwhile, outside of the camps and prions holding IS combatants, the jihadist grouprsquos propaganda newsletter al-Naba has celebrated that its enemies are growing fearful of the pandemic. Bulletins are often to be found urging attacks on its adversaries amid the crisis, and calls for inmates to be freed from prisons and camps.As the international community focuses its attention on combating the virus, there are signs IS are keen to take further advantage while such a distraction prevails.According to the recent joint Kingrsquos College London and International Institute for Strategic Studiesresearch, the vast majority of fighters still at large after the fall of the last IS-held territory in  have remained in the region or relocated to areas of growing IS influence around the world.ldquoDespite governmentrsquos concerns, numbers of IS foreign fighters ing home and engaging with violent extremism remains relatively low, says Dr Francesco Milan, lecturer in the Department of Defence Studies at Kingrsquos College London. ldquoOf far greater risk is the growing threat from IS in both its former stronghold in Iraq and Syria, and in terrorist zones around the world.As one of the contributors to the International Institute for Strategic Studiesrsquo Armed Conflict Survey , Milan warns that inaction from Western governments in dealing with IS detainees in Syria and Iraq, and a worsening humanitarian situation, provides a perfect breeding ground for a revival of the terrorist caliphate and ldquoposes a far greater long-term strategic risk to countries in the West.Many analysts concur, stressing that while IS might no longer exist as a ldquostate, it remains a formidable terrorist organisation. From Syria and Iraq its members have been decanting to other vulnerable and unstable places like Libya and Afghanistan, in some cases creating a presence that has shted the internal dynamics of conflicts in such places.These ldquorelocators enable IS to evade direct confrontation and to strengthen their operations across the world. In other words, ISrsquos threat to the West remains very real and has done so ever since its ldquolast stand at the Syrian town of Baghouz in March  and the death of its former leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the group continues to thrive in ious parts of the world, here in Europe there was a reminder of the threat it still poses after German police arrested five IS suspects in April said to be planning attacks on US bases. Some reports suggest the suspects had not only pledged allegiance to IS but were in touch with senior operatives.Last week, with the UK Court of Appeal ruling allowing Shamima Begum toto Britain and fight the decision to revoke her citizenship, IS found itself back in the headlines.It has been five years since Begum and her two teenage friends, popular straight-A students at the Bethnal Green Academy in east London, began their journey to join IS.In the intervening years much has happened and in a world preoccupied with fighting Covid-, itrsquos all too easy to forget that other threats of a dferent kind lurk around the globe. IS and its terrorist cadre is one of them and few doubt we have heard the last from them."},{"url":null,"title":"poll-boost-scottish-independent-retailers","story":"According to a poll for Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, the vast majority of Scots will look to shop locally when their local town centres fully reopen following lockdown.The poll, given exclusively to The Herald on Sunday, found that % say they are going to prioritise shopping locally while % say the future of their town centre depends on whether or not local people support them.:Face masks: Where to buy face coverings from independent stores in ScotlandIt also found that % think it is vital that the general public support their local high street. The results come as high streets are facing a battle to survive amid declining footfall and store closures.Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics saw Scottish shop numbers fall from , in  to , in  with vacancy rates sitting at .% for the first quarter of  ndash before lockdown.Local retailers were not only competing with out-of-town shopping malls and discount supermarkets, but there was also the combined effect of many high street banks giving up their sites as more services moved online.However, as retailers emerge from lockdown, the poll will give the sector a boost and comes on the eve of a national campaign to revive town centres post-Covid.The campaign is designed to urge Scots to think local first when it comes to shopping and hospitality, while ensuring they continue to adhere to the Scottish Governmentrsquos public health guidance.It will be run by Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, a national organisation for town centres, in partnership with the Scottish Government.Writing about the poll in The Herald on Sunday today, Leigh Sparks, professor of retail studies and a deputy principal at the University of Stirling, said: ldquoThe polling figures reported here today show the strong support in Scotland for local high streets and towns and the businesses trading there.There is a sense of place and desire to see local stores, businesses and towns succeed, and a recognition that this depends in part on local residents supporting local places.ldquoThe poll suggests that almost two-thirds of respondents will positively sht their spending to this end in the future. We need to ensure we capitalise on this positive sentiment by making it simpler to get to towns and high streets, make them more attractive and interesting, and make them easier places in which to set up local and community businesses and enterprises.Phil Prentice, chief officer of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, pictured below, said: ldquoThese are hugely encouraging findings after a challenging time for town centres, high streets and the local businesses that occupy them. Sometimes we forget that our high streets arenrsquot just a collection of pavements, buildings and streets, they are the very fabric of our communities. The impact of coronavirus on our high streets isnrsquot just financial, itrsquos human.:The  best independent shops in Scotland for Christmas gtsHe said one of the positives of this experience has been how communities have come together and shown compassion and solidarity with one another. Prentice added: ldquoBuilding on this sense of loyalty and community is what is needed to bring about a town centre rival and, while these polling results are encouraging, we need to turn this goodwill and intention into action that is sustainable in the long term.ldquoFor a few months now, we have been working with the Scottish Government and others to develop a campaign, launching tomorrow, which we hope will appeal to this sense of shared identity. But it is still vital that we remind people the virus is still out there and we still need to be careful and adhere to the public health advice.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortiumrsquos head of policy, said: ldquoRetailers will be hoping shoppers help support local shops because the alternative may be those shops disappearing forever. The reality is retail was under immense pressure before this crisis and the combination of lockdown and economic uncertainty means shops are currently trading signicantly lower than a year ago.ldquoWhen combined with the necessary, but onerous, public health and physical distancing measures, many businesses are struggling to make ends meet.ldquoBy getting out to the high street shoppers can help support their favourite brands, but also help those other proximate businesses who rely on stores to bring footfall to town and city centres.ldquoWith the pressure on shops as great as at any time this century, it really is a case of use it or lose it for local businesses right now.Colin Borland, director of devolved nations at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ldquoNews that two-thirds of Scots are going to make shopping local their priority in our newly-reopened high streets and town centres will be music to the ears of independent traders. Theyrsquove had a long, tough lockdown and public support is going to be more important than ever. Itrsquos great to see that the general public really appreciate the importance of their role in getting us back to business.ldquoThings will be dferent, but itrsquoll just take one trip back to your hairdresser, favourite cafeacute or your local to remind you why you love going there, to remind you of the personal, expert service you can only get from a local small business.Borland added that that customers and employees must be given the confidence they need to get back out there, generate some footfall, and get money moving around again.He added: ldquoThe message has to be clear: by going out for that first pint or haircut in four months, yoursquore doing your bit to get the country back on its feet.ldquoYou canrsquot have strong local communities without strong local economies. And any successful local economy needs a broad range of local small businesses.Borland hopes there is a way to bridge the -point gap between the % who say that itrsquos vital that the general public support their local high street and the % who say they will personally prioritise shopping there.He added: ldquoWe now need to work on those who accept that itrsquos vital that the general public support their local high street, but wonrsquot necessarily do so themselves. They need to feel that itrsquos safe and convenient.ldquoThe future of the high street lies in meeting and surpassing the needs and expectations of todayrsquos consumers ndash just as it did before coronavirus hit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-calls-snp-unite-ahead-holyrood-election","story":"The First Minster argued that support for an independent Scotland has grown during lockdown as people have watched the Scottish Governments decision making with the powers it has.In an interview withScotland on Sunday to mark her th birthday, Ms Sturgeon said devoting all her attention to dealing with the coronavirus has been \"liberating\" without the usual focus devoted to party politics.:Latest poll finds support for Scottish independence at %\"I have tried - in a way that I have never had to do with other issues - to strip the traditional rules of politics out of my decision-making,\" she said.\"I have not weighed up decisions over coronavirus in terms of: What does this mean for my party  What does it mean for opinion poll ratings  What does it mean for the next election  What does it mean for what the opposition are going to say about me tomorrow or next month  I have tried to do everything with a very straight bat to listen to the expert advice and apply best judgment.\"Ms Sturgeon added: \"I havent at any point during the coronavirus weighed up decisions on the basis of: Does this make independence more or less likely :Clap for Nicola Sturgeon: What is it, when is it and what time are people taking part \"But the Yes movement possibly has something to learn about the fact that - as we have stopped shouting about independence, and shouting to ourselves about how we go about getting independence, and just focused on [dealing with the crisis] - it has allowed people to take a step back and say: Well, actually thats the benefit of autonomous decision-making and also perhaps things would be betterwe had a bit more autonomous decision-making, and to come to their own conclusions.\"Her comments came before the launch of a new party was announced by former SNP MSP Dave Thompson in an attempt to woo pro-independence voters for Holyroods regional \"list\" seats at next years election, arguing that votes for the SNP are wasted under the Scottish Parliaments electoral system.:Former SNP MSP Dave Thompson to quit party to form new party, Alliance for IndependenceHe tweeted that the new Alliance for Independence party would \"ask all small indy parties to stand under our umbrella and unite to achieve Indy\", adding that it would be a \"formidable force\".Ms Sturgeon insisted that she wants the SNP \"united\" ahead of the  election and said: \"History is littered with examples of political parties that start talking to each other as opposed to the public.

He explained: ldquoGeology, geophysics and allied subjects are normally thought to be the pathway into a career in geology and quite a substantial subset of that would go into industry including oil and gas.ldquoGeoscience plays into a much larger, very relevant area too in terms of low-carbon energy transition, and the challenge of meeting the very ambitious net zero emissions targets that are there.ldquoUnfortunately for some people, geology is seen as a sort of old-fashioned subject, and very closely associated with extractive or fossil fuel industries in terms of employment.ldquoThat has definitely created a negative perception, as opposed to thinking about it in terms of understanding the landscape, the skill sets one needs to describe a subsurface, and then to use those skills to best effect for the energy transition plans and to help tackle climate change.Since , the number of people studying geosciences in the UK has fallen by %, and those doing so at Scottish universities has also declined.The number of Scots studying the subject has also likely fallen, according to Underhill, due to the removal of Higher geology from the Scottish curriculum in .He explained: ldquoBack in  there were  students at school doing Higher geology. If we fast-forward to about  there were , then  in ,  in , and then Higher geology stopped in . Itrsquos not part of the national curriculum anymore here in Scotland. ldquoThere are the consequences of that, quite apart from the negative perception around some geosciences being linked to fossil fuels, extraction. The knock-on effect is that in , we had  students come to do geoscience in Scotland.ldquoThat declined to in .The academic also cited figures relating to one leading university, where just  UK students had applied to study masters degrees in petroleum geosciences in , compared to around  UK students four years earlier.He explained: ldquoSome of these courses really need to be repurposed to make themselves relevant to the particular challenge of climate change and net zero emissions. ldquoIf we were to able to do so, but also promote the message across schools and undergraduate degrees as well, wersquoll see more students come through to do those topics.ldquoI think itrsquos essential to teach younger people that the skill set that one learns in doing geoscience and understanding the subsurface is absolutely essentialwersquore going to store carbon safely, or hydrogen, do geothermal, place windfarms in the right place in the North Sea ... It all comes into that mix. ldquoThe same skills and expertise are needed, and it needs to be repurposed towards low carbon. That will be the only way I think we can redress what seems to be an exponential decline in numbers. We have to show that the subject is relevant, and in fact essential.ldquoIf yoursquore going to make something so important to the Scottish economy, in terms of the energy transition, to have that on the curriculum is really important.ldquoUnless you come from the northeast, for example Aberdeen, and have more of a knowledge of the subject, then you might not go in that direction anyway. But even then you may not be able to do so because therersquos no Higher in geology in Scotland. Does that mean that they have to do A-levels where Along with the falling in interest in geology in general, the rise in climate change awareness and activism has also contributed further to the malaise for the subject.In , Greta Thunberg famously began protesting outside the Swedish parliament ndash a move which snowballed into the fight against climate change familiar across the globe.The issue has become particularly relevant for school-age children who have joined protests on school days and taken part in marches all over the country.While the rise in awareness of climate change has been welcomed, the misconceptions about how oil and gas fit into a climate-friendly future have done little to help the sector.Underhill explained: ldquoWersquove got to go out there, be proactive and explain what the career pathway is, and how relevant it is to those young folk today who are concerned, and rightly so, about the environment and climate change.ldquoWe should perhaps also produce more of an educational program so that folk understand where energy comes from, and some of the challenges that are ahead.ldquoThe fact that we were self-sufficient in oil and gas, but that has declined and wersquore reliant on one gas field in Norway, on Russian imports etc.According to a Committee on Climate Change report on Scottish oil and gas in , there could still be a role for the sector by  and beyond. But with fewer people available to work in it and conduct new exploration activity, Scotland would either fail to meet its climate targets or the industry would become extinct entirely."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-overwhelmed-celebrates-50th-birthday","story":"In a post on Twitter, which ended with a love heart emoji, Ms Sturgeon wrote: \"To say Im overwhelmed by all the cards, flowers and good wishes I have received from across the country for myth birthday, would be an understatement...so I just wanted to pop on here brieflyto say thank you.\":Nicola Sturgeon calls on SNP to unite ahead of Holyrood electionTo say Irsquom overwhelmed by all the cards, flowers and good wishes I have received from across the country for myth birthday, would be an understatement...so I just wanted to pop on here brieflyto say thank you ##On Sunday morning, husband and SNP chief executive Peter Murrell posted a tweet showing large, helium-filled balloons shaped in the number , captioned with a love heart emoji and \"Wakey Wakey @NicolaSturgeon\"."},{"url":null,"title":"eu-leaders-extend-summit-haggle-budget-virus","story":"However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the summit of  leaders could still end without a deal.The bitter negotiations, which are taking place amid the unprecedented crisis of the coronavirus pandemic, have underscored the deep fissures within the -nation bloc, with the traditional Franco-German alliance struggling to get its way.ldquoWhether there will be a solution, I still canrsquot say, Mrs Merkel said as she arrived early for the extra day of talks at what had been planned as a two-day summit in Brussels.ldquoThere is a lot of goodwill, but there are also a lot of positions.

These MSPs are elected by first past the postsystem, the same voting system which is used in Westminster. Simply put, the MSP with the most votes is elected. in exactly the same way as MPs are elected to Westminster. The constituency vote is sometimes referred to as the electors first vote. However, due to the nature of FPTP not being proportional , a counterbalance is created in the voting system with a more proportional outcome.The Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support.:Nicola Sturgeon calls on SNP to unite ahead of Holyrood electionWhat is a list vote and how does it work Under the system used in Scotland, voters have two votes. The constituency MSP is elected under the First Past the Post system. The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs. In the second vote the voter votes for a party rather than a candidate. The parties are then allocated a number of additional members to make the overall result more proportional. The regional MSPs are selected from lists compiled by the parties. These MSPs are sometimes referred to as List MSPs.Is AMS proportional AMS is not entirely proportional but doesmore accurate results than a system such as FPTP. In  for example the SNP polled around % of the vote over both ballots but ed % of the MSPs. However, the system was introduced in an attempt to make it more dficult for parties to have an overall majority and to encourage parties working together in coalition or lsquoking-makerrsquo governments.Why is there such interest in the use of the regional vote In , the SNP won  FPTP seats and ed just four list seats, with some arguing that the list vote hindered the party obtaining more seats as they had won the majority of FPTP votes. However, the real catalyst for the discussion around the list vote in the build-up to the  election is due to the creation of pro-independence parties. Many are discussing the idea of voting for the SNP but using their list vote to provide a lsquopro-independence majorityrsquo at Holyrood.While some argue that this would put independence at the heart of Scottish politics, others believe that it could hinder the independence campaigning message. However, in reality, it is not an entirely new idea to try and use the list system to promote a message.

Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday is on next week. Should the rest do likewise Traditionally the Sunday shows have taken their cue from politics. When parliaments rise, the Sunday shows follow, though they doearlier in autumn to catch the party conferences.As both Marr and Ridge on Sunday demonstrated, the world does not stop turning in the meantime.Marr went full throttle on the international front, interviewing not one but two ambassadors to the UK. At times it felt like televisionrsquos equivalent of the fabled ambassadorrsquos reception, albeit without the tower of Ferrero Rocher.First to arrive was Liu Xiaoming, Chinarsquos ambassador to the UK. There was much to discuss, including the new national security law being imposed on Hong Kong, and the exclusion of Huawei from the UKrsquos G network.The most extraordinary moment came when Marr raised the treatment of the Uighur in Xinjiang province. On the screen appeared images of people kneeling and blindfolded before being led to trains.The ambassador questioned where the video had come from, and denied a claim that the population of the province had plummeted. On the contrary, he said, it had doubled.The ambassador had a message for Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who was due on the show later and who will be making a statement to the Commons today on Hong Kong. Should there be any move to sanction Chinese officials over the Uighur people, said the ambassador, Beijing would make a ldquoresolute response.ldquoYou have seen what happened between Chinathe United States. They sanctioned Chinese officials, we sanctioned their senators, their officials. I do not want to see this tit-for-tat between China-US happen in China-UK relations.It was wrong to say China had changed and become more aggressive in its foreign policy, he told Marr. It was the United States, he insisted, that had started this ldquonew Cold War.ldquoI think UK should have its own independent foreign policy rather than dance to the tune of the Americans like what happened to Huawei.Later, Mr Raab said it was clear that ldquogross, egregious human rights abuses were being perpetrated against the Uighur people, and the UK was determined to ldquocall out such behaviour.The morningrsquos other fascinating diplomatic encounter actually took place last Friday, when Marr visited the Russian embassy to interview Andrei Kelin, the countryrsquos new ambassador to the UK.The Commonsrsquo Intelligence and Security Committee is expected to publish its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics by Wednesday. Among the subjects to be covered is the  referendum on Scottish independence.ldquoAre you as a government interested in the cause of Scottish nationalism  asked Marr.ldquoOur interest in Scotland is only one ndash we are open for business, came the reply.ldquoThe reason I ask, pressed Marr, ldquois that there are many people in this Government, and the Conservative Party at least, who feel that Russia is enthusiastic about breaking up the UK.ldquoInteresting idea, said Mr Kelin, laughing. ldquoVery frankly I do not believe that Scotland will withdraw from [the] United Kingdom.Marr took an odd way in to the subject of the Salisbury poisonings when he askedthe ambassador had seen the three-part BBC drama about the real-le novichok attack in .The ambassador said he started watching, but the programme was ldquoso dull he could not make it to the end of the first episode. Colleagues had watched it and told him about it, though.As for interfering in British politics, Russia had no interest in such things.ldquoWe do not see any point in interference because for us, whether it will beConservative Party or Labourrsquos party at the head of this country, we will try to settle relations and to establish better relations than now.Spoken like a true diplomat."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmEnquiries are continuing into the sudden death of a man in Kirkwall yesterday afternoon.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online. Businesses across the UK are assessed according to their respective national guidance including the social distancing and cleanliness protocols that must be in place. vw, px\"  For more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The public are being encouraged to protect public health and our precious environment.The new Scottish Outdoor Access Code advice includes reminders to:Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: “We very much want this love affair with Scotland’s great outdoors and nature to continue. But let’s not spoil it for others. We need be kind to nature and respectful to each other by clearing up after ourselves and taking all of our litter home with us. The scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees, human waste, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Scotland’s reputation.”Around half of the people surveyed said that they expect to take more visits to the outdoors after lockdown than before the crisis. It is also expected that many will replace cancelled trips abroad with holidays in Scotland this year, so you may arrive somewhere to find it busier than expected. The advice from Scottish Government is to have a back-up plan, andthis happens to you, move on and find somewhere quieter and safer.All of the latest COVID- guidance can be found on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website. The website includes information about our rights and responsibilities when outdoors, as well as specic guides for a range of activities, from air and water sports, to hillwalking and wild camping.Francesca added: “If we all follow Scottish Government advice and the Scottish Outdoor Access code, we will be doing our bit to ensure that Scotland’s outdoors remains beautul and that COVID- restrictions can continue to be relaxed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However the quality of the census data must remain robust, and by moving to  National Records of Scotland can continue to deliver a census which ensures the highest possible response rate from people across Scotland, to allow government, local authorities and key services plan for every element of public le, from building homes to NHS support.“NRS will continue to work closely with stakeholders and partners to ensure that appropriate data is available to support work that was expecting to make use of Census  data, particularly for key funding allocations and policy decisions.”Paul Lowe, registrar general and chief executive of NRS, added: “The priority and responsibility of NRS is to put in place a census that enables everyone across Scotland to participate, so that information collected can be used to produce the analyses and deliver the benefits required by the people of Scotland.“The census is a unique count of every household in Scotland and in the next census, for the first time, the majority of people will be encouraged to complete their questionnaire online. This will require a signicant field force and face-to-face engagement in an effort to support digital participation, engage with the public and raise awareness of census across the population.“The census is a major logistical operation and the twelve months running up to a census are vital in planning and testing the effectiveness and security of systems and processes. COVID- restrictions have delayed or prevented many of these key activities, including engagement with key organisations, from taking place over recent months.“This is the right decision for Scotland which will allow us to undertake a high quality and safe census in  that will produce the rich data we need for many years to come. That remains our absolute priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If they do not apply for a registration or stop activities, SEPA will take enforcement action which could see them subjected to fines or criminal prosecution.There is also an important role for the public, with a warning that the use of unlicensed waste collectors could result in waste contributing to fly-tipping and other illegal activity.“Don’t engage the services of people who are not authorised,” Ms Shearer explained.“Remember, services that sound too good to be true often are, and could lead to your waste being illegally fly-tipped or disposed of by other illegitimate means.“Anyone offering to take your waste away should be able to provide a waste carrier registration number and tell you the named facility they will take the waste to –they can’t provide this information, don’t allow them to take your waste.“Now more than ever, Scots are recognising the importance of local services like recycling and the part we all play in correctly managing our waste. You have the responsibility to take care of your waste andwe trace it back to you we can take enforcement action against you too. We don’t want people to be put in that situation so make sure that anyone who takes your waste for disposal is properly accredited.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People also had to keep a safe distance while waiting their turn.Mr Assad and his we Asma, both wearing masks, voted on Sunday morning in Damascus at the Ministry of Presidential Affairs.Information minister Imad Sarah said the vote ldquoemphasises the cohesion of the Syrian homeland, that after nine years of war, Syria will not kneel.Mr Assad has twice postponed the countryrsquos parliamentary elections this year in light of restrictions in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

But it is a start, and for many youngsters stuck at home for months it will represent another big step towards normality.The lack of social interaction has been one of the big psychological burdens enforced by Covid-.As we continue to move through the lockdown route map, let#s hope that when sports like shinty do eventuallythey are embraced with gusto by players – and their communities – as never before.Research, commissioned by Skye Connect and carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University, revealed that in the year before Covid- visitors to Skye brought £ million to the economy, and helped support , jobs.But Professor John Lennon, Director of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism and the lead author of the report, also had a warning.“Skye is highly vulnerable to the downturn in international visitors that will continue for much of  and beyond,” he said.“Restrictions on access and reduction in air connectivity will impact on visitation.“The island does benefit from direct road access which will hopefully help catalyse greater domestic visitation – which is likely to characterise visitation for the remainder of the year.”In short Skye, and by extension the wider west Highlands, needs tourists and the region’s economy would collapse without them.But as many former industrialised parts of the country would confirm – over-reliance on a single sector can also carry signicant risk.In future years this area will need alternatives.We might also need to question the type of tourism which has come to characterise the region, and ask whether all the benefits are being as widely shared as they could be.To use one obvious example, many of those heading north and west in the weeks ahead will be coming to stay in houses – perhaps rented at upwards of £ a week – that are owned by people who live hundreds of miles away.Meanwhile, small hotels, guest houses and BBs – which provide local employment – are considering closing their doors as they find the burden of Covid-related regulations simply too onerous to make their business viable for the year ahead.If, as seems likely, Covid- accelerates an existing trend for visitors to seek self catering, rather than serviced accommodation, then the question of who benefits is worth scrutiny.A chalet on the bottom of the croft, put in to supplement modest family income, means money flows into the local economy.Houses hoovered up by letting companies, or let for  weeks of the year by someone who might visit for the other two, results in money flowing out, while the availablity and affordability of housing is limited further.In the most dficult of years all those involved in the local tourist trade deserve good wishes for the weeks and months ahead.But let’s hope there are lessons to be heeded for the future.As SkyeConnect’s project manager, Alistair Danter said this week: “We need to reset and reshape tourism for the new world and encourage a more sustainable approach that provides visitors with an immersive experience while ensuring that the island and its communities see the benefits of a tourism economy.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine publishes the text for Ruairidh‘s “Letter to Gaelic Learners” on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-. More information on testing is available on the PHA website.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3236563.jpg--.jpg?1594988997000\n","title":"royal irish ceremony is postponed","story":" A ceremony to honour the Royal Irish Regiment, which had been due to be held next month in Ballymena, will now take place in Spring , elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have agreed.A ceremony to honour the Royal Irish Regiment, which had been due to be held next month in Ballymena, will now take place in Spring , elected members on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have agreed.The Laying of the Retired Colours of the First Battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment had been planned for August when the regiment would also have exercised their right, as Freemen of the Borough, to parade the town.However, due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, plans have been placed on hold until Spring of next year.Speaking at the monthly meeting of Full Council, Mayor Cllr Peter Johnston, said:“This ceremony had been scheduled to take place during August this year.“Unfortunately, due to the onset of the Covid- pandemic, and the critical role which all the services in the Armed Forces have and continue to provide, as part of the UK Government’s response to the pandemic, it has been agreed with the Royal Irish Regiment to postpone the Laying of the Retired Colours to .“Planning will now commence with the Royal Irish Regiment to hold the Laying of the Retired Colours ceremony in Spring .” "},{"url":null,"title":"limavady cluster is a timely reminder that covid 19 hasnt","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricescoupon_codeSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",template_redeem_coupon_code: Redeem your SubscriptionEnter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

This is precisely why hymns have been banned at church services.And so, the number of diagnosed cases is now beginning to rise again - as of Friday, there were  more confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, with  people testing positive for the virus in the Causeway Coast and Glens area over the past seven days.It is clear that Limavady and the surrounding areas are now at the centre of Covid- spike, the full effects of which cannot yet be predicted.It#s certainly a matter of consternation for people living in the area who are regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus, coming just weeks before shielding is paused.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itselfIt is also fair to surmise that the virus may have travelled over the mountain towards Coleraine, Portrush and potentially beyond. This will, of course, have implications given the fact the North Coast is a popular day trip destination for people from all over.Health officials are currently undertaking a trace, test and isolate programme to try and halt the spread of Covid-, but the system itself has limitations.Experts have conceded that it isn#t always possible to track everyone down and so we must be prepared for the possibility that the number of positive cases may continue to rise in the coming days - even beyond Limavady itself.And with an increase in cases, there is a growing likelihood that more people will require hospital treatment.Of course, we don#t know the ages and medical history of all of those who have been infected, but it isn#t too far a leap to say that someone may even lose their le.It is a sobering thought, but it is the tragic reality now that Covid- is endemic in the community.Looking back, the Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer have warned that complacency cannot be allowed to set in and commenting on the Limavady cluster on Thursday, Robin Swann said he was not surprised by the outbreak.Health officials have said repeatedly that this would happen as social distancing measures were relaxed and on Friday, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s NI Council, said we will continue to see similar outbreaks in the coming months.However, the future is very much in our hands it is our responsibility to keep each other safe.There are so many measures we can adopt to stop the spread of the virus.Frequent handwashing, maintaining an appropriate distance from others, and wearing a face covering in an enclosed space - they will all go some way to slow the spread of Covid-.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading forThe cluster in Limavady is a warning shot and it is welcome that some local organisations are taking it seriously, with  Derry GAA clubs suspending activity as a precautionary measure.There has even been talk of a local lockdown, and it is a very real possibilitythe number of cases diagnosed in the area continues on the same trajectory.No one wants toto the full lockdown that was put in place in March butwe can#t bring clusters like these under control, then that is what we are heading for.Doctors and scientists have warned that this is a potentially more dangerous period than during the original outbreak.There is no doubt that complacency has set in, there is a certain fatigue with social distancing.The fact that we haven#t experienced the predicted thousands of fatalities has to some extent contributed to this.However, the cluster in Limavady should act as a reminder that Covid- is as dangerous and as insidious as ever.

Paul Faith PA Wire FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe local housing market has rebounded after lockdown. Paul Faith PA WireBy Lauren HarteJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEstate agents in Northern Ireland have reported bumper sales and record viewing numbers since the housing market here reopened last month. While business came to a standstill during the height of the lockdown, since June  buyer demand has soared thanks to those wanting to trade up or down after a three-month shutdown.The market reopened to a new era of socially distanced viewings and uncertainty about the impact of an economic recession.New working practices have included inidual viewings in  minute slots with wiping down of touch points in between them, and valuations carried out using PPE. With remote working from home set to remain the norm for the foreseeable future, estate agents are experiencing a huge demand for homes with enough room to create an office and additional garden space. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDemand: Tfany Brien FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDemand: Tfany BrienTfany Brien, associate director of Simon Brien estate agents, said the demand is right across the market in terms of both geographical spread and price bands.During the lockdown, there was a phenomenal level of enquiries coming through via web enquiries and following on from virtual viewings - an area where we have invested in and which is being very well received by house buyers - particularly with new homes, she said. It is evident that many people made the decision that their house apartment garden was too small or maybe too large and many made the decision that they want to move post-lockdown, hence the pent up demand.In the first three weeks of opening since lockdown, we have agreed  houses for sale, which would be one of our busiest periods in the past two years.There are also a lot of requests for valuations which again is positive as many people want to get their houses on the market in order to prepare for a move, so it is likely that there will be more choice for house buyers.Interest rates are likely to be low for a considerable period so buyers will be able to avail of favourable two and five year mortgage products. In addition, more lenders are now ing to the market with % mortgage products.Tfany added that the recent announcement by Chancellor Rishi Sunak of a stamp duty holiday up to £, will be a massive boost for house buyers with a saving of £, on a £, purchase.It is a similar story for Art O#Hagan of Armagh-based estate agency CPS who has had a very buoyant four weeks. We#ve seen lots of sales and genuine buyers looking to move so the pent up demand has certainly been there, he said. Anything we have with larger gardens, semi-rural locations and improved wi quality for those continuing to work from home has got between five and ten percent above market value. We have had  sales agreed to date and over  viewings in the diary for this coming week.

A spokesperson from SONI denied the payments in Northern Ireland were excessive, and said a long-term strategy including progressing the North-South interconnector in Ireland would steadily reduce costs for customers.Mr Wells, a DUP MLA who has had the party whip withdrawn, said: This is basically wind farm owners being paidto do nothing. In the initial surge to get people signed up to wind farms and green energy, the incentives were extremely attractive.He said operators should no longer be compensated for quieter periods, given the relatively low costs after start-up. Each farmer gets a payment of £, per turbine a year for  years for the land they rent the turbines on.He added: I do think it#s time to review these contracts to make sure they meet the needs of the real world.REF director Dr John Constable pointed to a weakness in Scotland#s grid system that has already caused an excessive expansion in wind farms, resulting in large constraint payouts. Mr Constable added: I agree these constraint payments should never have been paid at all, it#s just a mistake. One thing you could say is that constraint payments are just getting going in Northern Ireland.Wind farms are still being built so it#s only going to get worse and the scale of the problem is very large.The constraints so far in the GB system in  has already cost £.m. You really don#t want to head that way in Northern Ireland.SONI spokesperson Natasha Sayee said it was necessary to limit wind energy on occasions for safety and security reasons, with windfarms owners compensated for the electricity they planned to sell.She explained that a signicant amount of work has taken place to improve Northern Ireland#s grid system and minimise constraints.At present, the grid carries up to % renewable energy at any one time, with a target to increase this to % by .There has also been investment in the Curraghmulkin project in Tyrone and the Brockaghboy kV line near Garvagh which connects clusters of windfarms to the transmission grid. During the first three months of this year, she added there was % more wind generation in Northern Ireland and % more available wind energy than in the same period last year.She said the North South Interconnector would also be a game-changer in maximising efficiency.In doing so it will also reduce costs to consumers across the island of approximately £m annually, rising to £m in savings by .She added that investing in technologies such as battery storage to hold excess wind energy would allow more upgrades for future generations.Steven Agnew, head of the NI Renewable Industries Group , said renewable energies had saved NI consumers £m since .With % of its electricity coming from renewables, Northern Ireland is a leader in the type of low-carbon energy generation that will play a key role in our green economic recovery, he said.He called constraints an unfortunate consequence of a small island system that was paid to all forms of generation.In renewables, he said this was more than compensated for due to reduced wholesale prices.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings.

Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The campaign, run by Retail NI, is part of ‘Independents’ Month’, which celebrates the ersity of independent retail in Northern Ireland. County Derry has a wide range of independent retailers in its town centres of Maghera and Magherafelt, as well as the surrounding villages and towns. Customers can say thank you to their favourite retailer by lending them their vote, while there is also an opportunity to recognise efforts made by retailers during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Cathal Mallaghan, encouraged residents to engage with the campaign. “The Mid Ulster district is renowned for its niche selection of independent retailers right across our five town centres and villages,” he said. “Following the extremely dficult and uncertain  months these retailers have experienced, we owe it to them to get behind them and not only cast our vote but to also illustrate our support in numbers by ing to our towns and villages and shopping local. “Many retailers went way above and beyond what was expected to continue to provide the excellent service we were accustomed to even in the most testing of circumstances. googletag.cmd.push “Now we are on the road to recovery I would call on all Mid Ulster residents to ‘reconnect with retail’ and rediscover our towns and villages, not only on Independents’ Day but all throughout the year, our local retailers depend on it.” Votes can be cast online until noon on Friday, July .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it. Itrsquos something special we designed and built as a family and now use as a family. Itrsquos a special place because we all have invested our time, love and effort into it.However, there are no plans to rule out trips to the cinema after they are allowed to reopen.Jacqueline added: ldquoWe will continue to support our local cinema. Our home cinema is great but therersquos nothing like the real thingThe movie theatre, whether it be modern or old-style, is a magical place and I hope we all continue going to the movies and supporting our cinemas for many years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former council chairman  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former SDLP councillor Patsy Toman who sadly passed away last week.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council. Patsy was a true Gael and was involved in the cultural and Scor activities of his home club.ldquoWhen I worked with the late Eddie McGrady MP, Patsy used to call into the Downpatrick constituency office every Monday and would have met up with the late Cllr Peter Craig.ldquoThere was fierce rivalry between the Saul and Loughinisland GAA teams and those matches were fought out again in the Scotch Street office and latterly in Saul Street, with Patsy and Peter also glorying in the fortunes of the Down GAA team in the early s.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman always put the needs of people first, with this clearly reflected in the background work he did on behalf of the Loughinisland families following the  massacre at The Heights Bar in the village.ldquoPatsy was shaken with emotion and grief about the killing of six innocent men and the images of that night on June  lasted with him until he was overtaken by his illness and his untimely death. He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

The specic timings for reopening may y from place to place as owners take assessments and make any necessary changes.ldquoAs we take these cautious steps, no one should make the mistake of thinking the virus has gone away. We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.The Welsh Government has previously asked a number of businesses to begin preparing to reopen from July ,the conditions allow.These are as follows:bull Close contact services, including nail and beauty salons and businesses providing tanning services, massages, body piercings, tattooing, electrolysis or acupuncture.bull Indoor cinemas, museums, galleries and archive services.bull Tourist accommodation with shared facilities, such as camping sites. Opening would be from July .bull Reopening the housing market fully.Provided the reopening of these sectors goes well and conditions allow, indoor opening for pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will resume from August , following the outcome of the next review of the coronavirus regulations. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He says he would usually have queues around the corner.ldquoThey put bollards in my loading bay on Tuesday morning, he said, ldquoI was annoyed but I was informed they could be removed, as they were screwed in.ldquoKnowing this, I did screw them out to allow for my morning deliveries, of which I have many and the drivers need to park close to the shop to carry the produce on their shoulders.ldquoI was shocked on Wednesday morning when someone from the council turned up to stick the bollards to the floor so I could no longer remove them.ldquoIt means my delivery drivers are having to carry huge amounts of produce on their back for well over an hour, when it would usually take about  minutes.ldquoItrsquos unsustainable and inhumane. It also means our business isnrsquot efficient.The Vale council says the measures were implemented based on government guidance and discussion with representatives of tradersrsquo groups in Penarth, as well as the town council.Shoppers have said they have been going where due to the restrictions, and it is deterring them for shopping locally, while others have said it could be a good thing for the town.Cllr Lis Burnett, Vale of Glamorgan Council Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, said: ldquoThe safety of shoppers visiting town centres in the Vale is our number one priority and so measures designed to promote social distancing and protect people have been introduced in these locations.ldquoThis has involved removing some parking bays in order to create more safe space for pedestrians at pinch points in the towns.ldquoThe new more stream-lined fixed bollards are less overpowering in the street scene and after the most recent review the number of parking bays affected has been reduced to specic pinch-points.ldquoWe continue to meet with town councils and business representatives and will regularly review the measures to ensure they reflect the changing situation in our shopping centres. In this way we hope to support local businesses while encouraging shoppers towith confidence to town centres.Mr Lush says to add salt to the wound, since parking restrictions have been put in place, he has seen a noticeable decrease in sales, and this Saturday was one of the quietest he has seen.       ,params: .pushldquoWersquove tried our best through lockdown to remain open and serve the town as well as we can, and I find it very sad that this is how wersquove been repaid by the council, he added., compared to now\" alt\"Penarth Times: Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to now\" class\"editor-image\"Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to nowEmily Hillier, a resident who regularly drives into the town centre to shop, said she was ldquostunned by the bollards when she arrived to do some shopping on Wednesday.ldquoI wasnrsquot the only one either, she said. ldquoSo many people were saying the same thing ndash stood around just bemused by these plans.ldquoI try to use local shops as much as I can, but Irsquove never felt so discouraged to support local shops as a consumer.ldquoItrsquos so sad that we are being discouraged at a time when these local shops need all the help they can get.Ms Hillier said she believes the council should be using the money to fund parking in the town instead, and should allow Penarthrsquos residents to ldquouse their common sense to socially distance.She added that her friends have driven to the town centre this week, and have gone to the supermarket instead because they couldnrsquot find a parking space.The restrictions have garnered some support in the town too, however, and earlier this week members of Penarth Civic Society and Gwyrddio Penarth Greeningsaid they backed a partial pedestrianisation of some of the major pinch points in the town, to allow eateries to operate outdoors.The topic was on the agenda at a town council meeting two weeks ago, and a survey has been rolled out on the council website asking for residentsrsquo views.Gideon Calder of GPG said: ldquoOur town centre needs our support, and whats vital is that people feel safe to visit, spend more time in our town centre, and make the most of our local shops and cafeacutes.Anne Evans of Penarth Civic Society added: ldquoThese proposals would provide safe pedestrian zones to help increase footfall in the town centre, ensure that there is vital outdoor space for cafeacutes and restaurants, and increase the amount of town centre parking. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
