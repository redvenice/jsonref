Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle (pictured right last week) is recovering from heart surgery and will now not attend the wedding  Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria    The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.          Police marksmen on the ground and on rooftops have to do \u0027whatever it takes\u0027 to keep people safe tomorrowIn return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

Everyone will already know most of what to expect as the order of service is being released at midnight on Friday.1pmThe newlyweds will emerge about an hour later at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/22/4C6020FF00000578-0-image-a-9_1526591140002.jpg","title":"Corbyn U turns make Martha Osamor peer","story":"Jeremy Corbyn (pictured left) has made left-wing activist Martha Osmaor (pictured left) to the House of Lords - U-turning on his pledge not to create any new Labour peersTheresa May says it is \u0027unacceptable\u0027 for Commons speaker...Share this article    The House of Lords is the world\u0027s second largest parliamentary Chamber - only behind China\u0027s National People\u0027s Congress.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsalSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in WindsorThe Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal wedding\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decision\u0027I\u0027m off to the pub\u0027: Prince Harry greets crowd in WindsorRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before wedding\u0027I was raped by Harvey Weinstein\u0027 says Asia Argento in Cannes speechChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arrivePrince Harry and Meghan Markle make their wedding declarationsIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.The Queen is seen driving to Windsor ahead of royal wedding\u0027I\u0027m off to the pub\u0027: Prince Harry greets crowd in WindsorPrince Harry and Meghan ready for wedding rehearsal in Windsor\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at Windsor Castle for rehearsal\u0027I was raped by Harvey Weinstein\u0027 says Asia Argento in Cannes speechChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveEmotional Royal wedding: Doria Ragland is reassured by Prince HarryThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C657D1100000578-5745179-image-a-17_1526653536757.jpg","title":"Frail Yoko Ono visits John Lennons childhood homes Liverpool","story":"Yoko Ono visited Liverpool on Friday in order to open a new exhibition dedicated to her relationship with John Lennon before spending some time at two of his childhood homes, including Mendips (pictured)          Lennon moved to Mendips, at 251 Menlove Avenue, after his parents\u0027 marriage broke down.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth. So why can\u0027t the Left stop whingeing about Britain?The useful idiot: Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s assignations with a secret agent were part of the gullible British Left\u0027s love affair with a totalitarian Russian regime that murdered millions, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK Pilloried for speaking sense?

A new Loony Left council. We’ve forgotten the lessons of history!I voted Remain. But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/14/4C224B3700000578-0-image-m-29_1526132426322.jpg","title":"Marks Spencer plot home delivery service bring food drink door hour","story":"    Marks \u0026amp Spencer is rumoured to be looking at launching a home delivery service for food in response to a surge in online grocery shoppingTo date, M\u0026ampS has shied away from going ahead because the service is massively expensive to run and will seriously erode profit margins, despite the income from delivery charges.One problem that M\u0026ampS has is that people typically shop for a small basket of premium items, rather than doing a full weekly shop.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6E005B00000578-5747477-image-a-332_1526732894449.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Meghan looks like a nice person, though.\u0027 The final days before her sister\u0027s wedding were turbulent for Samantha Markle.She made a series of television appearances, including a bruising confrontation on Good Morning Britain with Dailymail.com columnist Piers Morgan.He called her a \u0027little vulture\u0027 and asked her: \u0027How much money have you made from trashing Meghan Markle?\u0027 to which Samantha replied: \u0027Not very much\u0027.Markle said she had encouraged her father to do a deal with paparazzi claiming he had been treated \u0027shabbily\u0027 by the media.Whether that is true remains unclear, as her father gave a version of events to TMZ which made no mention of her involvement.Then she claimed on Thursday - again to TMZ - that she had been involved in a confrontation with paparazzi while in a car driven by her boyfriend Mark Phillips.She claimed that a photographer veered in front of them near a toll booth, causing Phillips, 60, to swerve and hit a concrete barrier - and claimed she had a suspected broken ankle and fractured knee.But DailyMail.com diclosed that cops were baffled by her explosive claims.Officers from the Florida Highway Patrol spent three hours trawling their database for details - and after their search turned up empty they even warned Phillips, could be guilty of a hit and run misdemeanor - punishable by two months in jail - for failing to report an accident.               Fiery confrontation: Samantha Markle went head-to-head with DailyMail.com\u0027s Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain after her father was revealed to have co-operated with paparazzi - who she now claims caused her boyfriend to crash his car, leaving her injured          Fractured claims: Samantha Markle told TMZ that she had a \u0027paparazzi confrontation\u0027. She released a picture from an unnamed hospital and her partner claimed she had a broken ankle and possible fracture knee. But law enforcement can find no evidence of the crash she described          Claim: TMZ said that Samantha Markle was injured after Mark Phillips swerved into a barrier near a toll booth while trying to avoid a photographer who veered in front of them to get pictures.

Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake,\u0027 he said. He went on to share his \u0027fondest\u0027 memory of hs estranged half-sibling. \u0027My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two years prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time. \u0027She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody.

When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart.\u0027If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phone call.\u0027We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA.\u0027Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family,\u0027 he said. Considering himself an expert on the occasion, he predicted that the bride\u0027s dress would be \u0027the nicest dress anyone has ever seen\u0027.   Thomas\u0027s sister Samantha has also launched astonishing attacks on Meghan (seen together right in 2008)          On Saturday, Samantha continued her cashing-in crusade by inviting a TV crew round to her Ocala, Florida, home to watch the wedding \u0027The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. \u0027It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry. Her half-brother said on Friday that she is \u0027incredible\u0027 \u0027When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children.\u0027She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time. \u0027I wish them all the happiness in the world,\u0027 he said.The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visibly present at the wedding was her mother, Doria Ragland. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6E82FA00000578-5747793-image-m-61_1526738688843.jpg","title":"Kate arrives hand hand Meghans adorable flower girls page boys","story":"Dress your little princess in white like Charlotte in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy couture bridesmaid dressUnavailable to buy - click to browse the current collection by the deisgnerPrincess Charlotte always looks adorable, and her cuteness reached a whole new level in this gorgeous little flower girl dress.

Instead this week he was first in Rosarito, Mexico, where he lives and then, he told TMZ, in California recovering from heart surgeryBefore the wedding, Meghan\u0027s half-brother Thomas Jr. sent numerous letters to US magazines pleading with Prince Harry to call the whole thing off. Her half-sister, Samantha, gave similarly scathing attacks in a number of television interviews.Thomas Jr. has spent the week posing for photographs with British newspaper website The Mirror. On Friday, he said he regretted how he had treated Meghan and admitted feeling like an \u0027a**\u0027.Samantha, on the other hand, invited a TV crew round to her home in Ocala, Florida, to watch the televised service.Her partner said she likely received a hefty sum for the stunt. The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visible at her wedding was her mother, Doria.           Enough!

I don’t speak good English but I understood what he wanted me to do. The photographer he was with stepped back to the street and started taking pictures.\u0027The big man was showing me what to do with the tape, holding it across himself. I just went along with it.

You would not normally expect the Israeli Ambassador to agree with a terrorist organisation guilty of murdering his people and committed to destroying his country. But it’s true, I do.I agree with Hamas when its founder Mahmoud Al-Zahar admitted publicly that its strategy of labelling events in Gaza as ‘peaceful protests’ was a deliberate ‘deception’.He is right, because there is nothing peaceful about knives, machetes, guns, pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives: all of which the Palestinians used in their ‘peaceful protest’.I agree with Hamas’ leader, Yahya Sinwar, when he says that the purpose of the ongoing violence is to breach the frontier and indiscriminately murder Israelis living in communities nearby. Mr Sinwar proclaimed, ‘We will tear down the border’ and ‘tear out their hearts’.Video footage from last Monday shows a masked man who had just broken through the fence, carrying a machete while shouting: ‘O Jews, we’re coming to slaughter you!’ This was indeed Hamas’ goal.I also agree with Mr Sinwar when he revealed that Hamas operatives ‘took off their military uniforms’ in order to pose as innocent civilians. Unfortunately, all too many politicians and commentators in this country were successfully taken in by Hamas’ mendacious charade.          Some have accused Israel of a ‘calculated and deliberate policy to kill and maim unarmed protestors’. But I agree with Hamas politburo member Salah Bardawil, when he acknowledged that 50 of the 62 killed on Monday belonged to Hamas, said Mr Regev.

It’s also a way of thanking those who came here and helped make Britain strong by working on the railways or as nurses and doctors in the NHS.’ A model of the funnelled Windrush is the centrepiece of the £40,000, 30ft x 30ft floral display in the Grand Pavilion at the show, which opens to the public on Tuesday.Life in the Caribbean, the journey and the new life in Britain are depicted in the design, which features 3-D models of passengers playing dominoes and singing while crowded together on deck.A model train, bus, a nurse’s hat, keyboard letters and road signs represent jobs taken by the pioneers after settling here. The garden also features a reminder of Lady Benjamin’s past presenting Play School with the show’s famous square, round and arched windows hidden within a West Indian chapel house.Birmingham City Council’s Darren Share, who worked on the garden, said: ‘It’s bold and bright, with gold, yellow and orange provided by zinnias, celosias, marigolds for the Caribbean and antirrhinums, foxgloves, hydrangeas and gerberas for the British reds, whites and blues.’It will be recreated next month in Birmingham’s Handsworth Park.

I was one of the first black members of the Royal Household.

They have to learn history in a different way, seeing conflicts from all perspectives.The Royal Family’s role is to bring us together, and the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex truly reflect modern Britain and are a symbol of what can happen when people are allowed to meet and fall in love, without prejudice.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date.

Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech.

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.          Telling aides that they want to ‘hit the ground running’, Harry and Meghan will instead join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at his 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on TuesdayIt is hoped the pair will join Charles and Camilla and William and Kate in helping to exercise ‘soft power’ diplomacy.Meghan has already seen a great deal since her engagement to Harry. Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6E005B00000578-5747477-image-a-332_1526732894449.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake,\u0027 he said. He went on to share his \u0027fondest\u0027 memory of hs estranged half-sibling. \u0027My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two years prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time. \u0027She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody. Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake                        \u0027When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart.\u0027If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phone call.\u0027We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA.\u0027Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family,\u0027 he said. Considering himself an expert on the occasion, he predicted that the bride\u0027s dress would be \u0027the nicest dress anyone has ever seen\u0027.   Thomas\u0027s sister Samantha has also launched astonishing attacks on Meghan (seen together right in 2008)          On Saturday, Samantha continued her cashing-in crusade by inviting a TV crew round to her Ocala, Florida, home to watch the wedding \u0027The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. \u0027It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry. Her half-brother said on Friday that she is \u0027incredible\u0027 \u0027When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children.\u0027She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time. \u0027I wish them all the happiness in the world,\u0027 he said.The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visibly present at the wedding was her mother, Doria Ragland. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/02/4C74455A00000578-5747843-Crowds_gathered_by_Windsor_Castle_to_see_the_couple_emerge_after-m-6_1526778652756.jpg","title":"Meghan Harry delight fans leave Windsor chapel carriage","story":"    A satellite image of Windsor taken during the royal wedding as crowds gathered to see Harry and Meghan tie the knot          Crowds gathered by Windsor Castle to see the couple emerge after the service in St George\u0027s Chapel          The well wishers lining the streets of the town hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal couple           The satellite images show the enthusiastic crowds who thronged to the town to see Harry and Meghan          Prince Harry and his wife Meghan wave as they ride a horse-drawn carriage after their wedding ceremony          An aerial shot shows the massive crowds which lined the Long Walk east of Windsor Castle for the procession          Meghan Markle had a chance to practice her royal wave as she and her husband toured Windsor following their wedding  It is thought around 120,000 people are in Windsor today to cheer on the newly-wedded couple after their wedding          The couple delighted the assembled crowds by sharing a kiss as the carriage pulled along the packed streets of Windsor          The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead estimated just over 100,000 fans watched the procession along the route          Prince Harry and his new bride Meghan Markle toured a jubilant Windsor today following the wedding ceremony    Meghan looked touched by the massive turn-out for the occasion, with huge crowds cheering the couple around Windsor  Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

It’s also a way of thanking those who came here and helped make Britain strong by working on the railways or as nurses and doctors in the NHS.’ A model of the funnelled Windrush is the centrepiece of the £40,000, 30ft x 30ft floral display in the Grand Pavilion at the show, which opens to the public on Tuesday.Life in the Caribbean, the journey and the new life in Britain are depicted in the design, which features 3-D models of passengers playing dominoes and singing while crowded together on deck.A model train, bus, a nurse’s hat, keyboard letters and road signs represent jobs taken by the pioneers after settling here. The garden also features a reminder of Lady Benjamin’s past presenting Play School with the show’s famous square, round and arched windows hidden within a West Indian chapel house.Birmingham City Council’s Darren Share, who worked on the garden, said: ‘It’s bold and bright, with gold, yellow and orange provided by zinnias, celosias, marigolds for the Caribbean and antirrhinums, foxgloves, hydrangeas and gerberas for the British reds, whites and blues.’It will be recreated next month in Birmingham’s Handsworth Park.

I was one of the first black members of the Royal Household.          From the passionate address from the Most Reverend Michael Curry quoting Martin Luther King, to a swaying black gospel choir, it was a very modern blend of black and white, American and British – an event perfectly judged to represent the union of a Royal and his new, mixed-race bride          The gospel choir sang \u0027Stand By Me\u0027 and \u0027This Little Light of Mine\u0027 during the ceremony          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland with  Prince Charles and the Duchess of CornwallI was aware in the difficult days following the tragic death of Princess Diana that the Royal Family were criticised for failing to understand the public mood. The Queen recognised immediately that the Royal Family can exist only with the consent of the people and that listening to their views was vital. That acknowledgment was key to a marked shift in attitude.The Queen now has a black equerry and there are many ethnic minorities working at the Palace.

I was one of the first black members of the Royal HouseholdChange in organisations always comes from the top. And when the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family are seen to treat all staff with respect and fairness, others have to follow.Now the Royal Family has a mixed-race Duchess.Meghan will receive a warm embrace from all at the Palace, where those who matter can see the world is changing.When, as it is to be hoped, Harry and Meghan have children, they will be living embodiments of the British melting pot.Not only will they be both British and American, but they will be a blend of black and white and Meghan and Harry will see to it that their upbringing reflects who they are.Mixed-race people are the fastest growing ethnic group in the country but can sometimes feel marginalised and misunderstood, and having someone like Meghan talk about these issues could be just what’s required.My own mixed-race children have made clear to me how adopting one particular culture over another is not the answer. They have to learn history in a different way, seeing conflicts from all perspectives.The Royal Family’s role is to bring us together, and the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex truly reflect modern Britain and are a symbol of what can happen when people are allowed to meet and fall in love, without prejudice.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.          Telling aides that they want to ‘hit the ground running’, Harry and Meghan will instead join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at his 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on TuesdayIt is hoped the pair will join Charles and Camilla and William and Kate in helping to exercise ‘soft power’ diplomacy.Meghan has already seen a great deal since her engagement to Harry. Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants.“Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world. But under the surface, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Uber are pursuing an agenda that could hand them dangerous levels of control over our lives and profoundly harm economic development in the global south,” the report says.Industry bodies deny that there are moves to establish global rules that would force-feed western technology to developing-world countries. They say that e-commerce liberates small and medium-sized businesses to export goods they could never previously afford to sell. They also say that states’ attempts to keep data in local servers prevents tech firms benefiting from economies of scale by housing data in vast hubs across the globe.Christian Borggreen, a researcher at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the Geneva-based lobby group for Facebook, Netflix, BT, Amazon, eBay and others, says: “Forced data localisation is on the rise globally. Since the year 2000 the number of national requirements grew from 15 to 84.”That is significant, he says, because there is a risk that countries that demand data localisation “do this for protectionist or censorship reasons”. He is thinking of Russia and China.There is also a potential risk of damage to productivity from throwing sand in the wheels of global tech. The International Monetary Fund said last month that half of the productivity gains in the developing world came from globalisation, and much of that comes from the adoption of western technology.However, Nick Dearden, head of Global Justice Now, says it is essential that developing countries retain their citizens’ data within their borders to avoid the core of their economies being directed from abroad.The idea that they should be passive receivers of western technology, and borrow heavily on international financial markets to pay for it, means they become prey to the whims of foreign businesses, he says.Susan Aaronson, a digital trade expert at George Washington University in Washington DC, says fighting the adoption of international rules to protect local data privacy is the wrong approach. She argues that developing world countries “could say to tech firms ‘you need to pay for our data and you need to be transparent about how you use it’. They haven’t so far. They’ve accepted the Facebook model.” Separately, they could negotiate common rules for e-commerce.Nick Ashton-Hart, a trade expert who used to work at the CCIA, says the report should consider the issue of data separately from e-commerce. Whereas Dearden considers Amazon, eBay, Alibaba and other trading platforms as rent-seeking operators that suck money out of the economy, Ashton-Hart says they should be seen as giving small businesses in developing-world countries access to global markets. Allowing them, along with Facebook, Google and other global operators, to store data where they want to would create huge efficiency savings that could be passed on to local businesses and consumers.If there is a problem taxing or regulating technology transfers, intellectual property or the sale of goods and services across borders, that is an issue of local governance, says Ashton-Hart, who now works for the International Chamber of Commerce, a group that promotes UK exports.Likewise, governments can set the rules for their citizens’ online privacy and do not need to do it by demanding that global firms maintain relatively small local databases. “The bigger issue is that more than 100 countries have no privacy laws at all, according to Unctad, but this isn’t addressed at all,” says Ashton-Hart. “If developing countries want to protect their nationals, that’s where to start, and NGOs should be calling them out for not doing it.”The issue has come into sharp focus with the EU’s plan to impose new data protection rules in Europe that force companies to win the consent of users before storing personal data online, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).It becomes law at the end of this week, and is causing huge anxiety in the tech sector and a backlash from small business that rely on customer databases to generate new business.Dearden says the issue has become pressing since e-commerce leapt to the top of the World Trade Organisation’s agenda last year in Argentina. African countries were particularly alarmed at proposals to establish a level playing field that would force them to allow trade with major foreign businesses.In a statement following the meeting, African countries signed up to a declaration by the Rwandan delegation, which said the planned rules meant small businesses would be “least likely to be able to effectively compete with multinational corporations, who have become global digital leaders, and have decimated smaller companies”.It said these multinationals had “benefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R\u0026ampD subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc”.Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth.“Some on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don’t know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn’t agreed – and that’s because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.”Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China after it decided the deal was too one-sided.Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away – and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon.The tech industry’s appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable and healthcare is a priority. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments.Apple wanted to save lives, he said. A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information.But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don’t just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it – information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country’s healthiest people – or to cancer patients.In the UK, consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google’s parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust.DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company’s business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. The main target is the $3tn (£2.2tn) US market, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights.Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: “Big tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private ‘solutions’ are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.”Dearden adds: “Patented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What’s more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades … This should worry all of us – because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.”Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley’s aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e31b3a863ea725fb52dd591c2eda9328586c319/0_134_4014_2408/master/4014.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e26fa6ee99d447a27380287289663b","title":"cannes 2018 cheering if baffling set of prizes cap a curious year","story":"Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters swiped the Palme d’Or from hotter tips but few could begrudge this masterful veteran of world cinema his time in the sunSo once again, the decisions of the Cannes jury are wildly different from the social-media-fuelled consensus of the Anglophone press, and certainly my own predictions were horribly wrong. It was disappointing that Cate Blanchett’s jury could find nothing for Lee Chang-dong’s brilliant mystery thriller Burning or for the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan and his deeply sympathetic and beautifully filmed homecoming fable The Wild Pear Tree. But there is something very satisfying about the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda getting his Palme d’Or for the rich, and complex family drama Shoplifters.That would not have been my exact choice, but it is still an excellent film. Kore-eda is a film-maker who has been a presence at Cannes for almost 20 years and the intelligence and subtlety of his films have been an important contributor to the Cannes gold standard of world cinema.Shoplifters is about a rascally man and his boy who make a living stealing from supermarkets one winter evening after a hard day’s thieving, they see a homeless little girl and this man resolves to take her home and look after her in the bosom of his extended, and rackety family. Is this a redemption? A right turn on the path to morality? Not exactly. He wants to “steal” this little girl in the way he steals every thing else, and, Fagin-like, train her up in the ways of shoplifting. And his own extended family is not what it seems. Kore-eda delivers an extraordinary, almost M. Night Shyamalan-type surprise twist, but does it so calmly, so matter-of-factly, that the audience is rubbing its eyes, wondering what’s happened. It’s a very complex film – one which pays its audience the compliment of treating them like intelligent people who are prepared to engage intensely with his film. Kore-eda has to be considered a great Japanese master, and spoken of in the same breath as Ozu and (his own personal model) Naruse.Spike Lee’s fierce knockabout satire BlacKkKlansman won the Grand Prix, and this was a period movie based on the true story of the black police officer who masterminded the infiltration of the KKK in Colorado. Of course, Lee reinvents this as a parable of present and future times, a story stuffed with unsubtle – but often very funny and certainly pertinent – premonitions of Donald J Trump. It is an angry film, a strident and passionate film and one that insists that there is no value in talking about the historical past, or in reviving the Blaxploitation tropes of 30 or 40 years ago, if these references are not put to the service of the present – of attacking the current situation, and the dangerous complacency, narcissism and chauvinism of America’s political masters in 2018. Clearly, the passion and anger of BlacKkKlansman spoke to this jury.The Jury Prize surprised and disappointed me a little – especially given the calibre of films which had been overlooked – although Nadine Labaki’s Capharnum had certainly melted critical hearts harder than mine. It is a poignant and emotionally direct story of a boy in present-day Beirut, who runs away from home, fetches up with an illegal Ethiopian immigrant who is then imprisoned, and who then winds up looking after her baby. It is a story with a silly framing device, about this boy launching a lawsuit against his parents from prison, but there is no doubt that it lands an emotional punch in the solar plexus, and it has its own ethical and emotional integrity. UK audiences will have the chance to make up their own minds when it reaches British cinemas, as it surely will.For me, the single biggest hitter on this list is the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, whose Cold War got him the director’s prize – the story of a star-crossed love affair in the gloom and drear of postwar Poland. It is a brilliantly made and passionately acted film.My own choice for Palme d’Or was Alice Rohrwacher’s sublime and beautifully conceived fable in the style of Olmi – Happy As Lazzaro. It didn’t go away empty –handed, sharing a screenwriting prize with Nader Saeivar and Jafar Panahi, co-writers of the Panahi-directed Three Faces.The brilliant Italian actor Marcello Fonte was a highly popular choice for best actor as the nerdy little dog-groomer and mobster coke-dealer in Matteo Garrone’s extravagantly exciting Dogman. Fonte could be the Roberto Benigni of his generation. Samal Yeslyamova, the star of Kazakh director Sergei Dvortsevoy’s Ayka, won the actress — beating out the much-fancied favourite, Joanna Kulig from Cold War — for her performance as the eponymous Ayka, a woman who gives birth in conditions of almost unimaginable squalor and poverty and has to contend with menacing loan-sharks and heartless landlords. It was a much-admired performance which certainly commanded assent among the jury.You would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at Jean-Luc Godard being given the “special” Palme d’Or for his challenging, sulphurous, angry, bewildering, and disorientating essay-film Image Book. The jury’s attempt to timidly offer up a “special” top prize is unconvincing – and one can only imagine the great director’s frosty lack of gratitude or even interest. Perhaps Godard is at once too special or not special enough for the actual Palme d’Or or any prize actually commensurate with his actual worth.

Godard’s film, Blanchett explained, “almost sat apart from the other films, almost outside time and space”, and so could not be considered against them.Spike Lee’s anti-Trump comedy BlacKkKlansman was runner-up, receiving the Grand Prix, with the third prize going to a film by a Lebanese female director, Nadine Labaki, that had been rewarded with an ecstatic ovation towards the end of the 10-day annual festival on the Côte d’Azur. Capernaum, Labaki’s heart-wrenching attack on the needless suffering of children, was the favourite of Oscar-winner Gary Oldman, who told the press he was backing the film as he walked the red carpet last night.Other favourites included Burning, made by Lee Chang-dong, which earned the highest score from critics ever recorded, and one of the earliest films screened at the festival, Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War.The prize ceremony was marked this year not just by the unexpected winner – the story of a family of petty criminals scraping a living in downtown Tokyo – but also by the passionate speech given at the closing ceremony by the actor Asia Argento. Argento named and shamed her alleged persecutor, the disgraced American film producer Harvey Weinstein.Joining jury member Ava DuVernay on the stage at the Lumiere Theatre in the Palais du Festival, Argento said: “In 1997, I was raped by Harvey Weinstein here at Cannes. I was 21 years old. This festival was his hunting ground. I want to make a prediction: Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again.“He will live in disgrace, shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes. And even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women for behaviour that does not belong in this industry. You know who you are. But more importantly, we know who you are. And we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer.”Weinstein denies all the allegations of non-consensual sex that have been made against him.Blanchett said that choosing the winner for the 71st international film festival “was bloody difficult”. She added that her panel of judges had to put their own personal tastes aside at points to come to a joint decision. “We had to try to put our objective hats on,” said the Australian actor at the press conference that followed the announcement last night.Fellow jury member Kristen Stewart, the American actor, said she had enjoyed her experience of sitting on the jury. “It was like the summer camp of my dreams. It was like a consolidated 10-day film school,” she said.Last year the prize went to Ruben Ostlund’s The Square, a satire of the art world that went on to score an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film.Speaking on the red carpet ahead of the screening of his film, Gilliam said he had been working on the Quixote project for 28 years. It stars Jonathan Pryce, who joined Gilliam in Cannes, as the legendary Spanish deluded hero.

Yet Gareth Southgate is not being flippant when he responds to a question about the Champions League final by emphasising how Liverpool will be representing England when they face Real Madrid in Kiev on Saturday. With the World Cup looming large, England’s manager makes no attempt to play down the significance of Liverpool’s progress under Jürgen Klopp.“It is big,” Southgate says. “We want our players in those big matches. The experience for the likes of Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Adam Lallana over the last few months of playing in those matches that matter – and it was the same for the Spurs boys in their games and the Man City boys – you want them in that environment and to experience winning things.”While a knee injury has ruled Oxlade-Chamberlain out of this summer’s tournament and Lallana has had to settle for a place on the standby list after enduring almost an entire season in the treatment room, Alexander-Arnold and Henderson are part of England’s 23-man squad and Southgate makes it clear that his team will benefit from having players taking part in club football’s showpiece occasion.“Then they know what’s needed,” he says. “They know that hurdles can be overcome and they gain belief from those performances. So I think it’s a great thing for English football that Liverpool are representing England in the final. I know that won’t be seen universally by all supporters. But why would we want Real Madrid to win? I can’t see the logic in that.”It can be fashionable to belittle English players but Southgate believes that Liverpool’s success in Europe is something that should make the country feel optimistic about the future. “When I came here to take the under-21s, it was for that purpose,” he says. “I believed young English players could play in that style. What\u0026nbspwas stopping them from being as good as players around the world? We’re seeing that with some of our youngsters playing abroad and Manchester City having a core of four English players most weeks in their team.“Manchester United have an English core. Liverpool have the same. And they’re working with top European coaches. There’s an assumption that European coaches will come here and pick foreign players. But Mauricio Pochettino has gone with an English core. That’s a great message for our players. They’re performing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world and doing really well.”It is worth listening to Southgate. For all his inexperience at the highest level of management, he is an intelligent man who played in one of England’s finest teams and he gave a lot of thought about how to structure his squad announcement. Some of his predecessors preferred to select 30 players before gradually trimming the numbers. Southgate, however, was wary of making his youthful team unnecessarily anxious. Lewis Cook, Tom Heaton, Lallana, Jake Livermore and James\u0026nbspTarkowski have been given time to adjust to being named as standbys.“We could have picked 30 or how we’ve done it,” Southgate says. “My experience of this way was that it’s cleaner. The guys on standby have a clear understanding of their role. They have some time to get over the disappointment but they will play a crucial part in what we’re doing over the next few weeks and there’s always an opportunity they may be with us beyond that, which is what happened with Trevor Sinclair in 2002.” The then West Ham winger played four matches in that year’s World Cup, having initially flown home from Japan after not making the 23, before injuries propelled him into the squad and then the team.“But he made the observation that there’s a difference between a selection and a performance camp and when there’s an uncertainty between – ‘Am I in or am I not in?’ – then it becomes a selection camp and you don’t only have the five that are likely to be out but another five who think it might be them.“Of the group of 28, you could have 10 or more working with uncertainty. You can be less specific on positions and tactical work. Now we know where players are going to be in training sessions. The players can have less tension around what’s coming and can start to bond a bit\u0026nbsptighter.”Southgate has spoken about a tight-knit squad. But while he believes that the camp will not be riddled with cliques, the competition for places up front is fierce. Dele Alli, who has had another fine season, was a substitute in the recent friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy, with Jesse Lingard and Raheem Sterling preferred in the deep-lying attacking roles.Yet Southgate was impressed that Alli responded by scoring twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win against Chelsea a week later and he made the point that Michael Owen and David Beckham were left out of England’s opening game at the 1998 World Cup. Both went on to make an impact at the tournament. “You perform in a World Cup and that announces you to the world,” Southgate says. “That’s the beauty of playing in an England shirt.“Dele is already an outstanding player and he’s going to get better because of his age and desire. We also have some exciting players coming around. It shouldn’t be that anybody is a guaranteed starter. What gets the best out of you? It’s the games you play but it’s also the competition in training.”It is lucky that Southgate has Steve Holland, the former Chelsea coach, as his number two. “Steve Holland is a legend. He’s won the Champions League, the Europa League, the league, the FA Cup,” Southgate says. “I think the bastard’s won the League Cup as well. With his coaching background in developing young players right through to working with some of best managers in the world, he is the most experienced English coach in the country. He will challenge my thinking and speak his mind. We have complete trust in each other. It’s a critical relationship. Terry Venables had that with Don Howe. He would challenge Terry, who would take it on board.”Between them Southgate and Holland already have an idea of their starting XI to face Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June. “But also there is opportunity for people to play into that thinking,” Southgate says. “We know tomorrow what we would select. But that’s always a slightly movable feast. It’s really competitive.” There are reasons to feel positive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/417fa4078e77ca1f7f875728c990aff0dbb7139e/0_0_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3dd176b76b45a07ea568e0acdc501b","title":"manchester united jose mourinho marcus rashford fa cup final","story":"On a sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling Wembley day Manchester United’s sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling season was finally euthanised to a close.It has been a good season in some ways, with obvious progress made in the Premier League. But it passed here without the garnish of a trophy as Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty settled a largely forgettable FA\u0026nbspCup final in Chelsea’s favour.Chelsea have had a mixed season, too. Victory at Wembley was a reflection not of a team finding its gears, but of the fact in Hazard they had the best player on the pitch, enough to make a difference even in just the briefest glimpse.For United this felt like something else, a dose of necessary medicine where the gleam of another trophy might have concealed the symptoms, hid the deeper snags and knots. Either way it seemed a fitting reflection of United’s status right now to end the season watching this sluggish red‑shirted machine spend 90\u0026nbspminutes trying and failing to score\u0026nbspa goal.This remains the single most interesting thing about this powerful, strangely burdened team. From Anfield to St\u0026nbspJames’ Park, from Andalucía to Ashton Gate, United’s season has been a heavy kind of thing,\u0026nbspwith a sense throughout of trapped energy, of cogs that refuse to click, of results wrung out of bloody‑minded will.Look back and this has been the one constant of the post‑Ferguson era. Through five years and three managers successive teams have shared this clogged aspect, lacking in the vital notes of grace and fluency. Against all expectations Manchester\u0026nbspUnited have somehow become the Daleks.Mourinho’s team has now ended the season with seven goals in their\u0026nbsplast eight games, with fewer away goals than Leicester in the league, with a single goal over 180 minutes against\u0026nbspSevilla, with four goals in a game just once since a fine scoring run in the autumn. Albeit, even in those most liberated moments there\u0026nbsphas been a clanking quality, like an android replicant making brief, sullen attempts to dance the Charleston.If any player embodied this struggle at Wembley it was probably the frantic figure of Marcus Rashford, who was never on his heels, who ran constantly, passed accurately but who seemed throughout to be playing through a kind of fog, blunt when he needed to be sharp, a player making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order.With Romelu Lukaku unfit for anything more than the bench this was a wonderful opportunity for Rashford to play as a starting centre-forward in a season-defining game. Not that his year to date had provided much significant preparation.Rashford did get a start as a centre-forward against Brighton just a couple of weeks ago, a game that inspired a pretty wretched piece of public politicking from Mourinho afterwards. “Why always Lukaku? Now you see why,” was the verdict of a man charged with building the confidence, self-esteem and general pastoral wellbeing of one of the brightest young attacking talents in England. Or not, as the case may be.Here Rashford lined up just ahead of Alexis Sánchez here in a vague, ungrooved, energetically incoherent impersonation of a two-man attack. After five minutes and 30 seconds someone in a red shirt finally passed to him. For a while he made runs: curving runs, runs across the back three, runs behind the full-backs. After all it’s good to keep yourself busy. Meanwhile a football match happened 30 yards away.Rashford is still only 20 and in the middle of one of those difficult seasons young players are allowed to have. The wider issue is the sense of a player drifting into a kind of dead zone where he seems unsure not just of his role but of his own basic skills.Mourinho’s keenest fans will be eager to excuse him from any part in this. But something is missing here. Rashford has talent and willing. There has simply been no development, just a sense of irritation that this young player is not a ready-made elite No\u0026nbsp9.Either way Rashford looks more like an over-promoted youth-team player now than when he actually was one. Certainly it is clearer than ever how important Lukaku is to José’s United. Second balls, bouncing off defenders, fighting for scrappy possession: this is the job now.United did surge after half-time, making concerted attempts to force the ball through Chelsea’s lines in a red-shirted bludgeon. With no obvious attacking plan, United went into blitz mode, midfield storming forward, the full‑backs battering in crosses. But they never really threatened to find the right forward\u0026nbspgear.There is nothing wrong with defensive football, which has its own kind of beauty. Mourinho has been the master of victory through constriction, and in the process has provided some of the most memorable and overachieving European teams of the last couple of decades.But the past tense is significant here. Reactive, strangulating football remains his base note, but it is hardly reflected in the wider world where the most successful teams tend to pour their energies and planning into moving forward, concentrating on the weaknesses not the strengths of an opponent.No goals: no trophy. The extent to which Mourinho is willing, never mind able, to regear this United team over the summer will surely be key to the immediate future of both."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb157c5a5dccfd123de2a7e0b4471f7f2f11af4/0_444_3491_2094/master/3491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5135ef847edd6966d5af82b5c7febb3e","title":"beauty tips gentle pink lips for a hint of prettiness","story":"An innocent look for almost anyoneThe fashion, in beauty today, is to concentrate on “self-expression”, or “strength” – trends that make you smile or gasp, or put on some Bowie quite noisily in a lonely room.

But there are times when it is uncannily literal, and one such occasion is when you are teaching your kids to ride.I have three children and, as is the way of these things, have a very clear memory of teaching one of them to ride – I just can’t remember which of the three it was. So, to save an argument later, I’ll plump for the youngest as all the other stories seem to be about the older two anyway.We took Vita to our local park, she’d been wobbling on a balance bike for weeks and it was time for her first proper ride. We walked to the top of a long grassy slope. My wife had the camera. We lined her up. Feet on pedals, hands on bars, bottom on saddle, stabilisers off.“Don’t forget to brake at the bottom,” Juliet said at least four times. I put my hand under Vita’s saddle and started to push her across the grass. Her little legs began to spin. After a few steps I stopped and my wife and I watched her whirr off down the hill and into the distance, blonde hair eddying behind her, shrieks of joy floating over her shoulder. We’d let go… I then spoiled the moment by guffawing, but really I wanted to weep.Learning to ride is one of the great rites of passage – both for parents and children. You are launching them into a sporthobbypastime that will last a lifetime. My 85-year-old mother-in-law rode her bike to school in Somerset as a seven-year-old and almost eight decades later is still riding. As with anything child-related, the expense-to-time ratio can be steep. But don’t scrimp on their first bike. Buy a decent one because it’s the bike they’ll remember forever. I could happily tell you everything about the bike I learned to ride on.Cheap kids’ bikes break quickly, are hard to ride, often don’t work properly and are usually too heavy for scrawny limbs. One man who does not have scrawny limbs is Sir Chris Hoy. At his peak his monumental thighs were 27in in circumference – each. Working with Evans Cycles, the Olympic champion has recently updated his bestselling bike range. It now includes two essential designs – the Bonaly and Meadowmill. They cater for children from age 4 to 16 and offer a selection of bikes to suit multiple ridding terrains. Named after the area of the Pentland Hills where Sir Chris Hoy first rode his mountain bike, the Bonaly is Evans Cycles’ best-selling children’s bike. Building on the success of previous models, the updated range comes in 16, 20, 24 and 26 inch wheel sizes and now offers a completely redesigned lightweight frame and child friendly components.A perfect all-round ride for a young rider gripped by the thrills of fast bikes, the Meadowmill is named after the cyclo-cross circuit where Sir Chris Hoy raced early in his career. Aimed at young riders who are looking to ride on a multitude of terrains the Meadowmill isn’t just a cyclocross bike, with drop down handlebars and lightweight aluminium frame they also make fine road bikes, at home on the bridleways and quiet tracks that make up any young explorer’s ride.Understanding that a child’s bike is a much greater percentage of their weight than an adult’s bike is means that these bikes have lightweight frames that balance strength and comfort. Internal cable routing creates a clean aesthetic and keeps wires away from small hands. A set of updated child-friendly components also help to offer a better experience when learning to ride. A new “Q factor” crankset has been designed to ensure junior riders’ legs are closer together and that pedalling is efficient and smooth. The crankset lengths are size specific to limit any overstretch of legs, and also ensure pedals don’t clip the floor when cornering. Size-specific handlebars are used to suit the different shoulder widths of children, ensuring confident handling. In addition to the new lightweight frame and finishing kit, low-spoke wheels and super light foam padding for saddles all help to reduce weight and improve comfort whilst on the bike.You can’t stop them riding away, but at least you’ll know they’re doing it on a bike you can trust.Aeron LAB is dhb’s top-level cycling collection: for when speed is of the essence. dhb Aeron LAB top £70, wiggleEmail Martin at martin.love@observer or follow him on Twitter @MartinLove166"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffb5bdc20c8faffd14e2b84b49b88022a4423c89/0_476_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4250c04649b4466814c65af28209be2d","title":"inside the cake oscars a delicious world of weirdness spun from sugar","story":"Weeks and sometimes months of painstaking work and planning go into the sculptural marvels at the International Cake ShowCake people look at the world differently from you or me. They see everything in cake. Or on a cake. “It does consume you” says Brisbane cake artist Zoe Byer, “you can’t really turn it off.”It is like going through a portal into another dimension. A delicious world of weirdness, spun from sugar. A place where “everything is cake all the time” says Scottish master baker Paul Bradford, “it doesn’t matter where you go or if you are on holiday. You see a bouquet of flowers and think that would look good on a cake.”Bradford is one of about 400 “cakers” who have converged on Brisbane this weekend for the International Cake Show 2018, also known as the cake Oscars.Cakers at this level are consummate professionals. What was once the domain of grandmothers and great aunts is now serious business, a huge industry. Bradford’s online cake decorating school has 180,000 members from every country on earth. “It is Netflix for cakes”. In the cake world an orchid is not just an orchid. On a cake it can’t be too chunky and it can’t be too thin. “It has to look natural and not too handmade looking,” says the amiable Scot.Above all it has to look good on Instagram. The rise of reality television shows like Cake Wars and The Great Australian Bake Off have seen people rushing back to the kitchen, after the domestic arts skipped a generation or two.“The more technology takes over the more hungry we are to get our hands back into baking” says Karen Portaleo, an American cake artist superstar who is at the show. “It is a very new world that is ever changing. It is also being completely reimagined to levels that have never existed before.”Indeed some of the cakes in competition at the show seem to to be more about engineering than the icing hastily covering the lumpy mistakes of Grandma. Weeks and months of painstaking work and planning have gone into some of the sculptural marvels on display. This, says Byers is “an art form. “it is not ladies making a frilly cake with a flower or a bow on it. It is about how far you can push things.”The cakes have been flown in from all points of the globe, often on their own plane seat. There can’t be much worse for a caker than having your cake go splat on the way to the show, even though there is a cake hospital for such emergencies. There are tiers and tiers on flower strewn wedding cakes, enchanted forests, gardens, animals, gravity defying flying figurines. One, a large chimpanzee in a dress seem to have a motor inside it that turned its head from side to side. On the day before the show opened there was a hushed, tense atmosphere as judges in white coats hunched over the cakes, peering and murmuring over every detail. Winning an international award is priceless if you have a cake business, but while Bradford concedes it can be competitive and “cut throat”, no one has stabbed anyone else with a cake knife so far.He does, however, know a Spanish woman who once smashed her cake on to the floor during a competition because she didn’t think it was perfect.A pastry chef who has been decorating cakes for 40 years, Greg Cleary is one of the judges. “You want visual impact, presentation, balance, proportion, design, covering skills. The covering of the cake has to be beautiful and smooth and neat. You want the execution of skills.” ‘Agrees Bradford. “They don’t want to see someone who has a good technique but just repeats it over the whole cake. You need to incorporate a lot of different techniques without it looking over the top.”But you have to get your fundamentals right first. No amount of artistry with icing will help if your cake crumbles. “You have to get the inside of the cake correct. A lot of people spend more time on the construction of the cake than the decoration.” You can’t just decide to do a 5 tier wedding cake before you have mastered your humble sponge. “You’ve got to start with Victoria sponge then work your way up to chocolate and toffee cake.”When Bradford first announced his vocation it couldn’t have been less cool. “It’s a very sad story. I used to bake with Gran at weekends. When I was at primary school we had the class talk about what you wanted to be when you got older. Everyone wanted to be a astronauts and policemen. I wanted to be a cake maker.”He went on to own five cakes shops in Scotland and bake cakes for the Queen when she was at Balmoral. (Her favourite was a lemon drizzle with white chocolate ganache.) “They were personal cakes not public ones. Some were really funny. When the Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned we thought they can’t afford a boat anymore, so we did the Royal family in a rowing boat with the Queen rowing and the little Corgi’s and Princess Anne with her hair.” Unfortunately the Queen could not be seen to be rowing a boat so he had to put a page boy there instead.When he did a cake for Prince Albert for the tennis open, the butler gave him a tour of the palace. “We were drinking champagne, even the staff were having a little drink.”Footballers are big on cakes. “I have done loads of footballs, football pitches, football shirts.”His last job before he sold his shops was a cake for lavish Indian wedding for 1000 people. “We did an eight foot tree with all these lovely branches and at the end of each branch were apples decorated with sparkles and glitter. Hundreds of apples and over 1000 chocolate leaves.” In the end, cakes are about celebration. About something special that is happening. “Those people that are cake decorators” says Byer, “are people that like to make other people happy. People don’t come to you to ask for a cake for the saddest day of their life, they are for birthdays and weddings. There is an art to making people happy, sharing joy through sugar and fondant. It is good for the soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645971330f70bb364743e4cbefce1a9a23728a23/1185_1199_4502_2701/master/4502.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22d67cb64ae67868b674b0ff79b7fcc","title":"nigel slater easygoing ready when you are salad recipes","story":"Flexible dishes, delicious as soon as they’re prepared, equally good after a restful pauseThe most useful of recipes are those that do not demand our punctuality at the table. They carry with them a sense of ease, allowing them to be eaten at our pace rather than theirs. So you can pounce on them the moment they are made (that spirit of urgency to tuck in), but they are also happy to sit for a little while without losing anything in terms of flavour or, perhaps more essentially, texture.I made two salads this week that fitted neatly around the sort of day we were having, where people came to the table at different times. Early birds got warm chicken fresh from the oven, tossed with a bright and citrussy dressing and fresh herbs the late arrivals got chicken that had time to rest with the shredded ginger, finely chopped chillies, lime and mint. The second salad was more calming: a collection of brassicas with a balm of goat’s curd and shallots, spiked with sweet-sour onions.The chicken salad was eaten outdoors, to be followed by a platter of piled-up vanilla ice cream with halved passion fruit tucked among it – little cups of apricot-coloured juice and black seeds to tip over the vanilla ice. There were sweet biscuits on the table, too, to crush at will and scatter over in a shower of sweet crumbs. A sort of last-minute assembly that can be made as someone decides to come to the table.The roasting juices form part of the dressing, but you could easily use cold chicken left from a Sunday roast, adding a little more dressing as necessary. If you are not eating this immediately, I would be tempted to add the coriander at the last minute.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the thighs into a roasting tin, rub them generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 45 minutes or until the skin is crisp and the thighs’ juices run clear when pierced with a skewer.Peel the ginger and slice into matchsticks. Halve the chillies lengthways, de-seed if you wish, then slice finely. Peel and finely slice the garlic.Take the chicken from the oven, remove from the tin, then leave to rest for 10 minutes before tearing the flesh from the bones in large pieces and dropping them into a mixing bowl. Place the cooking juices in the tin over a moderate heat, add the ginger and garlic and let them colour to a warm, nutty brown. Add the sliced chilli for the last minute or so, then remove all from the heat.Stir the sesame oil into the ginger and chilli dressing, the Thai fish sauce and the rice wine vinegar. Squeeze the limes, stir the juice into the dressing then check the seasoning.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the sesame seeds until golden then add them to the dressing. Roughly tear the mint and coriander leaves and mix them with the chicken, then carefully fold together the chicken and the ginger dressing.If romanesco evades you, use the thin-stalked tenderstem or purple sprouting rather than double up on either of the others. The salad is best with an assortment of textures. As you lightly cook them, try not to overcrowd the pan.For the pickle:white wine vinegar coriander seeds 1 tspblack peppercorns 1 tsplemon juice of halfsalt 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tspred onion 1, medium romanesco 400gcauliflower 400gbroccoli 400golive oil 3 tbspFor the goat’s curd:banana shallot 1tarragon 30g of bushy stemsgoat’s curd 250gPour the vinegar into a pan and place over a moderate heat, then stir in the coriander seeds, peppercorns, lemon juice, salt and sugar. Peel the onion, then slice in half from root to tip. Separate the layers, then put them in a jar. As soon as the vinegar has come to the boil and the salt and sugar have dissolved, pour over the onion and tighten the lid. Set aside for 4 hours, turning the jar upside down from time to time.Bring a pan of water to the boil and salt it. Cut the brassicas into florets, discarding any thick stalks as you go. Cook the florets in the water for 3 or 4 minutes until they are just tender. Drain and refresh in a large bowl of iced water.Transfer the onions and their pickling liquor into a large serving bowl, then stir in the olive oil. Drain the brassicas, then add them to the bowl. Leave to settle for an hour.Peel the shallot, cut it in half from root to tip, then dice very finely and transfer to a small mixing bowl. Remove the tarragon leaves from their stems and roughly chop them, add them to the shallot, season with black pepper and then add the goat’s curd and fold gently together and chill. It can stay in the fridge until you are ready. Put the cauliflower and broccoli into a serving bowl then add the pickled onion rings and the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a988a2a853567baa8ce8bd4b95677ebc0a76b0b6/0_160_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fcd5a9c4db3ddb038297152f0584d6","title":"planning a holiday dont forget your out of office message","story":"Here are some to copy and paste. How about: ‘I’m ON ANNUAL LEAVE. Ever heard of it? Annual Leave Me Alone Thank You Very Much!’The holiday season is encroaching on work life like knotweed, and for those of us sitting in offices, it makes itself known not just in our unwelcome introductions to colleagues’ exposed feet, but in the “out of office autoreplies” that spring unbidden into our inboxes. As a combination of cultural malaises converge – including unstable careers and an inescapable internet – holidays become a sort of mindgame we play with ourselves. Even if we plan to stop working, even if we take ourselves away to a beach or a mountain, the reality is that our emails will almost definitely still arrive. And for all our groaning insistence that we long to go tech-free, in idle moments our thumbs will inevitably slide towards that blinking blue envelope, that possibility of interest. So what was once an automated message alerting strangers that we were unlikely to see their email has become something quite different. Something that says far more. Feel free, as summer approaches, to simply copy and paste the following.I am currently out of the office and will not be checking emails as I will be sleeping. I want to sleep and sleep. I have organised a careful edit of downers and alcohol that should allow me to lie down tonight and not rise for two weeks except once a day for a steak and an apple. By these means I hope to avoid, not only news of the coming apocalypse, but also the incessant noise of opinion, both internal and external. Feel free to text, but I will not read it. No, my phone will be in the hands of Elton, my mother’s aerobics coach, with the strict instruction to wake me only on the occasion of an emergency, which I’ve clarified to mean: death of close family member with nobody else local to organise burial, major plot development in Love Island, or nuclear crisis that can be halted only with a code I don’t realise I contain. So good luck.Thank you for your message.

But this year there is much to enjoy from its interesting list. Here are three to look out forCo-op Irresistible Bio-Bio Valley Malbec, Bio-Bio, Chile 2016 (£6.99, Co-op) The Co-op is known for putting ethical practices rather higher up its list of priorities than other supermarkets. It was instrumental, for example, in creating the Fairtrade brand back in 2004, and it still leads the way in selling products with the now-familiar logo. In wine it’s way ahead: around two-thirds of all Fairtrade wine in the UK is sold through its stores. The quality of the latter is still a little variable: next time the barbecue comes out, I’d steer clear of the so-so South African Fairtrade trio from Arniston Bay and instead choose one of the wines made by Argentinian winemaking co-operative La Riojana, such as the punchy bright-fruited red, Co-op Fairtrade Irresistible Malbec, Famantina Valley 2016 (£7.99). Although, frankly, the “irresistible” South American malbec in the Co-op range to go for is neither Argentinian nor Fairtrade but textured, fragrant and Chilean.Bethany 6 Gen Old Vine Grenache, Barossa, Australia 2015 (£9.99, Co-op) The people behind the Bio-Bio Malbec, Viña Indomita, also provide the Co-op with a rather lovely, and equally good value, white partner from the same, cool southern Chilean region: Indomita Gran Reserva Viognier, Bio-Bio Valley, Chile 2017 (£7.99) is mouthfilling without being overbearing, with the viognier grape variety’s trademark juicy apricot matched with a swish of acidity. Staying in the Southern Hemisphere, Australia is the home of two dry white Co-op favourites of mine on good form in their latest vintage: the subtly creamy, stone-fruity Co-op Irresistible Chardonnay, Western Australia 2017 (£6.99) from the reliable Larry Cherubino and the precise, limey Jim Barry The Lodge Hill Riesling, Clare Valley 2017 (£9.99). For a Down Under red, meanwhile, I was impressed by a new addition from the excellent Barossa producer, Bethany: red berry fruits and savoury spice abound in a classy old-vine Grenache.Nardelli Cuvee Carolina, Tuscany, Italy 2016 (£8.99, Co-op) There is plenty of fun to be had in Europe too, in a wine range that is smaller, but considerably more erse and consistent in quality, than most of its bigger supermarket rivals. In Iberia, I liked the straight-out-of-the-box, new-vintage freshness of the crisp tropical-and-citrus fruit tang of the light in alcohol dry white Escudo Real Vinho Verde, Portugal 2017 (£5.99), while the uncomplicated bramble jam fruitiness of Co-op Spanish Garnacha 2016 (£4.99) is that rarest of things these days: a drinkable sub-£5 red. From Italy, respected winemaker John Matta’s Castello Vicchiomaggio is the source for another bargain: Nardelli Cuvee Carolina, a textured, modern-style Tuscan sangiovese with a stiffening dose of cabernet sauvignon to go with its soft red cherry, while a weekend treat comes in the deep, dark but supple form of Domaine les Grandes Costes, Pic St-Loup, Languedoc, France 2014 (£14.99), with its evocative liquorice, black olive and blackberry flavours.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbca4eb44d53daa51275704820205a652fb74f38/0_1977_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3f203d945756841760f8cbf23c7f45","title":"the dilapidated victorian house thats now indestructible","story":"Rebuilt and filled with reclaimed pieces, this family home in north-west London has been given a new lease of lifeFlora Bathurst is surveying her back garden with dismay: scattered on the lawn are a bright red robot, a Nerf gun, a toy trolley and a large plastic cash register. “I have tried to do my best to keep it under control,” she says. “But there is an inevitability to small people’s stuff.” Bathurst has lived with her husband and two young children in this terraced house in north-west London for just two and a half years, and already she feels the place is “silting up”.To the outsider, Bathurst’s home is an exquisite assemblage of design classics set against a considered selection of reclaimed materials, but at heart – both literally and figuratively – it’s a hard-working family home. Bathurst, who is a director of photography (and Elle Decoration alumnus), worked with the architect Anthi Grapsa to conquer and corral the toys. The solution is twofold: a corridor of cupboards and a handsome utility room. “I had to fight my husband, Andrew, for the utility room,” says Bathurst. “But knowing how much time I would end up in there doing washing. I wanted a proper space for that.”The four-bedroom, mid-Victorian property was in a dilapidated state when Bathurst received the keys. “It was like a dog that had been really badly beaten,” she recalls, “but I wasn’t going to take on anything that couldn’t be completely done over.” At one point, Bathurst was standing in the living room looking at the roof. “Eventually, the roof, the back and the side all had to come off. We were truly left with a shell.” Undaunted, she discovered the power of rolled steel joists and sliding pocket doors and, after 10 months’ planning and a 10-month build, a new floorplan emerged.The typical Victorian structure was reconfigured. Now, on entering the front door, a 2m-wide sliding door takes you into the living space and adjoining office. Along the right-hand side of the living room, the once gloomy corridor and staircase have been boxed in, creating a vast run of built-in storage that conceals “untold amounts of crap”. There’s also a downstairs loo, the walls covered in Fornasetti wallpaper (a perk from her Elle Deco days).Beyond the office space, another sliding door to the left leads to a beautiful utility room clad in reclaimed Welsh slate. Straight ahead is the open-plan kitchen and dining room, which can be shut off from the rest of the house by another pocket door. (“Useful if you’re having a late one with friends.”) On the first floor are three bedrooms, while the Farrow \u0026amp Ball Inchyra blue master bedroom – with an adjoining iroko and marble ensuite bathroom – was built into the eaves.Having reinvented the floorplan and rebuilt the framework of the house, Bathurst drew on the creativity of the wider Bathurst family for the interiors. (Her late mother was an interior designer, her elder sister, Bella, is an author, photographer and furniture maker, and her middle sister, Lucy, creates bespoke textiles.) Her own professional experience also guided the process. As photography director for Elle Deco, she spent her days editing images of exquisite homes. “What looked like me working hard was actually me doing research for my own house,” she says, wryly. “I was endlessly inspired by those houses and able to pinpoint what I liked and what I didn’t like.”Pinterest became a crucial resource for Bathurst, who accumulated hundreds of images, organising them by room. “You’ll notice that you keep referring back to the same one or two images – that becomes your edit,” she says. “Eventually, you’ll find something that is very applicable to yourself.”For Bathurst, specific material combinations began to emerge, such as slate with brass, and iroko with concrete. All along, the brief was to be “bullet proof”. The reclaimed pitch-pine floorboards that run throughout the ground floor have been treated with soap and lye, and coated in an impenetrable layer of matt varnish. Likewise, the reclaimed iroko tops in the kitchen and utility room are indestructible. The laminated birch-ply cupboards in the kitchen are wipe-downable, as is the black walnut dining table, which was made by her sister Bella, “and given about 20 coats of varnish”.The cushion covers that top the benches in the dining area were designed by Flora and her sister Lucy. The pattern represents the contours of the hills in Scotland where the sisters grew up. Since “small people don’t understand the concept of napkins until they are at least past six”, the cushion covers are removable and washable.Layered against this backdrop is Bathurst’s collection of black and white photography, which she has built up over the years. Above the fireplace is an image from Joseph Szabo’s Teenage series – a housewarming present to herself. “I have a Terry O’Neill of Pete and Dud that I’m very fond of, a Todd Hido, a Matt Black… And my mum was very generous and gave me a couple of pictures from the Atlas gallery. She had a pretty good idea about that sort of thing.”As for furniture, the only new items in the house are the beds everything else has been “resurrected”. The circular vintage Saarinen table was a gift from her sisters, while the matching Tulip chair came from her mother. The sheepskin rug in the living room was an eBay find, and both of the sofas are heirlooms that have been reupholstered.“I’m not a fan of the throwaway culture,” says Bathurst. “And I don’t mind if things are a bit baggy around the edges. You buy something, you wear the shit out of it, you patch it up, and wear the shit out of it again.”It’s a no-nonsense maxim that makes living with a combination of design classics and small people possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d57029ae6309f1441a44545d0c25ef186a2e4f/23_254_1970_1182/master/1970.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669a94a01b7f8ebf9b29341d55e24797","title":"lewisham east byelection janet daby to stand for labour","story":"Council’s deputy mayor, who is viewed as a moderate, selected to fight for ultra-safe seat in JuneThe deputy mayor of Lewisham council has been chosen by Labour to fight a byelection in the area in June.Janet Daby, viewed as a moderate in the party, beat two other candidates after a hustings on Saturday to be selected as the candidate for the ultra-safe Labour seat of Lewisham East. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Daby was a “great campaigner” and he looked forward to working with her. The selection followed Heidi Alexander’s decision to stand down from parliament after being confirmed as London’s deputy mayor for transport.Daby, who has been a councillor in the area since 2010, is also director of the Whitefoot and Downham Community Food + Project, which tackles food poverty, and previously worked in social care. She said: “This is my home and I know the issues that matter to people because they are the same issues that matter to me. “We want a good hospital, we want decent affordable housing, we want a good education and fair opportunities for all our kids. We want a transport system that is fit for purpose and we want to live in a safe, welcoming borough where everyone can feel at home. Lewisham East is a seat in south-east London, where areas of affluence sit alongside pockets of social deprivation. The urban centres of Catford, Blackheath, Lee and Grove Park fall within the constituency. It has been held by Labour since 1992 when Bridget Prentice was elected. In the last local elections the wards inside the leafy constituency returned 21 Labour councillors. Membership to the Labour party has shot up in Lewisham from 1,200 after the 2015 general election to just under 1,700.\u0026nbsp“The Lib Dem-Tory coalition tried to close our hospital. I am proud to have been part of the campaign which stopped that, and I’m proud to have campaigned against the punitive Tory cuts that have put all our services under intolerable pressure.“I’m also proud to have campaigned against this government’s appalling immigration policies, which have caused so much heartache to a generation which helped us rebuild our country.”The Lewisham East constituency in south London is a safe Labour seat, with Alexander securing an overwhelming majority of 21,123 in the 2017 general election. Corbyn said: “It’s a great pleasure to welcome Janet Daby as our candidate in Lewisham East. She is a great campaigner and has already been lobbying me about Southeastern’s appalling train services.“She will be a great advocate for the people of Lewisham and I look forward to working with her should she be elected on 14 June .” Paul Scully, Conservative party vice-chairman for London, said: “It’s disappointing to see that Labour have selected someone who for years has failed to deliver for Lewisham. Labour are too ided and too incompetent to deliver the investment Lewisham needs, and it is ordinary working people who would pay the price.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5366f6c5b6c1c8f886e408fc54e80631d58aa384/448_10_3645_2187/master/3645.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01287ff90adfe0ee8deab4fd84a9809b","title":"tories take four point lead over labour in latest survey","story":"Brexit supporters appear more pleased with Theresa May than remainers are with Jeremy CorbynThe Tories have opened up a four-point lead over Labour – the biggest since last year’s general election – as Remain voters appear to be losing faith in the ability of Jeremy Corbyn’s party to handle Brexit.Despite the improvement in the Conservatives’ overall support, the leadership ratings of the two party leaders remain little changed.The polling suggests opinion is shifting in favour of the UK staying in the single market, a position strongly opposed by most Tories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b604443dd948c0fd7953a05efc96f99bc43fa57/174_0_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bf1517031ef2118ebff66ba946f8c6","title":"vote leave scrutiny facebook data football contest brexit","story":"A data-harvesting competition that offered football fans the chance to win £50m is at the centre of new questions about pro-Brexit campaigning before the 2016 EU referendum.Last week the select committee for digital, culture, media and sport released a letter Facebook sent to the Electoral Commission in which it said that two campaigns, Vote Leave and BeLeave, used three sets of data to target audiences, noting that they covered “the exact same\u0026nbspaudiences”.The two campaign groups are under investigation over whether there was collusion and coordination during the referendum campaign, circumventing spending limits. Under British electoral law, it is illegal for campaigns to work together in any way unless they declare their spending jointly, which Vote Leave and BeLeave did not. Both organisations deny any collusion.BeLeave created 16 adverts using targeting criteria from one or more of the three common audiences on 15 June 2016, but did not ultimately run any of the adverts. Vote Leave created 2,189 adverts based on the same common audiences, and ran about half of them.Now it has emerged that a data set referred to by Facebook, called “50million_remains”, is likely to be a competition that Vote Leave ran, in which it offered fans the chance to win £50m if they correctly predicted the outcome of every game in the European Championships that year.On a blog written after the referendum, Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, admitted that the competition to win £50m was a data-harvesting exercise. Talking about the necessity of data in targeting voters, he said: “Data flowed in on the ground and was then analysed by the data science team and integrated with all the other data streaming in. This was the point of our £50m prize for predicting the results of the European football championships, which gathered data from people who usually ignore politics.”The MPs’ committee announced on Friday that it would be reporting Cummings for contempt of parliament for refusing to appear and answer MPs questions.To enter the competition, fans had to input their name, address, email and telephone number, and also how they intended to vote in the referendum. Last year, Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of media, communication and power at King’s College, London, and the author of an upcoming book, Democracy Hacked, told the Observer that he’d tried to find details of the quiz and exactly what information it had gathered but that the site had been taken down and he could find no trace of it on the internet. “I saw an advert for it at the time. And I couldn’t figure out why it was being done or for what purpose and it was only afterwards that I read Dom Cummings’s blog and I realised that actually it was very clever. Data is very difficult to collect in the UK and they were starting with nothing. But working out what to send what message to what audience was absolutely crucial.“What’s clear from the ad is that they had identified a particular group of people who are really hard to reach. Working-class young men who actively ignore and reject politics. It’s hard to get their contact details and hard to get them to turn out to vote but this was central to Project Waterloo – increasing turnout among particular demographics, especially young working-class males by sending them messages that Leave knew would provoke a response.”Adverts for the competition are still online and show two men in hi-viz jackets – “Gary and Kev” – sitting in a pub drinking beer and talking about football. The prize is £50m, one of them says, because “that’s how much Britain gives the EU every day”. Though no one won the £50m prize, Vote Leave said £50,000 was awarded to one entrant.In a letter published on the Electoral Commission’s website about the competition, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: “Vote Leave’s football score predictor competition raised awareness of the UK’s daily budget contributions to the EU. Facebook confirmed to the DCMS committee that BeLeave did not run any adverts using data sets resulting from this competition or from any other Vote Leave data in its digital advertising campaign. Claims to the contrary are completely incorrect and typical of the sloppy journalism and lies being spread by the  and Observer in their attempt to delegitimise and overturn the referendum result.”Darren Grimes of BeLeave did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30a419be9732baa7874f42dc48276cc68d827b17/0_1318_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13e8910d4cab11ce9ebac7b1bfca8f7f","title":"physicist kate shaw even in conservative places you do not have to be in conflict with scientific","story":"The Cern scientist on her dual role in studying quarks and helping to train a new generation of scientists from Palestine to PeruKate Shaw is a physicist based at the University of Sussex, where she studies the data that pours out of the Atlas experiment, one of the huge detectors that forms part of the Large Hadron Collider at Cern, in Geneva. She is also the founder of Physics Without Frontiers, a Unesco-backed organisation that runs lectures, workshops and schools in war-torn nations to help kindle an interest in science and help local recovery.You work on the Atlas experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. What does that involve?I have worked on the experiment for the past 11 years and that brings me into two different areas of fundamental physics. The first is based on the top quark, the heaviest known fundamental particle in the universe. We are colliding beams of protons together and I study the top quarks that are produced in these collision. It is a great way of probing for new physics, which is really what we built our detector for. We are probing to understand complex issues that we still don’t understand.And your second interest?We are colliding protons millions of times a second at the centre of our detector and we need to know exactly the number of proton interactions that are taking place. This figure is known as luminosity. We calibrate it very precisely. We are looking at a scale of energy density of up to 13 billion billion electron volts. That is the collision energy we are getting in Atlas at the moment, conditions that correspond to a time in the early universe just a fraction of a second after the big bang. And when we build bigger colliders and hit things together even harder, we will be able to look back even further in time.It is an astonishing machine. No country has the money or even the expertise to build something this huge on its own. It is a massive advert for international collaboration. The crucial point is that I can use it whether I am in my office in Sussex University or in Palestine. I can do my analysis and research on my laptop as long as I have connections with the internet. Science is a global pursuit now.Did that influence your decision to get involved with Physics Without Frontiers?I founded the programme in 2012. I was working in Palestine – at the Birzeit University, near Ramallah on the West Bank. I gave a talk on the Large Hadron Collider and people suggested I come back. So a year later I came back with two Palestinian colleagues who were also working on the Atlas experiment and we started training students. It really grew because the quality of students is very high but they only have a master’s programme, not a PhD programme.From that beginning we started running courses. We go once or twice a year and run schools, workshops and training. Already in Palestine we have PhD students working back there and with other countries. It is all about building capacity in the country, about giving people access to science.You do not know who is going to be the next great person, the next Abdus Salam or Alan Turing. So it is our job as scientists to make sure that everyone has access to education and to be able to get involved in research no matter what country you are from. It cannot really be the luxury by the western, richer countries.How do you raise your funding?It is funded by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, which is based in Trieste and was founded by the Nobel physics laureate Abdus Salam. It in turn is funded by three groups: Unesco, the Italian government and the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are a Unesco institute.And how do you ide your work and what other countries are you now involved with?It is about 50-50: half to Sussex on Cern stuff and the other half is with Physics Without Frontiers, which now has numerous outlets. Nepal, Afghanistan, and Palestine are my particular babies, as it were. But we also work in Latin America in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay and we also go to Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.Do some authorities make things hard for you in places such as Palestine?Yes. It can get complicated – in Palestine in particular. With the West Bank there are fewer problems but in Gaza the political situation is disastrous. It has been under siege since 2005. They have three universities which are all doing some great physics. But the faculties there are completely isolated. They cannot leave or travel and the students we get really struggle. Sometimes they miss opportunities because they cannot get out. It is very frustrating.How does Palestine compare with other areas you are now working in?One of our more recent focuses for attention is Afghanistan, which suffers from huge issues of security. But it also has an amazing young generation there who seem to have a lot of hope that they can make the country what they know that it can be. We worked with very young faculty members in the physics department. They were extremely strong in their subject, really passionate about starting physics there and getting international collaboration at Kabul University. We held a workshop and something like 300 participants turned up. It was fantastic.It is a very secular activity you are involved in. Do some countries object to your godlessness?I always tread a little carefully in the beginning but actually in places where you might find the most conservative people are living, they ask exactly the same sorts of questions about the big bang and the origins of the universe that you would get in any other country. It is very reassuring. Even in these places you do not have to be in conflict with basic scientific ideas. They can be accepted. They also recognise that having good PhD students in physics in the country is good for the economy.At the moment we are just kicking off. We have been going for six years. It is only in the last couple of years that we have been really growing. In the end we hope that every university is connected with this programme and then that brings some more funding for physics there. Our aim is to create vibrant scientific communities across the world.• While students in Gaza may apply for, and be offered opportunities on, courses in other parts of Palestine or other countries, they encounter a great number of regulatory hurdles before they can take them up. It is common for students to offered a number of places but be unable to transfer due to the refusal of the authorities to issue the relevant permits.• Gaza students are often refused permits to attend scientific conferences in other parts of Palestine. Last July, four students were forced to participate remotely in the second Palestinian Advanced Physics School at Birzeit University because they were denied travel permits.• On a practical basis, operating a science lab in Gaza is extremely challenging. The electricity supply to the strip is erratic and can last between four and eight hours a day, making it difficult to use electronic instruments and perform experiments.• Border regulations mean that many of the materials required for science, particularly chemicals, are impossible for Gaza scientists to obtain. “The infrastructure of the laboratories is very bad because Israel considers that everything is dangerous to their security,” says Dr Rami Morjan of the Islamic University.• Equipment is also hard to fund and import. Potential overseas funding partners are nervous about buying equipment for Gaza institutions because they know from experience that it may be destroyed in a bombing raid. The result is that students often have to carry out research experiments remotely, using equipment at other institutions.• Gaza-based scientists who win grants for their research often end up losing the funding because they are unable to secure the equipment and materials needed to carry out their research because of the challenges outlined above.Source: Scientists for Palestine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7caa669da85cdc89b63e02092303b2e223ba09b/0_95_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14541ca1e484ed2d02fa496017265909","title":"shigur idol shatters expert views birth of ritual art hunter gatherers","story":"Studies date Shigir Idol to 11,500 years ago – and cast new light on hunter-gatherers at the end of the ice ageOn 24 January 1894, gold prospectors were digging in the Shigir peat bog, north of the town of Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, when they uncovered a strange collection of carved pieces of wood.A total of 10 fragments were found beside each other. When put together, a wooden idol more than five metres high was created, one that had clearly been carved from a single, carefully smoothed plank of larch wood. Its surface was covered with zigzag lines and human faces and hands.This is the Shigir Idol, and according to scientists writing in Antiquity, recent studies of its structure and its date of construction dramatically overturn our ideas about the appearance of art among humans. The idol, it transpires, is one of the oldest pieces of monumental art ever uncovered.“Our analysis indicates that the Shigir Idol is around 11,500 years old,” said archaeologist Professor Thomas Terberger, of Göttingen University, in Germany, one of the authors of the Antiquity paper. “At that time, Europe and Asia were still emerging from the ice age. There were no farmers then. The only humans in this part of the world at this time were hunter-gatherers. Yet they created the Shigir Idol. The discovery of its antiquity therefore changes, dramatically, – our views about the birth of ritual art.”Many examples of early stone age are known: they include the cave paintings of France and Spain, created more than 30,000 years ago, and tiny objects, carved out of mammoth tusks, that depict animals or animal-human hybrids. Many of these are extremely delicate and extraordinarily well crafted. But they are generally realistic in style. The symbol-covered Shigir Idol represents a leap beyond this sort of naturalistic art.When the idol was discovered, the date of its construction was a matter of conjecture and remained so for a century until, in the 1990s, scientists removed a portion and used radiocarbon detectors to date it. It produced an age of about 9,800 years. any scholars rejected the result as implausible. Hunter-gatherers did not have the ability to make such a huge work or have the complex symbolic imagination to decorate it in the way that the idol has been adorned, sceptics argued.As a result, a new, more sophisticated dating was sought and the result of that work is outlined in Antiquity. These show that far from being a younger object than was suspected by the sceptics, the idol turns out to be even older than was indicated by the first dating attempt. “The result was quite a surprise, I admit,” said Terberger.In the past, large-scale complex art was considered to be the handiwork of later, sedentary farming people who started to spread from the Middle East about 8,000 years ago and took over land previously used by hunter-gatherers. These agrarian societies achieved considerable sophistication and were eventually responsible, in Britain, for the construction of great Neolithic works such as Stonehenge and the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney.By contrast, it was assumed hunter-gatherers were not capable of the type of symbolic thinking, nor the organisation, that underpinned the design of these great monuments. However, the dating of the Shigir Idol suggests this is not the case and that the period just after the last ice age was not a cultural desert as some experts have argued. The lack of remains of hunter-gatherer monumental art may simply be blamed on the fact that they used wood which has not survived – unlike the stone works of their farming folk successors. Only the freak conditions of the peat bog of Yekaterinburg permitted the idol’s survival.“We have to accept that hunter-gatherers had complex rituals and were capable of very sophisticated expression of ideas and art,” said Terberger. “These things didn’t start with farmers, they began with hunter-gatherers much earlier.”Analysis of wood from the idol has also revealed much about living conditions. “If you study the rings, you can see trees were growing very slowly as it was still pretty cold then. Europe was still emerging from the last ice age. You can see that in the rings of the wood that makes up the idol.”Over the years, archaeologists have dug up many small tools also decorated with zig-zag symbols in northern Europe, suggesting that society was much less fragmented than previously thought and that there was considerable sharing of ideas. Terberger said: “It is exciting to see these connections being established over huge distances.”But what was the purpose of a monument that would have loomed over any terrain in which it was erected? “From our current perspective, it is very hard to work out what was going on in the minds of the creators of the Shigir Idol,” Terberger said. “However, I am struck by the similarity of the idol with the totem poles of native Americans in the north-west Pacific region.” Such poles often honour gods or ancestors and this could explain the purpose of the idol.Other researchers suggest alternative theories. Mikhail Zhilin of the Russian Academy of Sciences – another of the paper’s authors – argues that the idol might depict forest sprites or demons while Vang Petersen, of the National Museum of Denmark, suggests that the carvings were “keep out” warnings not to stray on sacred land. “It’s intriguing,” Terberger says. “What is certain is that its makers were saying a lot more than just an announcement that ‘I can build a big pole.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c6cb871d109b6ab0043b8bde3d9ab125041a5ea/0_260_3976_2386/master/3976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d545cdc7875415063799b303087b1e","title":"aidan obrien ryan moore lockinge newbury rhododendron horse racing","story":"As Rhododendron stood in the winner’s enclosure, her flanks heaving after battling to a short-head success in the Lockinge, Aidan O’Brien reflected on how her career nearly came to a sanguinary end at Chantilly last summer.“It was the most unbelievable thing of all,” the trainer said as he recalled the sheer quantity of blood that came out of her nose mid‑race and caused Ryan Moore to pull her up.“She bled the worst you’ve ever seen. I’ve never ever seen anything to bleed as bad. She exploded and she sprayed blood over all the jockeys and all the horses, it was the most incredible thing.”O’Brien added he had no doubt at the time that Rhododendron’s career was finished, which is hardly surprising, since he makes the incident sound like the last reel of a horror movie. “She got very faint in herself. It was very rare that you’d see a horse ever come back from that. But they took great care of her in France.”Rhododendron recovered to have a much better experience of French racing when she bagged a valuable prize in the autumn but her performance here counts as a career best. Having only won races confined to females, she beat 13 male rivals here and had all but one of them comfortably held at the line.The exception was Lightning Spear, who emerged from the pack to challenge the filly, the pair of them engaging in a back-and-forth tussle through the final 300 yards. It looked very much as though Lightning Spear was going past as he reached the line but he needed the post to be another five yards down the track.It was a familiar outcome for those who have backed Lightning Spear in top-class races, this being his 14th attempt in a Group One and the closest he has come to winning one. David Simcock, who has trained him for the last couple of years, was in visible agony over the\u0026nbspoutcome.Where is the Group One that this horse can win, he was asked by a journalist with an apparent cruel streak. “If somebody could tell me, I’d be so happy,” Simcock replied.Addeybb and Limato were disappointing in eighth and 10th places and there is a distinct possibility that both were disadvantaged by racing on the stands side, while most straight‑course races at this two‑day fixture suggested the centre of the course was the place to be. But Addeybb’s connections blamed the ground and will look for days when firm does not feature in the going\u0026nbspdescription.O’Brien, meanwhile, said he had walked the track and felt the best of the ground was on the stands side, leaving him doubting the chance of Rhododendron from stall two. She is now likely to go for the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot, for which bookmakers have her as favourite at a top price\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp5-1.Newbury officials were feeling under pressure through the afternoon, lest there should be a repeat of the fighting that so marred fixtures at Goodwood and Ascot on the previous two Saturdays, but, 30 minutes after racing had finished, no such incidents had been reported by the many visible security staff around the site. Police were also\u0026nbsppresent inside the grounds, which had not been true at Ascot or Goodwood.It may have helped that the crowd, at just over 10,000, was slightly down compared with previous years, the result of a clash with the royal wedding, which was shown on big screens, and the FA\u0026nbspCup final, which was not. The course was also trialling a new rule that no one could be served more than four pints at any bar at any one time.The sport’s rulers have their fingers crossed for similarly uneventful Saturdays to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/319650fc441e8d251edbae0b54376f7abc084672/0_64_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63690616e53daab076fc392a319d454b","title":"cavaliers celtics score nba playoffs lebron","story":"LeBron James had 27 points and 12 assists, Kevin Love added 14 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers looked like a different team on their home floor, tightening the Eastern Conference finals with a 116-86 victory in Game 3 over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night.Outplayed during two losses in Boston, the Cavs used a three-day break in the series to regroup and re-grip this series. They built a 19-point lead in the first quarter, pushed it to 30 in the second half and overpowered the Celtics, who fell to 1-5 on the road in the postseason.Any discussion of Cleveland’s demise is premature. Kyle Korver made four of the Cavs’ 17 3-pointers and Cleveland had six players in double figures.Game 4 is Monday night before the series returns to Boston.Jaylen Brown was in foul trouble all night and scored just 10 for the Celtics after averaging 23 in the first two games. Jayson Tatum scored 18 and Terry Rozier 13 for Boston.Only 19 of a possible 300 teams have ever overcome a 2-0 deficit in the playoffs. James and the Cavs, who previously did it in 2007 and again in 2016 while winning the NBA title, took the first step toward a third comeback.To return to the NBA finals for the fourth straight year, the Cavs have to win four of five and re-write Boston’s illustrious history. The Celtics are 37-0 when they win the first two games in a series.“That doesn’t bother me,” Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said before Game 3. “The games have to be played. They won two games on their home court, which we know they’ve been playing well the whole playoffs, but we’re not discouraged.Apparently not. The Cavs came in wanting to play faster and be more physical with the younger Celtics, who were the aggressors in Games 1 and 2.Lue also needed more from point guard George Hill after two poor performances (8 points, 1 assist) in Boston. Hill responded with a driving layup to start the game and drained three 3-pointers in the first quarter as Cleveland wasted no time taking control.Hill finished with 13, J.R. Smith 11 and Cleveland’s supporting cast played so well that James only had to play 37 minutes.Boston coach Brad Stevens was confident his team would play better on the road than earlier in these playoffs, but the Celtics were shaky early, committing four turnovers and shooting 2 of 10 while the Cavs opened a 27-11 lead.James arrived at 5.45pm, greeted by the usual phalanx of cameras waiting to record his walk from the security entrance at Quicken Loans Arena to Cleveland’s locker room.Earlier in the day, James said the fact he has twice rallied from 2-0 deficits in the postseason offered no relief.“There’s nothing about the playoffs that’s comfortable until you either win it all or you lose and go into the summer,” he said.Summer might not be as close as it once seemed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790600aa03c9dbb977fd12c8900e1713f2848bec/0_0_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d43056f1fa2192b08f4e465f10c397","title":"chris froome giro ditalia simon yates","story":"On the top of what is billed as the hardest climb in World Tour cycling, the Giro d’Italia entered its final week with the standings finely poised after a dramatic comeback from Chris Froome put the quadruple Tour de France winner back in the frame.Simon Yates successfully held the pink jersey, gradually opening a gap on the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, but his advantage does not look decisive. Not yet.For the first time since the race left Jerusalem 15 days ago, Froome resembled the rider who has won the Tour de France four times in five years, although any result he gains in the Giro remains subject to the verdict on his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol. He made his move four kilometres from the finish, which was perched on a dizzyingly high mountain in north-east Italy, and forged ahead in his familiar style, part cyclist, part praying mantis trying to work out which leg ought to go where.Froome is never pretty to watch but he has broken plenty of hearts. Yates was not among them here he could be content, if not euphoric, after escaping the other overall contenders a kilometre after Froome had broken\u0026nbspclear.Theirs was a classic pursuit match – old Briton versus new kid on the block – with the outcome in the balance until Froome turned the final right-hand bend and faced the last 100m to the finish line up a final painfully steep slope.Behind Yates came two noted mountain men, the diminutive Domenico Pozzovivo and the grizzled Frenchman Thibaut Pinot, but if there was a surprise at the top of the monstrous 10km ascent through 100,000 baying Italian cycling fans, it was Dumoulin. His substantial Dutch frame does him no favours on a mountain this steep but he rode the perfect race for a time trial specialist. His mission was to limit his losses and he never faltered as he held Yates\u0026nbspto 31sec, where more highly rated climbers – most notably the Italian champion, Fabio Aru – ceded time.“It’s a nice gain for us,” said Yates’s team manager, Matt White, who expects his young Briton to go on the attack again on Sunday’s stage, which has a difficult finish with repeated climbs leading to the ski resort of Sappada, where a steep little ramp will favour Yates’s explosive finish. There the standings are likely to be reshuffled againYates had led the race since Mount Etna, a couple of days after the Giro’s return to Italian soil following the start in Israel. The 25-year-old from Bury had followed his electrifying attack up Etna with an assured eight days in the pink leader’s jersey, in which he had won two stages including the mountain-top finish in the Abruzzo at Gran Sasso last Sunday. This was a challenge of a different order, however.Nicknamed The Kaiser because of its proximity to the Austrian border, the climb becomes so narrow that the race organisers allowed none of the usual\u0026nbspservice and organisation vehicles to tackle the ascent for fear they might stall on a bend and block the\u0026nbsproad.Motorbikes were provided instead. There are often restrictions on the vehicles permitted to tackle the steepest climbs, but this is unprecedented. The tifosi crammed into a natural amphitheatre on the mountainside to watch the field come past at a snail’s pace, around a series of painful hairpins.For Froome, this was a welcome comeback. His Giro had stalled before it even began, with a crash as he reconnoitred the prologue time trial\u0026nbspin Jerusalem, and it had got worse with each day, with another fall – uphill, on wet roads – on stage eight before he had subsided in the final 2km at Gran Sasso.He had looked out of the picture going into the Zoncolan stage, 3min 20sec behind, but his deficit on Yates narrowed slightly and he moved within reach of the riders fighting for podium places behind the Mitchelton-Scott leader: Dumoulin, Pozzovivo and Pinot. For a man who had been written off in the last week – only seven journalists attended his rest-day press conference – it was sweet revenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cde1e34c7082cb254ac4179a76708c86b7514af/0_162_2577_1547/master/2577.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b42c18460a62ea54f07e40e8f98ebbb","title":"england denny solomona bans south africa","story":"Denny Solomona’s rugby union career is only 18 months old but it has, to put it mildly, been eventful. He has scored 21 tries in 28 Premiership matches for Sale after terminating his contract with rugby league’s Castleford, which cost the Sharks a reported £300,000 in compensation and legal fees, marked his debut for England in Argentina last year with the winning try in the first Test, was sent home from a national training camp two months later in disgrace after a late‑night drinking session with Manu Tuilagi and missed the final month of this season while he served a ban for allegedly making a homophobic remark to the Worcester fly-half Jamie Shillcock.The 24-year-old wing, who was capped by Samoa in rugby league, has been in Brighton with England this past week, preparing for next Sunday’s friendly against the Barbarians at Twickenham before the three-Test tour to South Africa.“I want to put the ban behind me and focus on England,” he says. “I was with the squad throughout the Six Nations so I have been in the mix and I used my time off to prepare myself for the next few weeks.”After making two appearances from the bench in Argentina, Solomona was part of this year’s Six Nations squad without making a match-day 23 but with Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell not touring next month because of injury, he is in contention for a starting berth.“The door is open for me and it is exciting,” says Solomona. “We focused on unity in Brighton, being together as a team.“We took that for granted and let it slide a tiny bit but we all mixed together: when you go for a coffee, it is not just with the people you usually hang around with but players from different clubs to make sure you are all on the same page. If you are tight off the field it brings you together on it. Everyone is mixing and putting their best foot forward. We played mini golf one\u0026nbspmorning.”When Solomona was charged with allegedly aiming homophobic abuse at Shillcock in March, he faced a suspension that would have ruled him out of the South Africa tour. With nothing picked up on the referee’s microphone, Sale did not appeal against the four-week suspension handed out by a disciplinary panel, not least because of the potential for a longer ban, but they maintained his\u0026nbspinnocence.“It was one person’s word against mine,” says Solomona. “I’ve served my four weeks, that’s it. I was hoping that my performances throughout the season would have been enough to get me back into the England camp and I am happy to get the opportunity.”Eddie Jones wasted no time in selecting the New Zealand-born Solomona once he had qualified for England on residency last summer, before the pending rule change that will extend the period from three to five years. “I’m Samoan and when I played for them in rugby league, I felt it was necessary to represent my\u0026nbspgrandparents and my heritage,” says the wing. “Now I am focusing on England and I love it. I have bought a house here, I am married to an English woman and I\u0026nbspam setting roots.“I have not found the transition from league bad because when I was in Auckland I played union on a Saturday and league the next day\u0026nbsp– I think my parents wanted to get me out of the house as much as I\u0026nbspcould. The England coaches text me regularly and Sale is a club which is all about everyone helping each other out. I am just soaking up all the knowledge.”Solomona is likely to be facing one of his Sale team-mates in South Africa, the scrum-half Faf de Klerk, as the new Springboks’ regime under Rassie Erasmus looks to overturn two poor years by lifting sanctions on players based overseas who have not won at least 30 caps. De Klerk has made a profound difference to Sale in the last two seasons and his position is one where reinforcements are needed.“Faf brings a lot of energy,” said Solomona. “I don’t think I have known him to be quiet for one minute. If he is called up by South Africa, he deserves it. It will be my first time in the country and I just want to get my hands on the ball and start doing what I need to under Eddie. People have talked about the different conditions there, but that doesn’t matter. We’re not bothered if the ground is hard or wet, we just get on with it.”Jones will be using a humidifier in England’s indoor training facility\u0026nbspbefore the squad leave for South Africa to prepare the players not so much for next month as next year’s World Cup in Japan when conditions may be hot and humid. The temperature will be 30C, but it will not come as a shock to\u0026nbspSolomona.“I know what is coming because I was with Melbourne Storm when they used one. It was fine. The concept is to break the mould, to make you feel uncomfortable because you never know what will happen on a rugby pitch.“You have to expect everything. Eddie has been focusing on the little details we need to get right. It’s been pretty good I don’t know if he has been too kind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fe739881cec682cdcf5d44d35e729ec5a96611/103_104_4721_2832/master/4721.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e37714416ec270b8faf12c6d92e1a604","title":"mark wood england pakistan test","story":"The Lord’s pitch will dictate who is chosen for England’s final bowling spot against Pakistan this week, but the Durham right-armer is willing to adaptMark Wood feels ready to crank up the pace at Lord’s this coming week should the instruction come from Joe Root. But the long-term aim is still to become a bowler for all seasons and one who lives up to some as yet unfulfilled hype in Test cricket.Unless an emerald green pitch is rolled out at Lord’s when England take on Pakistan from Thursday, and makes the uncapped spin of Dom Bess as redundant as an Argos catalogue in Ikea, then the chief talking point will be whether it is Wood or Chris Woakes – who took 11 wickets in the same fixture two years ago – who gets the final spot. Though Wood is the incumbent, having replaced Woakes for the final Test of the winter in Christchurch, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will still take a view based on the surface. Grassy, and the Warwickshire bowler could win his spot back dry with potential for reverse later on, and it is over to Durham’s fast but slightly fragile right-armer.Asked during the launch of the new England kits where his pace is currently, Wood replies: “That’s a question for the speed gun. There’s times I can bowl quickly and times I know I can but don’t like to force it because I’ll leak runs. It depends what the captain wants – if he wants me to rev it up then I’m happy to do that.“I want to be a bowler for all conditions. But I’d certainly be happy if they said Woakes, Jake Ball or whoever is more suited to a pitch – I wouldn’t have a problem. More than anything I want the team to do well. Hopefully I can bring something else when conditions aren’t like that, where it’s drier, reverses or a slower pitch.”Such skills came to the fore during Wood’s first county match of the season when, having called time early on a bench-warming spell in the Indian Premier League with Chennai Super Kings, he used similar conditions to claim a career-best six for 46 in Durham’s run-soaked draw at Derbyshire, which finished on Monday. His dismissal of Wayne Madsen, caught behind failing to evade a searing short ball from around the wicket, was his personal favourite and demonstrated why England have persisted for three years.With 28 wickets at 41 from 11 Tests, the 28-year-old accepts that while injuries are a factor, the Test-watching public are yet to see his best. “I need to get more wickets, I need to be more consistent,” says Wood. “To be honest I’ve got a lot to prove to the selectors, coaches, media, the fans because I’m a guy people probably had high hopes for and I’ve not done it consistently enough. An average of 40 is pretty average to be honest and I definitely want to lower that.“I’ve got a point to prove to myself that I am good enough to do it at that level. Am I really as good as I think I am? Am I as good as the commentators, selectors think I am? Can I live up to that? I’ve got a long way to go.”Such honesty is one of Wood’s endearing qualities, as is the drive to succeed at Test level in an era when, as a fast bowler with a back story of injuries and operations, he could easily jump on the Twenty20 train as a white-ball specialist.The reason why not? “When I was in the back garden as a kid it was never T20 or 50-over, it was Test matches. In my mind all the best players were at Test level and that’s what I wanted to strive to. These days, the 50- and 20-over stuff is a huge part of the game so I’m delighted to be part of such a good team.“But the pinnacle for me is still trying to get into that Test side and I think I have a real point to prove.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375fad43d66220f988fc0eca062b41796dcfe68e/0_140_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a2d8753af75aa5f0c9edae82384ad8","title":"saracens wasps premiership play off semi final match report","story":"• Saracens 57-33 Wasps• Farrell kicks 27 points to back up Saracens’ try spreeNormal service has been resumed.

None was more masterful than Owen Farrell, who kicked 11 from 11 for a haul of 27 points, a record for a play-off. It was good news all round for Eddie Jones.Saracens’ England contingent all looked a million dollars. On this form, England have every chance of turning round their own season too. Billy Vunipola looked punchy, but he was taken off at half-time, having received treatment on the half-hour.Wasps, meanwhile, lost Jack Willis with a nasty-looking knee injury, which may cost him his place on England’s tour of South Africa.Saracens have made it their business of late to put sides away in the second half, winning their past four matches by an average of 54-11. Their form might have been explained away by the procession of opposition they have faced with little or nothing to play for, but here was confirmation it had not been flattering.They did not wait until the second half to cut loose this time. They did not even wait till the end of the second minute. Farrell scythed between Joe Launchbury and Jake Cooper-Woolley after barely 90 seconds and found on his shoulder Alex Lozowski, who had run a brilliant supporting line, for the first try.Wasps were all over the place around the fringes, and the Saracens runners, from sufficiently various angles to confound a far meaner defence, poured through. Questions have been asked of the wisdom of Mako Vunipola’s touring with England, but he looked unstoppable with ball in hand. That said, Richard Wigglesworth could take his pick of the forwards presenting themselves at pace.Ten minutes later he chose Maro Itoje, another England player back in the swing, to crash through and Vincent Koch followed up for the try. Wasps thought they had replied almost immediately, Elliot Daly and Jimmy Gopperth combining spectacularly, but the latter’s arm was touch-in-goal before the ball was down.Saracens kept coming, but they would not score another try until the start of the second half. Three penalties did accrue from the boot of Farrell, one from a scrum, another area of dominance. It was Wasps, rather, who scored the second quarter’s only try, Christian Wade and Juan de Jongh sending Willie le Roux over.The game seemed over, though, two minutes into the second half, when Brad Barritt’s quick hands and Alex Goode’s draw-and-give put Chris Wyles over for a 30-5 lead. Surely curtains. Wasps had other ideas.Daly was unlucky to be denied a try by the TMO a couple of minutes later, but Wasps had their second when Cooper-Woolley barged through Nick Isiekwe from an attacking lineout, before Wasps hit their highest note yet. Wade took an inside pass to cut Saracens to shreds and turn the ball inside for Thomas Young to gallop 35 metres to the line. Wasps were back to within 11 with half an hour to play.It was then 10 with 20 to go. Farrell steadied Saracens with a couple of penalties, but Wasps struck again on the hour. Danny Cipriani sent Guy Thompson through a gap and the latter sent Le Roux to the tryline for his second and a 36-26 scoreline.It was as close as Wasps would get. Saracens seemed exasperated by the way the visitors were now cutting them up, but they never seemed in trouble. They duly killed the game off with two tries in the next 10 minutes, Juan Figallo from short range after Shalk Brits had cut Wasps down the left, then Sean Maitland the right, and Itoje, who galloped home from rather further out.The carnival feel continued with another try apiece, one for the electric Wade, one for Ben Spencer, but Saracens’ minds had already, no doubt, turned to Twickenham.Eddie Jones would have enjoyed watching Saracens, such was the form of several of his key players in their 57-33 play-off win over Wasps, but it seems likely he will be denied the services of one of his most promising youngsters, Jack Willis, for England’s tour to South Africa next month. The Wasps flanker was helped from the field towards the end of the first half, having hyperextended his knee. The initial prognosis is not positive.“It’s not looking great,” said Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby. “He’s in a brace and on crutches and they think it’s serious enough for him to have a scan straightaway.”Jones will also monitor closely Billy Vunipola’s status. He started the game, like his fellow England No 8 Nathan Hughes, the latter more surprisingly selected for his first Premiership start since October, but Vunipola left the field at half-time, having received treatment on the half‑hour.“He felt a little tightness in his hamstring,” said Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. “He fought with us a bit to go back on for the second half, but it didn’t seem worth the risk, with half an eye on next weekend. He’s got a chance to be fit. He probably won’t train on Monday or Tuesday, but he played pretty well for 40 minutes for someone who hasn’t played very much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe01522be353aa84561e96379ae9715b03fc71c/0_62_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263530ced2b5743550079a46cde3951f","title":"uk government plans new laws tackle internet wild west","story":"New laws will make Britain ‘safest place in the world’ to be online, culture secretary saysNew laws will be introduced to tackle the internet’s “wild west” that will make Britain the “safest place in the world” to be online, the culture secretary has said.Social media companies have already taken some positive steps to protect users, but the performance of the industry overall has been mixed, according to Matt Hancock.The government outlined proposals last year to impose an industry-wide levy on social media firms like Facebook and Twitter to fund measures to tackle online harm. It is understood the move will be subject to a further round of consultation with the sector and charities before any decision is made on pushing ahead.A new code of practice to tackle bullying, intimidating or humiliating online content and a regular internet safety transparency report to keep tabs on online abuse could be included in new legislation.Hancock said: “Digital technology is overwhelmingly a force for good across the world and we must always champion innovation and change for the better. At the same time, I have been clear that we have to address the ‘wild west’ elements of the internet through legislation in a way that supports innovation. “We strongly support technology companies to start up and grow, and we want to work with them to keep our citizens safe. People increasingly live their lives through online platforms, so it’s more important than ever that people are safe and parents can have confidence they can keep their children from harm.“The measures we’re taking forward today will help make sure children are protected online and balance the need for safety with the great freedoms the internet brings, just as we have to strike this balance offline.”The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office are jointly working on a white paper that is expected to be published in the autumn.The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Criminals are using the internet to further their exploitation and abuse of children while terrorists are abusing these platforms to recruit people and incite atrocities. We need to protect our communities from these heinous crimes and vile propaganda, and that is why this government has been taking the lead on this issue.“But more needs to be done, and this is why we will continue to work with the companies and the public to do everything we can to stop the misuse of these platforms. Only by working together can we defeat those who seek to do us harm.”Alex Holmes, deputy chief executive at young people’s charity the Diana Award, said: “We look forward to seeing government, industry, businesses, schools and the wider children and charity sector workforce continue to work together to make the internet a safer place for all.”“We urge government in the white paper to consider legislation that ends the era of technology self-regulation and puts children’s safety at the heart of the online world. Taking action now is vital to protect the next generation of children.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358ae420467fd99eafb5fd11a5eb8b72478347cf/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d03c8f056baf30df3af6e539da08478","title":"evangelicals israel usa end times","story":"For many on the Christian right, the state of Israel has been seen as a key to fulfilling prophesy. A new generation has other ideasThis week, the Trump administration completed its move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.At the opening ceremony, two of the American speakers were evangelical superstars: Pastor Robert Jeffress, the author of several doomsday books about Israel, and John Hagee, who interpreted recent lunar eclipses as evidence that the end times were nigh. The Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, meanwhile, declared that Trump had “fulfilled biblical prophecy”.The ceremony coincided with massive protests, in which 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces.Thousands of miles away, in her home outside Colorado Springs, Kimberly Troup sat in a cluttered basement office. She is an evangelical Christian who takes to heart the Bible verse in which God speaks of the Jewish nation: “I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse.”Accordingly, she has devoted 22 years to Israel. She is now the US director of Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, an advocacy group with a Zionist ideology. Two other CFIC employees work with her. This week, they have been very busy. Ever since she was a child, in Kentucky, Troup has been immersed in Israel. Her father saw the creation of the state in 1948 and the six-day war of 1967 as evidence of biblical prophecy surrounding the end of the world. Troup believes in such prophecies, though she does not pretend to know when they will occur. She sees it as her Christian duty to care for Israel, to defend it against “Arabs” who are “not interested in peace”.As she described her position an associate, previously silent, spoke up, quoting the book of Isaiah: “You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.” Christians around the world have always had an intense interest in the Holy Land. It has often been believed that the restoration of the Jews in Palestine will bring about a holy war between good and evil (as prophesied in the Book of Revelation), after which God will set up a holy kingdom on Earth. In the 1970s, Troup’s father was one of millions who purchased a book called The Late Great Planet Earth, which interpreted events in Israel as evidence that the great war of Armageddon would happen by the late 1980s. The non-fiction bestseller of the decade, it was followed by the wildly popular end times conspiracy tome The New World Order, by the televangelist Pat Robertson, and then the Left Behind novels and films, which concerned violent clashes in Israel that would bring about biblical prophecy. To outsiders, these pieces of doomsday pop culture seem like far-fetched lunacy. For millions of Christians, they are a roadmap to the end of the world.The recent move of the US embassy has solidified the notion – not shared by the Palestinian people – that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, an essential piece of the end times puzzle. In a recent poll of evangelicals from LifeWay, more than half of respondents said end times prophecy was the reason they supported Israel. However, even in Colorado Springs, which in the heyday of the George W Bush administration was unofficially known as the “Evangelical Vatican”, such interpretations of the move are not universal.“We’ve been through all this before,” said Bruce McCluggage, a former evangelical who now identifies as a “follower of Christ”. Throughout his youth, in the 1970s and 80s, McCluggage was part of the Christian movement that interpreted the signs of Israel as evidence of the last days. But for McCluggage, after a slow-burn of things not coming to pass, that conviction slowly faded.“It was a classic tool used to witness to people,” he recalled. “We’d ask: ‘If Jesus returned today, would you go to Heaven?’ It was kind of a threat … and we thought, with Israel coming together, we could hasten the return of Jesus.” With long blond hair and a stout little chin beard, McCluggage still looks like a member of the California Jesus People, a movement of post-hippie Christians who were obsessed with end times prophecy. (The term “left behind” comes from a popular song of the era, I Wish We’d All Been Ready, by Larry Norman, the godfather of Christian rock.) He still attends church, prays and reads his Bible, but has slowly distanced himself from the Christian right.Today, he sits in the Wild Goose Meeting House in downtown Colorado Springs, a venue known for its “post-evangelical” or “progressive evangelical” contingent. It looks like any other hip modern coffeehouse, serving expensive pour-over coffee and craft beers to an indie rock soundtrack. Books with titles like Christianity After Religion and The Rebirthing of God line the shelves events like What Would Jesus Brew? – beer-centric Bible study – regularly take place.The hallmarks of the old Christian rightwing culture are still present: it’s very white, middle-upper class, and peppered with soldiers in fatigues. The town has five military installations. But the shop is representative of a shifting attitude toward Christianity in downtown Colorado Springs – one that doesn’t have much interest in the apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding Israel.“There are plenty of young millennials downtown that would call themselves evangelical, even conservative, but are a very different breed from their parents,” said Russ Ware, co-owner of the Wild Goose, who grew up evangelical but no longer identifies that way. “They’re mostly not Trump supporters they have a spectrum of views on LGBT issues, and they’re not on board with the end times theology … There is definitely a kind of end times fatigue with this generation.”This “post-evangelical” generation was raised on a steady diet of low-budget movies and pulp novels that injected a potent fear of the coming Rapture, a dynamic most eloquently described by the late Billy Graham. “I pick up the Bible in one hand,” he said, “and I pick up the newspaper in the other. And I read almost the same words in the newspaper as I read in the Bible. It’s being fulfilled every day round about us.”In the 1990s, Christopher Stroop was one such evangelical. He has now abandoned his faith and leads a social media campaign seeking to galvanize “exvangelicals” with hashtags like #emptythepews and #raptureanxiety. He said he had “definitely seen a lot of ex-evangelicals talking about being triggered by the Jerusalem news”.It’s not only post-evangelicals who are dubious about the end times scenario. Kimberly Troup believes Israel will be the center of Armageddon, but she doesn’t think it’s all happening now. The author of her father’s favourite book released follow-ups that predicted ever-later dates for the Earth’s demise. She is dubious about anyone who claims to know when the world will end.“The great fear was moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be the start of World War Three and Armageddon,” she said. “There’s a little rumbling, but nothing new. We’ve had this for 600 years. It’s gonna be business as usual … “It feels worse than it is because you only hear about the bad stuff on the media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c14350da8d726c795bcd8d4ed933775707153f/0_1969_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2c94653984f9495b13d44d2b475244","title":"exposed how to disappear from the internet","story":"Worried about what’s out there about you? You’re not alone. But is it even possible to become a digital ghost?Early one morning last year, before the birds were up, Tio Bucard, his wife and children skittered down the path from their home in a tiny French village towards a black SUV, its engine running. As Bucard drove to the local airport, he checked his rear-view mirror every few moments to see that he was still being followed by Frank Ahearn, a 54-year-old American with a peppery beard and wraparound sunglasses. Bucard (not his real name) had met Ahearn for the first time only the day before, in the lobby of a Monaco hotel close to Bucard’s office. Now he had entrusted his family’s safety to this former drug addict from the Bronx. Bucard pulled into the airport’s long-term car park. Then he and the family transferred into Ahearn’s hired SUV. As they pulled on to the motorway, Ahearn joked whether, while the family was in hiding, he could look after Bucard’s £5,000 watch, a Bentley Flying B No 3.The watch was a reminder of more plentiful times. Bucard, who raised capital for a private equity firm, had recently found himself on the wrong end of a bad deal. Problems gathered and the firm began to default on payments. One of the slighted investors had, as Bucard puts it, “a shady past” and angry phone calls soon blackened into threats of physical violence. Fearing for his and his family’s safety, Bucard typed the phrase “how to disappear” into Google. Halfway down the first page of results, he saw Ahearn’s name. A former New York skip tracer – a private investigator who finds people who have “skipped” town – turned professional “disappearer”, Ahearn offers a range of freelance services, everything from helping to restore your privacy on the internet to driving your family across Europe and into a new life.“My idea was to go away for three to four months,” Bucard tells me. “Just until I could raise the funds to pay back my investors.” Not wanting to cause alarm, Bucard told his children they were taking an extended vacation. The day before they fled, Ahearn rented an Airbnb in a far-flung city in his name. When the family arrived at the safe house, Ahearn bought new mobile phones and laptops, then schooled the family on the rules of their new life: do use untraceable text-messaging services don’t use public email servers do pay in cash don’t use Facebook. After a few days, Ahearn left the Bucards in their temporary accommodation and returned to his home in Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend. In his wallet, he carried Bucard’s credit card.When he landed in Spain, Ahearn tried to imagine what a man of Bucard’s wealth might indulge in while on holiday. Then he began a riot of spending: fine clothes, meals out, a king’s ransom of trinkets. “I had a blast with his plastic,” he says. “And that, my friend, is how to leave a trail of super-cool disinformation.”Money, violence, indiscretion: the motivation for any person who wants to disappear, either physically or digitally, usually wends back to one of these. Whatever the reason and whatever the scale of the ambition – from starting a new life in a foreign country to scrubbing one’s name and address from the phonebook – it has never been harder to vanish. In a world where almost any action outside your garden shed leaves some kind of digital footprint, there is no clear path back to the realm of the unknown.In recent months, the scale of the erosion of our anonymity has become dauntingly clear. In humming, ice-cooled server farms, the monoliths of Silicon Valley gather fat troves of personal information. This much we have known for years – as early as 2010, an investigation found that Facebook apps were routinely collecting information for internet-tracking companies without our consent – even from private accounts. But the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal brought new clarity. Those who downloaded their personal data files found that Facebook and its associated apps had been tracking phone calls, reading messages and plundering phonebooks.This gleeful, grasping attitude to our data is in the social network’s DNA. This year it was revealed that in 2004, while Facebook was still a university campus website on which male students could rate the attractiveness of female students, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, sent an instant message to a friend in which he boasted that he had collected more than 4,000 emails, pictures and addresses of people who had signed up to the service.“What?” Zuckerberg’s friend exclaimed. “How’d you manage that one?”“People just submitted it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’.”“Dumb fucks,” he added, after a pause.Facebook is not the only harvester of personal information. If Google is the engine that drives the internet, personal information is the oil that makes it purr. Via its Maps app, it knows where you’ve been, how you got there (foot, car, bus, train), how long you stayed and whether or not it was your first visit. The company stores your search history across every device on which you’re logged in, while algorithms reportedly scour your emails for signs that you might be pregnant, engaged or unwell. Google Lens, announced earlier this month, is a visual search engine that provides information about the things you’re looking at through your phone’s camera. Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched, every image you’ve searched for, whether or not you’re depressed and, possibly, even why you’re depressed before you do – and it’s far from the only omniscient god in the digital pantheon. What began as a hopeful, democratic mission to make the internet free for all in the 1990s has, when fed through the late capitalist mincer, resulted in a digital economy that runs on microtransactions of identity. This information, if held by a government, would inspire widespread civil liberty marches.For most of us, the quality and convenience of what we receive in exchange for our secrets is enough that we willingly surrender. But now an increasing number of people are more closely counting the cost – to the point of trying to reclaim our right to be unknown. It’s become a challenge: the woman fleeing an abusive relationship, the elderly victim of identity theft, the stalked celebrity, the school leaver who’s sabotaged their job search with old, embarrassing YouTube videos, already knows just how difficult that can be.When Ahearn finished rehab, aged 17, he had quit pills but was left newly directionless. He took a stopgap job in a New York shoe store. Then, when it closed down, he responded to an advertisement for a private investigator. The job was glamour-less, but Ahearn found it intoxicating nonetheless. He was hired to pose as a stockroom worker for high-end New York stores and catch co-workers stealing the merchandise. He caught 15 employees stealing from one department store, and later busted a 30-man criminal ring at an electronics and furniture warehouse. “Manipulation,” he says. “It’s the first thing I was ever really good at.”Carry out a self-styled “before” audit to see what’s out there. Search for yourself with all name variations, email addresses and residential addresses. You could be shocked by what you find.\u0026nbspAll active accounts must be deleted – not deactivated – if you want to use the internet untraceably. Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Tinder: they all have to go. It can be difficult to remember every site you have signed up for, so look in your email inbox for newsletters. Unsubscribe and ask to be removed from their data list the new GDPR update on 25 May 2018 means that sites are legally obliged to do this on request.It’s highly likely that personal data such as home address, email and even your date of birth is being publicly shared online by so-called data broker websites, such as 192. Ask for this information to be removed directly from the site, and they should comply.If you’ve posted on web forums, you can ask the webmasters to remove your posting. If they prove unresponsive, and data brokers or social media companies fail to remove your information on request, then exercise the “right to be forgotten” by a direct request to Google (search for legal removal request).Unfortunately, once removed does not mean for ever removed on the internet. You should actively audit yourself every six months and some of the steps may have to be repeated. And if you can’t quite make all the necessary sacrifices, consider setting up a false email address with inaccurate data, amending personal details such as age, sex, name and location.After a while, the private detective agency allowed Ahearn to work in the office. There he sat next to a skip tracer. “Skip-tracing is the art of finding people,” he explains. “There are two types of skip tracer: passive ones, who use databases and directories to find people and aggressive ones, who carry out social engineering to find their prey.” Ahearn would listen as his colleague extracted information about someone by calling utility companies and posing as the target in order to gain access to their phone records and bank details until, finally, he zoned in on a likely hideout address. Ahearn convinced his boss to give him a go. “I was like wildfire,” he recalls. “A natural.”In 1984, Ahearn left the detective agency and set up as a freelance skip tracer. For a while, business boomed. He would occasionally take short breaks (“Sometimes being so good at something so devious plays on the head”), but then crisis dawned when the laws in America changed, making many of the skip tracers’ techniques illegal. “Life became more difficult,” he recalls. Ahearn moved to Europe, where the laws were less stringent, and then, in the late 1990s, the pendulum swung back. The omnipresence of the mobile phone made it far easier to track iniduals, and the creeping ubiquity of social media ushered in a new golden era for the investigator. “I can find you through your mother’s Facebook, a blog you wrote three years ago, an old LinkedIn account,” Ahearn says.In 2001, he placed an advertisement on a website that provided advice about offshore living. When the website’s owner pointed out that Ahearn’s work finding people might concern its users, who, in many cases, prized anonymity, Ahearn suggested that he write a blogpost on how to disappear instead. “It was a really cheesy article, but it just blew up,” Ahearn recalls. “People from all over the world started contacting me.” Once he had weeded out those iniduals looking for an aider and abetter (“If you’re facing law enforcement, I cannot help you I also stay away from sexual issues”), Ahearn took on his first client: a woman who wanted to escape from her violent partner. “She didn’t want a new identity, just to move away and be sure that the husband couldn’t find her,” he says.In the past 15 years, the techniques Ahearn uses to ghost a client have grown in scope and sophistication. But unlike reputation management companies, which typically try to drive harmful or revealing information down search engine results, he favours the use of misinformation – and not just via misdirecting credit card transactions in a foreign city. “You can’t delete information,” he says. “It’s not going away. It’s a case of manipulating what is already out there.”If Ahearn is the special forces of the vanishment industry, brought in for the most extreme jobs, a sparse, open-plan office on the outskirts of Liverpool is home to the foot soldiers of this burgeoning industry. Here, at Reputation Defender, a team of 30 or so young men and women scour the internet for personal information – phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, electoral records – that their clients want removed from the internet.Managing director Tony McChrystal began working in online privacy and reputation management before there was a name for the industry. In 2008, when he joined the company, then known as Reputation 247, as one of its first employees, it had just five clients. “We were living hand to mouth, you know, never sure whether we were going to be able to open the doors the following month,” he says. Today, the company is one of the largest in its field McChrystal claims that the UK office receives 70 inquiries a day, mostly from iniduals who want to become unknown on the internet. To date, the company has served more than a million clients worldwide, and last month it was bought by the Washington-based Stagwell Group for an undisclosed sum.In the early years, McChrystal’s clients were typically celebrities, footballers and CEOs: people who wanted specific pieces of professionally damaging information about them – an affair, a failed business deal – pushed down the search engine rankings. In recent years, however, he says that the company mainly works with the kind of “regular” people who might pay for their credit file report every month, and who want a similar reputation or privacy report. For around £600 a year, the company will give you a list of what personal or sensitive information is publicly available. “A lot of the time, they’re scared of identity theft, fraud or even – if their current address is out there – scared of their own personal safety,” McChrystal says. It is surprisingly easy for a criminal to use social media to plan a burglary. “One of our clients’ daughter was on holiday in France recently at the family villa, and she posted geo-tagged pictures on Instagram of the villa alongside pictures of her and her friends wearing expensive jewellery and watches,” McChrystal explains. Within 24 hours of posting, there was a home invasion at the villa and half a million dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen. “After that, we had to go in and talk about how to manage their privacy settings on their Instagram and Facebook.”Like Ahearn, McChrystal and his team screen the motivations of potential clients. “We probably get two paedophiles call up every day,” he admits. This kind of inidual, McChrystal says, will typically claim they are the victim of mistaken identity: someone who shares their name has been accused of something awful. “That kind of thing actually doesn’t happen very often, so we tell them we will have to carry out a police check, and that’s when the conversation breaks down.” Team members refer to a “Who we serve” document, drawn up by the company’s lawyers, which forbids working with criminals who have been convicted of “anything above a misdemeanour”, as well as fraudsters and those who have been accused of sexual misconduct. “It’s not even up for debate. If you were found guilty of physical abuse, that’s relevant information to me. It shouldn’t be forgotten, you know?”Google agrees. In 2014, the European court of justice ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. In the past four years, the company has received more than 600,000 requests (many of which were submitted by the team at Reputation Defender on behalf of its clients) to delist nearly 2.4m results from the search engine. In many cases, Google has successfully argued that the information is in the public interest and that the petitioner does not have the right to be forgotten.In the past two years, however, McChrystal, who deleted his own Facebook account some time ago, has seen a marked increase in approaches from iniduals who are not in danger or want a piece of damaging information covered up, but who simply want to reclaim their anonymity.Emma Jones approached the team last year after one of her closest friends was the victim of identity theft. When Jones Googled herself, she found her name and address posted to various directory sites. “I wasn’t comfortable with my data being on the internet and there being nothing I could do about it,” she says. “I’ve got a young family. I felt exposed.” McChrystal’s team put together a dossier showing all the information on her and her family that was available online, alongside a proposal for how it might be removed or, in the case of social media sites, made private. Jones, who works in marketing, represents a new kind of client: one without a specific privacy problem who has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches that she is willing to spend hundreds of pounds hiring professionals to restore her anonymity.Like many people, she once used Facebook as a way of keeping a record of family life. “I’d upload photos of my children every day. I didn’t care whether or not my friends found them interesting. Now I rarely post pictures of my children – maybe the backs of their heads, but that’s it. It should be their choice, not mine. If my daughter comes to me when she is older and asks me why I put all those photos of her on the internet, I have no comeback.”In recent weeks, a grassroots movement has formed around the slogan Delete Facebook (Zuckerberg claims it has been a failure). For Meg Jayanth, a writer for video games, the Cambridge Analytica scandal pushed her willingly into Facebook oblivion. “I’d been considering deleting Facebook for at least a year, but my data anxieties were outweighed by convenience,” she told me. “Facebook was the way I stayed in touch with friends and family, and I was reluctant to leave it behind. The Cambridge Analytica news tipped the balance for me, not because it was unexpected, but because it forced me to stop rationalising away my use of the service, and act. I was sick of feeling apprehensive for using a service I didn’t even want to use any more.”The process of deleting one’s Facebook account is deliberately arcane. The social network encourages you to “deactivate” your account, rather than “delete” it, to leave an open door if you later regret the decision. Permanent deletion requires a request be made to the company. If you log in within 14 days of the process being under way (easy to do accidentally if you have the app on your phone or linked accounts that require you to log in via Facebook), the company will automatically cancel your original request.For Jayanth, who holds an Indian passport, the recent news that the US state department is asking visa applicants to declare their social media accounts on their forms was a further incentive. “The idea that customs officials might look through your social media, and could potentially make decisions based on whether or not you support the current government is dangerous. That could have a chilling effect on public debate.”Tio Bucard’s experience last year was enough to force a more thorough evaluation of his family’s privacy and safety. They never returned to their house in the French village.“This is something that happens to many of my clients,” Ahearn says. “Disappearing is a trigger that wakes a person up and makes one think carefully about what is next.”Ahearn founded a few offshore companies for Bucard, helping him buy a new house, cars and other essentials. He set the family up with a communications protocol, so they could keep in touch with family and business associates. Bucard and his wife decided to take the children out of the French education system and home school them. They took out private medical insurance to remove their names from the health system. To maintain a life of anonymity is an ongoing act of obsession, a symptom of which is often paranoia. Bucard has kept Ahearn on retainer whenever a new client comes his way, Ahearn runs checks on the person, to make sure they are who they say they are, and not connected in some way to his previous life.Complete invisibility is an impossible goal for anyone outside a witness protection programme (“The creme de la creme,” as Ahearn puts it. “If you have that, you have everything”), even for those who have never signed up for a social media or Google account. In Britain, unless you opt out when registering to vote, your data is collected and made available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.“People see the digital realm as being this separate thing, something close to unreal,” Ahearn says. “But it’s all the same thing. Would you put a picture of your child on a billboard next to a highway alongside your family name? Of course not. But people do it online all the time. And it’s not a problem.

It also argued that China has always resisted any “unreasonable demands” by the US, never compromising or accepting restrictive conditions. Last year, the US had a $375.2bn trade deficit with China, a source of frequent and bitter complaints by Trump. The US reportedly had demanded that the deficit be narrowed by at least $200bn by 2020.The statement said China will “advance relevant amendments to its laws and regulations” to allow for more American imports, including changes to patent laws.It also said both sides had agreed on “meaningful increases” in US agriculture and energy exports.Trump has threatened China with tariffs on up to $150bn of imports, prompting China to threaten US agricultural exports.The White House is wary of hurting largely Republican-voting farm states or damaging the economy before legislative elections this November. But Trump is also keen to appear tough on trade.On Thursday he unleashed a barrage of criticism against former US administrations for allowing Beijing to take advantage of the US.“We have been ripped off by China. And an evacuation of wealth like no country has ever seen before given to another country that’s rebuilt itself based on a lot of the money that they’ve taken out of the United States,” he said. “China has become very spoiled.”The trade talks are complicated by the impending summit meeting in Singapore between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who has consulted with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, ahead of the meeting.China is North Korea’s biggest trade partner, and Trump has called on it repeatedly to press Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.The statement made no mention of Chinese telecom giant ZTE, which had suspended operations after US sanctions were imposed to punish it for exporting sensitive materials to Iran and North Korea.Last week, Trump tweeted he and Xi were “working together” to find a way to help ZTE “get back into business, fast”.• Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3501843.1526756982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joint effort in attempt to preserve irish bee species","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorkers bees and a queen bee, yellow spot on back. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Researchers in universities across Ireland are to embark on a networking with communities in a joint effort to help Irish bees survive and thrive.It has been announced to coincide with the first ever World Bee Day on Sunday a UN initiative that aims to highlight the importance of preserving bees and other pollinators, and asks people across the world to take concrete actions to preserve and protect them.Bee populations in Ireland and across the globe have declined significantly, making them endangered. That decline has been accelerating in recent years, especially among native varieties. Of the 100 species of bees in Ireland one-third are threatened with extinction.“There is a growing population of environmental researchers in Ireland, and across Europe, that are working with the public and community-based organisations to help collect valuable data to track cause and negative impact on bee populations,” explained Kate Morris who manages the Campus Engage Network which is co-ordinated through the Irish Universities Association.“There is power in numbers, and growing understanding of the public that we too can take simple actions to make a change, to positively contribute to protecting the environment,” she added.Campus Engage is a national initiative set up for university researchers and staff to mobilise partnerships with community organisations and the public to help them in finding solutions to pressing societal challenges through research.Their bee project is informed by the 2015 All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP), an initiative of pollinator ecologist Prof Jane Stout from Trinity College and Dr Úna Fitzpatrick of the National Bioersity Data Centre, which was developed following a study indicating half of Irish bee species were in decline.Community engagement is central to its quest to make Ireland pollinator friendly, to raise awareness, and to support beekeepers and growers. In particular, it seeks to “create the evidence base for action” and track changes over time – by evaluating actions taken to enhance pollinators and monitoring bees across the island of Ireland using citizen scientists.“Everyone loves bees these days so it’s great to work with others to conserve bees,” Prof Stout said. “Our work relies on the goodwill of many different people – farmers, schools and businesses – allowing us to sample or set up experiments on their land, providing us with information on how the land is managed beekeepers providing us with honey samples to analyse and citizen scientists helping us to count flowers for bees.”Volunteers can log in, assess images of flowers, and contribute valuable data to help make a floral resource map of Ireland and identify hot spots for bees. “And in return, we do a lot of outreach and information sessions – with schools and the general public,” she said. For World Bee Day Prof Stout is kicking off a bee stewardship workshop series with a talk on bees and how they contribute to human wellbeing.The AIPP group is also working with Tidy Towns organisers in running a pollinator competition.Campus Engage and AIPP has outlined how iniduals and communities can best contribute to the preservation of bees and other pollinators:Ireland has a small but highly active beepollinator research community which recognises the importance of collaboration and fostering the sharing of expertise, according to Dr Jim Carolan of Maynooth University Department of Biology."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496108.1526392982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new furry prey for the windhover by any other name","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor raptors like kestrel (above) and barn owl, the influx of voles and greater white-toothed shrew  offers a change of diet. Illustration: Michael VineyWhere the hill behind us curves round to face west, there’s a stretch where it steepens sharply and is littered with glacial rocks. Any breeze from the sea – which is usual – bounces up the slope to let a kestrel hover there with spread wings and least effort: perhaps it has a wind-map in its mind of these things.“Windhover” is an old name for Falco tinnunculus (falco being the Latin for sickle, the shape of the wings, and tinnunculus for jingling, as of a bell and onomatopoeic for the kestrel’s rare cry). It is also a name I love, surviving the ecstatic densities of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s much-parsed poem. Pursuing the word’s history online brought me to a lively row over two supposedly ancient alternatives in historic English usage: “windfucker” and “windsucker”. The first is advanced in an online dictionary compiled by an American sociologist and author Douglas Harper (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001-2018). A criticism that the elongated “s” of old manuscripts has simply been misread has prompted vigorous and erudite exchanges (see Wiktionary: Talk: windfucker).The current balance of the argument seems to be that both words have sound provenance, with the “f” word in use as synonym for “beat” or “strike” – something vigorous, anyway – in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the other as having local usage from Kent to Orkney. Of much more interest scientifically has been a Finnish study in the 1990s, which showed the hovering kestrel’s ability to track voles on the ground below through ultraviolet (UV) reflections from the urine and faeces the rodents use to scent-mark their runways.In northern Europe, and notably in Scandinavia, there are broadly four-year cycles of change that synchronise crashes in the vole population with kestrel migrations over hundreds of square kilometres. When this happens, how do the birds seek out the most promising concentrations of voles?The Finnish researchers used captive kestrels in laboratory experiments to show that they detected vole scent marks in UV light but not in visible light. Then they moved out into field trials over some 100sq km of level farmland.They ided this into areas with and without artificial vole trails of urine and faeces, and without trails at all, and distributed kestrel nesting boxes between them, 15 to each. They watched the foraging, mostly male birds for 24 mornings as they hunted near the boxes the following spring and charted their special attention to the areas with artificial scent trails.Ireland had no voles until the bank vole, Myodes variolus, arrived in the 1920s with German earth-moving machinery brought in through Foynes to build the Shannon dam at Ardnacrusha. They now extend through nearly half the island, mostly in the south and west.Another alien invader, the greater white-toothed shrew, was discovered in 2008, its little bones showing up in disgorged pellets of kestrels and barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick. The shrew is thought to have arrived en famille in the root ball of a big plant imported to an Irish garden centre now, advancing at some 5km a year, it is colonising seven counties.Ireland has been poor in small mammal species, but the two newcomers have threatened those we have, and notably the native field mouse and pygmy shrew. The latter is disappearing altogether where both aliens are present.Such changes have brought what has been called “an invasional meltdown” to the ecosystems of hedgerow and grassland. And for raptors like kestrel and barn owl, it offers a change of diet.Dr Pat Smiddy, an ornithologist and conservation ranger, decided to take some measure of change by analysing kestrel pellets across 650sq km of east Co Cork and west Co Waterford – farmland within the aliens’ known territory. From nest sites in old and ruined buildings, many of which he knew, he collected 1,057 of the pellets.Teased apart for significant bones, every site yielded bits of bank voles, especially where the greater white-toothed shrew was also present. The pygmy shrew turned up mostly where the bigger shrew was absent and never where both aliens live together. Field and house mice and brown rat – traditional kestrel prey – were low in the percentage of remains.This research into Irish kestrel diet, the most comprehensive so far, shows how important the alien mammals have become for birds of prey and the impact of their competition with native furry species. Our birds of prey are changing too, as red kite, golden and white-tailed eagles have been introduced as apex predators, so that a whole new wildlife scenario heads into the problems of climate change.Dr Smiddy’s study is published in the Biology and Environment journal of the Royal Irish Academy.

They enjoyed a continental breakfast, prosecco and wedding cake during the ceremony which was watched on a big screen.Revellers and wellwishers paid €15 per person and numbers were limited to 75. Tickets sold out in a matter of days.Some might wonder why you would pay to watch the wedding in a theatre when you could watch it for free in your own living room, but attendees were keen to make a day out of the occasion.“There’s big interest in the fashion and celebrity aspect of it rather than the political side. It’s a fun day. We put a lot of effort into our events to make them as magical as possible,” said Ross McPharland, proprietor of the theatre.“We all recall Prince Harry walking behind his mother’s coffin. We shared that sorrow with him so I’m just really happy for him. It’s about being happy for a young couple,” said Deirdre Fox.Deirde Vandeweert said she came to the event “to enjoy the celebrations of a real life fairytale romance”. Vivienne White said it was “an excuse for a day out with the girls”.Sarah McIlroy (8) couldn’t wait to see “Meghan in her dress and the guests in their fancy outfits and hats”. Her sister Lizzy (10) was “excited to see the Queen”.“I enjoy the pageant, the service and the music. It’s wonderful,” said David Proger, who is originally from Britain.American Bishop Michael Curry’s exuberant speech had the entire room laughing while the newlywed’s first kiss prompted a collective swoon and clapping.“It was a perfect ceremony for a perfect couple. The dress was stunning and the royals were in good form,” said Colleen Despaquale.Michelle Bolger said the Bishop “was great and very funny” and that he “added entertainment to it”.Sight of the bride’s dress was eagerly anticipated, but the gown ided opinion when finally seen.Ashling Doyle said it was “stunning, classic, simple, elegant and timeless”, while others felt it was a little too boring for the amount of money it would have cost.An organisation called Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland had erected posters around the theatre several days ago in protest of the viewing party. The posters read: Greystones Against Royal Parasites. Smash British Normalisation.The group said anyone who watched the royal wedding “should be ashamed of themselves” but it did not show up to protest at the viewing party this morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500738.1526712296!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar backed 12 week proposal ahead of committee report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn publicly announcing his position last January, Leo Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he came to his own conclusion on how Ireland’s abortion laws should be reformed in advance of the Oireachtas committee which shaped the Government’s own proposals.Mr Varadkar largely kept his counsel as the committee conducted his work, and for weeks after it issued its report in December.However, he said on Friday he had reached the same conclusion as the Oireachtas body in advance but independently of the committee process which began in April 2017.The committee recommended the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed and to permit abortion without restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr Varadkar has said legislation would be introduced along these lines if the referendum passes next Friday.The Citizens’ Assembly, which laid the ground for the Oireachtas committee, had also recommended the introduction of abortion without restriction for the first 12 weeks.“I wanted to make sure we had a proper, deliberative process,” the Taoiseach told the Don’t Stop Repealin’ podcast, citing the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee.“It was only after that work was done that I really wanted to let people know about the conclusions about that I had come to as well, which was very much in line with that. I think if I had announced where I was heading earlier I might have been accused of trying to influence or put pressure on members of the all-party committee, which I didn’t do.“Having studied the facts, they came to a similar view as I did, very much independently.”In publicly announcing his position last January, Mr Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.“In making my decision to support it, I listened to the views of others – medical experts, the public, my party and Ministers, friends. Above all, I listened to women. I had to think long and hard about the provision for abortion without a specific indication in the first 12 weeks.”“The Taoiseach’s own views were formed over a period of time. There is no particular day on which they crystallised. He was very much informed by the views of the Citizens’ Assembly, the views of the party, the public, and the all-party committee. The most important thing is that next Friday, the Irish people will have their say on an issue of crucial importance for women.

Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"britain s prince harry marries meghan markle at windsor castle","story":"  May 19, 2018Ceremony saw break from tradition as bride did not vow to obey her husband "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500170.1526644221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monarchy in the uk the royal family s uncertain future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLondon barriers decorated with a royal family version of the Top Trumps card game. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday in Windsor Castle. Photograph: Paul EllisAFPGetty ImagesThe transatlantic soap opera surrounding Meghan Markle’s family has added a touch of drama to a royal wedding that has failed to excite most of the British public, according to a poll this week.The YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the anti-monarchist group Republic, found that two out of three respondents were “not very interested” or “not interested at all” in the ceremony, while 60 per cent planned to have a normal weekend.Prince Harry is the most popular member of the royal family, with an approval rating higher than the queen’s, but he is sixth in line to the throne, behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children, so his wedding is of no constitutional significance. It will have an economic impact, however, generating more than £1 billion in tourism, retail, fashion, merchandising and PR value for brands, according to accountancy firm Brand Finance.The company, which specialises in intellectual property and publishes an annual assessment of the brand value of the monarchy, found that brands associated with Markle had already gained a significant boost since her engagement was announced last year.“Meghan Markle is an accomplished actress in her own right, with a global popularity and a strong personal brand. It can be expected that, supported by her association with Brand Monarchy, she will become a powerful ambassador for British brands, especially in her native United States.“Although we are observing only the beginnings of a ‘Meghan effect’, Ms Markle will quickly match or even surpass the Duchess of Cambridge in her incredible influence on the fashion industry,” said chief executive David Haigh.Haigh estimates that the monarchy generates about £1.8 billion for the British economy each year, far outstripping the £300-350 million it costs the state. More than a quarter of a century after the queen’s “annus horribilis” of 1992, when Windsor Castle went on fire, Princess Diana’s tell-all book with Andrew Morton was published, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles’s intimate “squidgygate” phone calls were broadcast, and Prince Andrew separated from his wife Sarah Ferguson, the monarchy enjoys solid popular support.“When you talk to people rationally about whether the monarchy makes sense – should we have a monarchy or a republic, should we allow these hereditary people to have a say in the running of the country – when people are talking with their heads, they usually say, no not really. But I think emotionally people act in a different way. They think, oh it’s very nice isn’t it, it’s a great traditional thing and aren’t they nice people, a bit like East Enders. And then the heart kicks in,” Haigh says.Harry and his brother William are more popular than their father and his siblings, especially among the under-40s but it is the queen who, at 92, remains the linchpin of the monarchy. Its supporters are already anxious about the future after she dies.Detailed plans are already in place for the days after her death, including 12 days of public mourning leading up to a state funeral.“I think it’s pretty much tied down. There are various military planning documents that spell out exactly how the funeral will take place. Clearly the BBC and other state broadcasters have preparations for what they do. Most of the plans are predicated on the idea of the queen’s health fading and the announcement of her death being made at a particular time of day, a very controlled way of doing it. That of course is blown sky high if there’s a leak on social media or something,” said one official involved in the planning.“An interesting thing will be what the mood is about how long the BBC plays solemn music, do the newspapers have black edges, when do they start covering other stories. When do normal events start coming back onto the agenda.”After 65 years on the throne, the queen’s reign has been so long that few Britons can remember any other head of state, and the official predicts that, despite her age, the response to her death will be one of deep shock.“I think it’s impossible to overestimate the impact that the queen’s death will have, particularly in the rather febrile world that we live in at the moment. There’s so much uncertainty about Brexit, about international relations, our relationship with the United States, our economy, about our future as a country and our relationship with each other. And the one constant, the one thing that holds it all together is the queen,” he says.“She’s just been so much part of everybody’s life for such a long time, she has maintained this sense of fairness, of honesty, of fair play, of an old Britain that perhaps thinks it’s slightly more important than it is. And I think with her gone, all that is blown out of the water and I think that will hit people almost immediately, that nothing will ever be the same again. I think there’ll be a great baring of souls and fear, in a sense of ‘what happens now?’”The pageantry and deference surrounding the queen, which seems unremarkable in association with her, could feel more like an anachronism under a new monarch. Charles has recovered from his lowest point in the public’s affections after Diana’s death but he remains the most unpopular of the senior royals.This is in part a legacy of his unhappy union with Diana and his subsequent marriage to Camilla, but it also owes something to his record of seeking to influence politicians and his sometimes bad-tempered campaigns in favour of complementary medicine and against modern architecture.The official involved in planning for the succession believes that Charles should make an early gesture towards reducing the scale of the monarchy, bringing it closer to those of Denmark and the Netherlands.“If they’re seen to have too many fripperies, too many luxuries, too many private planes, too many palaces, too many numbing bits of protocol, then that’s where the problems will begin. If they’re sensible, then they’ll immediately trim things back.“The complication is that a lot of it is theirs anyway, and there’s nothing very much that the state can do about it. In a sense, Charles’s Achilles’ heel is his reputation for being lavish, for taking the royal train, for chartering jets, for having six butlers when one would do and having someone to squeeze his toothpaste tube and cut the top off his egg. I think that’s what he’ll need to watch,” he says.“It’s very easy to defend the current monarch and to trot out the line about what she means to Britain’s reputation, what she means for tourism, what she means for our sense of who we are. I think it will be harder to do that for a new monarch, and I think if Charles is sensible, he’ll quite quickly make a couple of gestures, perhaps giving up a palace, perhaps saying that Buckingham Palace is going to become an art gallery to house the royal collection and maybe a state guesthouse but no longer a residence.”A poll last year found that two out of three Britons do not want Camilla to become queen but the official believes she will overcome any remaining hostility to her as they become more familiar with her.“Camilla is in a way the best thing about Charles. She’s very straightforward, she’s down to earth, she likes a joke, she’s got that great, rasping smoker’s cough, she likes a drink. She’s in a sense the person who’s made Charles much less weird,” he says.For Haigh, the biggest threat to the monarchy lies in the personal behaviour of members of the royal family. He fears that the fanfare surrounding Markle’s arrival into the royal family as an American orcee of mixed racial heritage could sound hollow if, like so many recent royal marriages, Harry’s does not endure.“All of the problems that have arisen around Prince Charles and Prince Andrew and Prince Edward and various minor royals, they all come down to their personal behaviour. Whether it’s being accused of taking money where they shouldn’t or giving favours where they shouldn’t or behaving in a bad way or having opinions which are too extreme, there are a lot of personal behavioural issues,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Now I personally think it’s extremely unlikely that Meghan Markle will put a foot wrong. I think the real danger is that for some reason or another they don’t suit each other and eventually they fall out and split.“The other real problem, which is now looming bigger and bigger every day that goes by, is her remarkably dysfunctional family. I must admit that I was really surprised that they completely excluded all her family.“I think if she had invited her family to the wedding, she’d have a better chance of controlling what they do. Instead of which, they’re all going rogue as far as I can see. It’s bonkers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales.The bride\u0027s evening dress is designed by Stella McCartney and is a bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe.Royal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Duke and Duchess of Sussex: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s new titles explainedHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s royal wedding day: Best moments, pictures and talking pointsSurplus Army rations handed out to feed the homeless under MOD plansLeading girls’ schools sends pupils on negotiating courses to get pay rises\u0026#39No-frills\u0026#39 funerals on the rise as families fear of engaging with deathGastro-trickery: how optical illusions could fool our minds and our taste budsWho is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?Royal wedding guest list: Celebrities from the Clooneys to the Beckhams, and Pippa MiddletonInside the royal wedding evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and a chance for the newlyweds to let their hair downPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding day: Best moments, pictures and talking pointsComment: This British fairytale was a display of our country\u0026#39s unique \u0026#39soft power\u0026#39Royal wedding flowers designed by \u0026#39floral mastermind\u0026#39 Philippa Craddock Their Royal Cuteness: Princess Charlotte sticks her tongue out as George hides behind his mother\u0026#39s legsSir Elton John \u0026#39performs Circle of Life\u0026#39 for Meghan and Harry at royal wedding reception Royal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Thomas Markle says his \u0026#39baby\u0026#39 daughter Meghan \u0026#39looks beautiful\u0026#39 - and that he wished he was at weddingThe Hollywood kiss: Meghan Markle asks Prince Harry if they should embrace - and groom answers \u0026#39yeah\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"muslims around world celebrate ramadan pictures","story":"Hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world began fasting on Thursday from sunrise to sunset for the month of Ramadan, a time of contemplation, fortitude and intense worshipPeople attend the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi What next for newlyweds Meghan Markle and Prince Harry?

Congratulations once again to the newly-married Duke and Duchess of Sussex. #royalwedding.The celebrations culminated in a black-tie wedding dinner staged at Frogmore House and hosted by Charles for 200 of the couple\u0027s closest friends and family. James Corden reportedly acted as compere.The married couple arrived at the evening reception in ultimate style - riding in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, which was originally manufactured in 1968 and has since been converted to electric power to Frogmore House in Windsor.The car\u0027s number plate bore the date of the wedding - E190518 - and Prince Harry proved he was the perfect gentleman as he opened the door of a vintage car to let his bride step in, as he drove her to their private evening reception in a scene akin to a James Bond film.Earlier, at the top of the vast West Steps, where the West Door was decorated with hundreds of cream and white flowers and green foliage, Harry and his bride stopped and kissed to the delight of cheering onlookers.The Queen\u0027s grandson and the American former actress, who is now an HRH and a member of the British royal family, said their vows in front of 600 guests including the monarch and more than 30 members of the Royal family.Ms Markle wore a stunning elegant white gown - with a white veil and boat neck - was created by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female Artistic Director at French fashion house Givenchy. Prince Harry and his best man the Duke of Cambridge are both wearing the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. Cutest pictures of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and more young royals at the weddingAs they met at the altar, Prince Harry told his bride you look amazing, to which Meghan replied thank you. The couple tenderly held hands and exchanged smiles during the wedding ceremony.Ms Markle\u0027s delicate veil was five metres (16ft) long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads, with two of her page boys carrying the ends as she made her way up the steps.Her hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen.The Duke of Cambridge, in his role as best man, stepped forward to deliver the rings, with the couple smiling as they placed the bands on each other\u0027s hands.Unlike his brother, Prince Harry has chosen to wear a wedding ring.The most stylish guests from Prince Harry\u0026#039s wedding to Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Ms Markle gazed into each other\u0027s eyes as they exchanged vows.Loud cheers could be heard from outside St George\u0027s Chapel as the Archbishop of Canterbury proclaimed the couple husband and wife.Prince George and Princess Charlotte did not follow directly behind Harry and Meghan as they made their way back up the aisle, like the other bridesmaids and page boys.Instead, the youngsters held the hand of their parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they made their way out of the chapel.As they left the chapel they paused on the steps where a smiling Ms Markle looked up at her new husband and asked: Do we kiss? Harry replied with a discreet: Yeah.The new Duke and Duchess travelled in the Ascot Landau waving to the thousands of royal fans lining the streets and up the Long Walk, with Ms Markle exclaiming wow at their rapturous welcome. As the horse-drawn carriage returned to Windsor Castle ready for a lunchtime reception in the magnificent St George\u0027s Hall, Prince Harry quipped: I\u0027m ready for a drink now.Ms Markle has become the first mixed race person in modern history to marry a British senior royal. She found fame in the US legal drama Suits playing the character Rachel Zane, and a number of her former co-stars, including Patrick J Adams and Gabriel Macht, were there for her big day.Missing though, was Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle, who was thousands of miles away in Mexico after pulling out just days ago due to ill health.Ms Markle\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, was there for her daughter and the Prince of Wales was asked by the bride to step in and walk her up the aisle of the Quire to meet Prince Harry.The couple joined their guests for a reception in Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen. Here, the Prince of Wales described how emotional he felt watching his youngest son, whom he still remembers so clearly as a baby, marrying the love of his life.As he addressed 600 guests gathered at the reception St George’s Hall, there was barely a dry eye as he spoke so warmly about his darling old Harry and the man he had grown into.The Prince described how moving it was, at this point in his life, to watch his little boy move on. A little boy, whom he had winded so often as a baby and whom, he joked, might still have a bit of wind today.Guests described how warmly he welcomed Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, to Windsor and into his family. Frequently, throughout the course of the reception, he was spotted with his arm around Mrs Ragland.Fantastic news that we have a Duke and Duchess of Sussex again after a gap of just 175 years - double celebrations today for Meghan and Prince Harry and all of Sussex, said Tim Loughton, Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham.The wedding was forecast to attract a global audience of 1.9 billion people. This is how it was reported around the world.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been congratulated on their wedding by one of Meghan\u0027s former Suits co-stars.Gabriel Macht, who plays the lead role of Harvey Specter on the show, posted a picture to Instagram of him and his wife Jacinda Barrett, who accompanied him to the wedding.Despite not being invited to the Windsor Castle wedding, the Hello singer donned a fascinator and veil for the big occasion and toasted the happy couple from her home with a glass of champagne.Adele remembered Diana, Princess of Wales in a poignant message to the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day.Ms Markle’s cousin, Noel Rasmussen, the 19-year-old daughter of Samantha Markle, was not invited to the ceremony, but made a deal with a tabloid newspaper to travel from her home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and be in London for the day.“Meghan looked so beautiful.

Mozart probably wrote his Piano Concerto no 18 for her. She became blind at an early age but that didn’t stop her musical career. This piece probably isn’t by her – it was probably by the 20 th century violinist Samuel Dushkin. This song has been endlessly re-arranged. It’s the single most popular song by this late 19th – early 20th century composer. It sounds like a piece of Latin church music, but in fact it’s one a set of songs Schubert composed in 1825, all based on poems in Sir Walter Scott’s epic ‘The Lady of the Lake’. This one is based on a prayer uttered by Ellen in front of the Virgin Mary, asking for forgiveness for her father’s sins. All stand for the next hymn: Guide me, O thou great RedeemerView of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Notable not only for striking a Welsh note (appropriate for the wedding of the son of the Prince of Wales) but for its family resonances. It was sung at both Kate and William\u0027s wedding and Diana\u0027s funeral and so its inclusion may well be among the ceremony’s most poignant notes.Prayers are now being led by Archbishop Angaelos and The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin from the Nave. The Archbishop says: In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan  have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other.

In the presence of God I make this vow.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle before they say their vowsAfter that effusive sermon, next up Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir are singing Stand By Me, Ben E King’s 1960 pop song.View of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: It’s not a sacred piece, but the words have the just the right sentiment. It’s all about standing by your loved one in testing times, and it was inspired by the spiritual “Stand by me Father” – which itself refers to Psalm 46. The Performers are Kingdom Choir – 20 singers based in South-East London directed by Karen Gibson. The website says “They are a unique group of dedicated men and women, who blend Choral discipline with the raw Gospel spiritual sound – drawn from an inner experience.The Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, gave an address titled the Power of Love at the service in St George\u0027s Chapel.He opened his speech with the words of Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who said: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.The bishop then added: There\u0027s power in love. Don\u0027t underestimate it. Don\u0027t even over-sentimentalise. There is power, power in love.Bishop Curry told the service: There\u0027s power in love. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion.

It became massively popular and could have earned him a fortune.Holst taught at St Paul’s School for Girls and composed this in 1912 for the school orchestra. This movement based on 16 th century English balladParry, a leading light of the so-called ‘English Renaissance’ who was the first director of the Royal College of Music in 1883. He wrote his Lady Radnor’s suite in 1894 for the all-women orchestra conducted by Helen, Countess of Radnor. It’s a kind of Baroque Suite in Victorian dress.Set of dances based on a book of Renaissance dances composed by Peter Warlock (gifted composer who died in 1930 aged 36).Vaughan Williams was a collector of folk-song, and wrote many pieces based on the songs he found.

It’s a kind of Baroque Suite in Victorian dress.Set of dances based on a book of Renaissance dances composed by Peter Warlock (gifted composer who died in 1930 aged 36).Vaughan Williams was a collector of folk-song, and wrote many pieces based on the songs he found.

Let’s call this place the West. These lands had once been ravaged by bloody wars but its rulers had, since, solved the puzzle of perpetual progress and discovered a kind of political and economic elixir of life. Big Problems were relegated to either Somewhere Else (the East) or Another Time (History). The Westerners dutifully sent emissaries far and wide to spread the word that the secret of eternal bliss had been found –and were, themselves, to live happily ever after. So ran, until very recently, the story of how the West was won. The formula that had been discovered was simple: the recipe for a bright, shiny new brand of global capitalism based on liberal democracy and something called neoclassical economics . But it was different from previous eras – cleansed of Dickensian grime. The period after the two world wars was in many a Golden Age: the moment of Bretton Woods (that established the international monetary and financial order) and the Beveridge report (the blueprint for the welfare state), feminism and free love.It was post-colonial, post-racial, post-gendered. It felt like you could have it all, material abundance and the moral revolutions a world infinitely vulnerable to invention – but all without picking sides, all based on institutional equality of access. That’s how clever the scheme was – truly a brave new world. Fascism and class, slavery and genocide – no one doubted that, in the main, it had been left behind (or at least that we could all agree on its evils) that the wheels of history had permanently been set in motion to propel us towards a better future. The end of history, Francis Fukuyama called it – the zenith of human civilisation. Austerity in Athens: the eurozone crisis hit Greece not once but twice (Getty)While liberal democracy was the part of the programme that got slapped on to the brochure, it was a streamlined paradigm of neoclassical economics that provided the brains behind the enterprise. Neoclassical economics, scarred by war-era ideological acrimony, scrubbed the subject of all the messy stuff: politics, values – all the fluff. To do so it used a new secret weapon: quantitative precision unprecedented in the social sciences.It didn’t rest on whimsical things like enlightened leadership or invested citizenship or compassionate communities. No, siree. It was pure science: a reliable, universally-applicable maximising equation for society (largely stripped of any contextual or, until recently, even cognitive considerations). Its particular magic trick was to be able to do good without requiring anyone to be good.And, it was limitless in its capacity to turn boundless inidual rationality into endless material wellbeing, to cull out of infinite resources (on a global scale) indefinite global growth. It presumed to definitively replace faltering human touch with the infallible “invisible hand” and, so, discourses of exploitation with those of merit. When I started as a graduate student in the early 2000s, this model was at the peak of its powers: organised into an intellectual and policy assembly line that more or less ran the world. At the heart of this enterprise, in the unipolar post-Cold War order, was what was known as the Chicago school of law and economics. The Chicago school boiled the message of neoclassical economics down to a simpler formula still: the American Dream available for export – just add private property and enforceable contracts. Anointed with a record number of Nobel prizes, its message went straight to the heart of Washington DC, and from there – via its apostles, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank radiated out to the rest of the globe. Now the world is ready to embrace MarxismIt was like the social equivalent of the Genome project. Sure the model required the odd tweak, the ironing out of the occasional glitch but, for the most part, the code had been cracked. So, like the ladies who lunch, scholarly attention in the West turned increasingly to good works and the fates of “the other” – spatially and temporally. One strain led to a thriving industry in development: these were the glory days of tough love, and loan conditionalities. The message was clear: if you want Western-style growth, get with the programme. The polite term for it was structural adjustment and good governance: a strict regime of purging what Max Weber had called mysticism and magic, and swapping it for muscular modernisation. Titles like Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson’s Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty and Hernando de Soto’s The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism  Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else jostled for space on shelves of bookstores and best-seller lists. Another led to esoteric islands of scholarship devoted to atonement for past sins. On the US side of the Atlantic, post-colonial scholarship gained a foothold, even if somewhat limp. In America, slavery has been, for a while now, the issue a la mode. A group of Harvard scholars has been taking a keen interest in the “history of capitalism”.Playing intellectual archaeologists, they’ve excavated the road that led to today’s age of plenty – leaving in its tracks a blood-drenched path of genocide, conquest, and slavery. The interest that this has garnered, for instance Sven Beckert’s Empire of Cotton, is heartening, but it has been limited to history (or worse still, “area studies”) departments rather than economics, and focused on the past not the present. As far back as the fifties ... the economy was driving the society, when it should have been the other way around  (Getty)Indeed, from the perspective of Western scholarship, the epistemic approach to the amalgam of these instances has been singularly inspired by Indiana Jones – dismissed either as curious empirical aberrations or distanced by the buffer of history. By no means the stuff of mainstream economic theory. Some of us weakly cleared our throats and tried to politely intercede that there were, all around us, petri dishes of living, breathing data on not just development – but capitalism itself. Maybe, just maybe – could it be? – that if the template failed to work in a large majority of cases around the globe that there may be a slight design error.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

The best-selling author and my colleague at Cambridge, Ha-Joon Chang, in Kicking Away the Ladder, pointed out that it was a possibility that the West was misremembering the trajectory of its own ascent to power – that perhaps it was just a smidgen more fraught than it remembered, that maybe the State had had a somewhat more active part to play before it retired from the stage. But a bright red line separated the “us” from the “them” enforcing a system of strict epistemic apartheid. Indeed, as economics retreated further and further into its silo of smugness, economics departments largely stopped teaching economic history or sociology and development economics clung on by operating firmly within the discipline-approved methodology.  So far, so good – a bit like the last night of merriment on the Titanic. Then the iceberg hit. Suddenly the narratives that were comfortably to do with the there and then became for the Western world a matter of the here and now. In the last 10 years, what economic historian Robert Skidelsky recently referred to as the “lost decade” for the advanced industrial West, problems that were considered the exclusive preserve of development theory – declining growth, rampant inequality, failing institutions, a fractured political consensus, corruption, mass protests and poverty – started to be experienced on home turf.The Great Recession starting 2008 should really have been the first hint: foreclosures and evictions, bankruptcies and bailouts, crashed stock markets. Then came the eurozone crisis starting in 2009 (first Greece then Ireland then Portugal then Spain then Cyprus oh, and then Greece, again). But after an initial scare, it was largely business as usual – written off as an inevitable blip in the boom-bust logic of capitalist cycles. It was 2016, the year the world went mad, that made the writing on the wall impossible to turn away from – starting with the shock Brexit vote, and then the Trump election. Not everyone understands what a CDO (collateralised debt obligation) is, but the vulgarity of a leader of the free world who governs by tweet and “grabs pussy” is hard to miss. So how did it happen, this unexpected epilogue to the end of history? I hate to say I told you so, but some of us had seen this coming – the twist in the tale, foreshadowed by an eerie background score lurking behind the clinking of champagne glasses. Even at the height of the glory days. In the summer before the fall of Lehman Brothers, a group of us “heterodox economists” had gathered at a summer school in the North of England. We felt like the audience at a horror movie – knowing that the gory climax was moments away while the victim remained blissfully impervious. Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi\u0027s party sweeps to key victoryIs India\u0027s tourism \u0027pro-poor\u0027 if it fails to reduce absolute poverty?Chinese investment in Africa \u0027could create dependent economies\u0027The plot wasn’t just predictable, it was in the script for anyone to see. You just had to look closely at the fine print. In particular, you needed to have read your Karl Polanyi, the economic sociologist, who predicted this crisis over 5 years ago. As far back as 1954, The Great Transformation diagnosed the central perversion of the capitalist system, the inversion that makes the person less important than the thing – the economy driving society, rather than the other way around.Polanyi’s point was simple: if you turned all the things that people hold sacred into grist to the mill of a large impersonal economic machinery (he called this disembedding) there would be a backlash. That the fate of a world where monopoly money reigns supreme and human players are reduced to chessmen at its mercy is doomed. The sociologist Fred Block compares this to the stretching of a giant elastic band – either it reverts to a more rooted position, or it snaps. It is this tail-wagging-the-dog quality that is driving the current crisis of capitalism. It’s a matter of existential alienation. This problem of artificial abstraction runs through the majority of upheavals of our age – from the financial crisis to Facebook. So cold were the nights in this era of enforced neutrality that the torrid affair between liberal democracy and neoclassical economics resulted in the most surprising love child – populism.The simple fact is that after decades on promises not delivered on, the system had written just one too many cheques that couldn’t be cashed. And people had had just about enough. The Brexit vote in 2016 followed by the election of Trump ... and the world had finally gone mad (Getty)The old fault lines of global capitalism, the East versus West dynamics of the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Round, turned out to be red herrings. The axis that counts is the system versus the little people. Indeed, the anatomies of annihilation look remarkably similar across the globe – whether it’s the loss of character of a Vanishing New York or Disappearing London, or threatened communities of farmers in India and fishermen in Greece.Trump voters in the US, Brexiteers in Britain and Modi supporters in India seek identity – any identity, even a made-up call to arms to “return” to mythical past greatness in the face of the hollowing out of meaning of the past 70 years. The rise of populism is, in many ways, the death cry of populations on the verge of extinction – yearning for something to believe in when their gods have died young. It’s a problem of the 1 per cent – poised to control two-thirds of the world economy by 2030 – versus the 99 per cent. But far more pernicious is the Frankenstein’s monster that is the idea of an economic system that is an end in itself. Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist about it, but the current system doesn’t work because it wasn’t meant to – it was rigged from the start. Wealth was never actually going to “trickle down”. Thomas Piketty did the maths. Suddenly, the alarmist calls of the developmentalists objecting to the systemic skews in the process of globalisation don’t seem quite so paranoid. But this is more than “poco” (what the cool kids call postcolonialism) schadenfreude. My point is a serious one although I would scarcely have dared articulate it before now. Could Kipling have been wrong, and might the East have something to offer the mighty West? Could the experiences of exotic lands point the way back to the future? Could it be, could it just, that it may even be a source of epistemic wisdom? Behind the scaffolding of Xi Jinping’s China  or Narendra Modi’s India, sites of capitalism under construction, we are offered a glimpse into the system’s true nature. It is not God-given, but the product of highly political choices. Just like Jane Jacobs protesting to save Washington Square Park or Beatrix Potter devoting the bulk of her royalty earnings to conserving the Lake District were choices. But these cases also show that trust and community are important. The incredible resilience of India’s jugaad economy, or the critical role of quanxi in the creation of the structures in what has been for the past decade the world’s fastest-growing nation, China. A little mysticism and magic may be just the thing. The narrative that we need is less that of Frankenstein’s man-loses-control of monster, and more that of Pinocchio’s toy-becomes-real-boy-by-acquiring-conscience less technology, and more teleology. The real limit may be our imaginations. Perhaps the challenge is to do for scholarship, what Black Panther has done for Hollywood. You never know. Might be a blockbuster.Dr Antara Haldar is the inaugural lecturer in Empirical Legal Studies at the University of Cambridge.

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

There are also 181 peers sitting as crossbenchers.Lords defeats government to back EU eco-standards after BrexitCorbyn ‘must take chance to keep UK in single market’ after May defeatPeers inflict major defeat on government over single marketLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMs May shelved plans earlier this year to slash the number of peers, after a cross-party report recommended cutting the numbers in the Lords from nearly 800 to 600 in a decade.The Lord Speaker’s Committee recommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.   However Ms May retreated from the more radical plans, which she said needed “careful thought” and instead pledged to show “restraint” in her appointments.Meanwhile, Ms Osamor’s elevation was described as a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, after the campaigner signed a letter protesting against the suspensions of party members over antisemitism.Gideon Falter, chairman of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “Mr Corbyn has promised action, not just words, against antisemitism in the Labour Party.“Today his actions speak louder than ever. By elevating Ms Osamor to the peerage, Mr Corbyn has sent an unmistakable signal to those in the Jewish community who still harboured some hope that he might change.”I’m a millennial and I’m sick of how entitled my peers areMs Osamor said in a statement that she was “implacably opposed to antisemitism” and had spent her life campaigning against racism and discrimination.Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the move was a “desperate bid” by Ms May to reduce opposition to her flagship Brexit legislation in the upper chamber.“The fact that she is doing this on the Friday evening before the royal wedding is frankly pathetic,” he said.“This is a desperate grab for power by a regime losing its grip on parliament, public opinion and even its own back benches. The Prime Minister is running scared of the mounting criticism of her disastrous handling of Brexit.“These appointments show the PM isn’t serious about reforming the Lords and smacks of hypocrisy.”Tommy Sheppard, the SNP’s Lords spokesman, described the decision as a “real affront to democracy”.He added: “The Tories are not even trying to disguise this – it is a complete fix.“By creating even more peers in a desperate attempt to force through their chaotic Brexit they are showing a despicable disregard. Even for the Tories this is shabby.’’ UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWorkers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The rendition of God Save the Queen even brought applause from those gathered in the bar.Every so often Ms Rodriguez, who works in fashion, would snap a picture of the screen, in order for her to create an gallery of the best hats and fascinators to share on her Instagram feed later. American media went to great lengths to cater to this audience, which is not surprising given that, Wallis Simpson aside, this is likely the closest an American has got to the British royal family since the Boston Tea Party. Television and news networks NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, TLC, HBO, Hallmark, and E! all offered a live stream with commentary.  PBS were using coverage from the BBC, in addition to the UK broadcaster showing it on BBC America.Among the 5,000 members of the international media covering the wedding, NBC set up five vantage points along the procession route for the newlyweds, and most major US television networks planned hours-long extended editions of flagship programmes, including staples like Good Morning America. Up to 23 million Americans watched the coverage of the wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011 – with network bosses likely hoping for similar figures.Meanwhile, across the country, events and viewing parties were taking place in hotels, pubs and homes everywhere from Los Angeles – where residents got up at 3am – to towns in Florida and the Rocky Mountains.“The phone hasn’t stopped,” Mr Robertson said of the rush for table reservations at his two establishments. “In the last two weeks, it has been constant.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

The day marks the killing of six Arab Israelis during 1976 demonstrations against Israeli confiscations of Arab land.Iran, for its part, has close links with the Hashd al-Shaabi and the group led by the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki and will be wary of Mr Sadr’s Iraqi nationalism. Mr Abadi stays in power until the formation of a new government, which he may lead in an alliance with the Sadrists.Mr Sadr is perceptive about political developments in Iraq. When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The account said “history spits in the face of the country’s traitors”.The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front page a photo of Ms Hathloul and Ms Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brexit: UK has until JUNE to strike EU deal on Northern IrelandFew want a hard border and Brexiteers say it would be avoided if the Republic also quit the EUWe want to see a bit of leadership.Pro-Brexit MPs believe that Mr Varadkar is trying to hold them to ransom over the issue of the Irish border. Last week, Mr Varadkar claimed that Britain was in danger of \u0026ldquocrashing out of the EU with no deal.However, former Irish ambassador Ray Bassett told MPs that the border was being used as a \u0026ldquoTrojan horse to make the UK stay in a customs union.He also called for a constructive strategy towards a technological solution \u0026ndash the so-called \u0026ldquomax fac option for trusted traders. Yesterday, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who compiled the Top 10 list, said: \u0026ldquoThe best result of the Irish border situation is for the Republic of Ireland to leave the EU with the UK and be free of the shackles of Brussels with its closest allies and biggest trading partners, the UK and the US.EPABrexiteers are attempting to go over the head of the pro-EU Irish prime minister Leo VaradkarMr Bridgen will promote the bid at a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which he is a member, next month.The group includes British MPs and peers, and Irish MPs and senators, and was created as one of the measures for greater co-operation that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.Polls suggest about nine in 10 Irish voters want to stay in the EU. Mr Bridgen conceded that the EU was popular in Ireland but said that was after four decades of investment.He added that \u0026ldquostorm clouds were on the horizon, including the \u0026ldquothreat of tax harmonisation from Brussels and talk of an EU army, which is a challenge to Ireland\u0026rsquos policy of neutrality.He also said that the Irish were being used as a \u0026ldquopawn by an EU determined to see an outcome that might not be in their interests.He said: \u0026ldquoThe methods being employed by EU negotiators at present are the biggest threat to the peace process and it\u0026rsquos high time Ireland\u0026rsquos ruling politicians realised that, acted in their national interest and told the EU to work constructively for solutions.David Davis meets EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels ahead of a crunch meeting of European Union leaders later this week                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10British Brexit minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in Brussels\u0026ldquoIf not, I suspect enthusiasm for the EU will dwindle in Ireland and a country so keen on referendums will be calling another on their future membership of the European Union.In a referendum in 2001, the Irish public threw the EU into a tailspin after it rejected the Nice treaty on EU expansion.At the time, campaigners warned that changes to the internal rules of the EU would leave smaller countries such as Ireland at a disadvantage.

Heres who we know turned up.The wedding invitations were printed on March 22, and the couple kept fairly tight-lipped about their guest list.There were not as many wedding guests as when Prince William tied the knot in 2011, but that was to be expected.Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests but St Georges chapel, Harry and Meghans venue, holds 800 people.They also invited 2,640 members of the public on the day to the Windsor Castle grounds including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities. Around 600 people were invited to the service which took place at St Georges Chapel on Saturday, May 19.Unfortunately those wanting a glimpse of Prince Louis on the day were disappointed, as the palace confirmed he would not be attending - instead being cared for by a nanny nearby on the day.It was confirmed on May 16 that Prince George will be page boy and Princess Charlotte will be a bridesmaid at the Royal Wedding.On Harrys invite list were ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, while Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan also made the cut. All three of Princess Dianas siblings attended - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer.A fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney all showed up.Several of her Suits co-stars flew over for the big day - Patrick J Adams (who plays her on-screen love interest), Rick Hoffman, Vanessa Ray, Gina Torres, Gabriel Macht and Sarah Rafferty.Two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy both scored invites.George and Amal Clooney, Idris Elba, James Corden and Carey Mulligan were all spotted at the service too.David and Victoria Beckham, long-time friends of the Royals who have both been honoured by the Queen made the short trip to Windsor.US TV titan Oprah Winfrey was one of the surprise names to attend.Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and his wife, Princess Mabereng, who have worked alongside the Prince and his charity Sentebale since 2006, also attended.In addition to Donald Trump, a whole host of political big names including President Obama, his wife Michelle, and Theresa May did not make the cut.While David Cameron, then the Prime Minister, attended Prince Williams wedding in 2011 - the situation was different for Prince Harrys.A Kensington Palace spokesman explained prior to the event: It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markles wedding.Her Majestys Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.The Sun has revealed that Elton John would be attending the Royal Wedding.The Rocket Man cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the royal nuptials, which left him free to attend and perform.He arrived with his husband David Furnish and sang three songs during a lunchtime reception held by the Queen.The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Donald Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But government mandarins pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sank to their lowest ebb since his election last year.Either way neither Obama or his wife Michelle were at the big day.The ushers, bridesmaids and page boys were  revealed as the day approachedUshers:Bridesmaids:Page boys:Numerous members of the public were selected to watch outside the chapel when the couple get married.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He stroked Meghan’s finger as he slipped a Welsh gold ring on it.As his bride made her vows, her watching mother Doria nodded in agreement - smiling, but also appearing a bit tearful.Meghan slipped a platinum band on Harry’s finger and Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev and Rt Hon Justin Welby pronounced them husband and wife.A huge cheer rang out from the crowds gathered outside in the spring sunshine.The couple - who were given the title The Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the Queen yesterday - sealed their union with a kiss.As they climbed into their carriage they were waved off by a bridal party that included Harrys nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.An estimated 100,000 people flocked to Windsor and one billion around the world watched on TV.Prince Philip, 96, displayed his gritty determination by walking into the church unaided - in his first public appearance since hip replacement surgery on April 4.The dress focuses on the open bateau neckline that slightly shows the shoulders, with a figure fitting sculpted waistline.Its made of six seams, with a flowing train and an underskirt made of triple silk organza.It also has three-quarter length sleeves.Givenchy also created the stunning five metre long veil, which is decorated with hand-embroidered flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth - a design detail requested by Meghan. It is made from silk tulle with the floral decorations made out of silk threads and organza.The workers who made the veil spent hundreds of hours making the intricate design - and had to wash their hands every THIRTY minutes to keep the materials pristine.The front of the veil shows crops of wheat blending into the flora, to symbolise love and charity.Meghans heels are made of aptly named duchess satin and have a pointed toe.And for the mini-mes - Givenchy also designed the six adorable bridesmaids dresses.Each dress is high waisted with short puffed sleeves and a silk ribbon detail at the back, tied into a bow. The dresses were made of a prestigious fabric called ivory silk radzimir.Handily - they came complete with pockets, and pleated skirts.The “Iron Duke” walked in ramrod straight and without crutches to take up his seat in chapel next to the Queen.Invited guests included Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney and Victoria and David Beckham.A roar went up when Harry and best man William, who both served in the military, appeared in their Blues and Royals uniforms.Harry looked edgy and hot in the heat as they walked down from the castle for the noon service.William, 35, did his best to calm his younger brother as they waited for Meghan to arrive at the chapel.A lip reader told how William turned to Harry and joked: “Your turn now bruv.”Meghan was driven to the chapel’s west steps with her four page boys in mini Blues and Royals frock coats and six bridesmaids. As she climbed up the 22 steps, her 16ft veil and train - decorated with the flowers of all 53 Commonwealth countries - fanned out.There were “something blue” ­forget-me-nots - favourites of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana - in Meghan’s bouquet.The service was led by Dean of Windsor, The Right Rev David Conner, who addressed the couple by their full names - Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan.But after that the ceremony took on a less formal and more contemporary feel.American bishop, The Most Rev Michael Curry, 65, wowed the gathering with an electrifying address. At one point Harry turned to Meghan and mouthed “Wow.”The Queen looked a little alarmed by the preacher’s fire and brimstone and thumping of the lectern.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKFinally, after a full 13 minutes, he concluded: “We’re gonna sit down, gotta get y’all married.”The informal tone was cemented as the Kingdom Choir - a group of 20 gospel singers - belted out Ben E King’s pop hit Stand by Me.The ceremony ended with the Etta James version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine –- a further sign of the couple’s eagerness to break the mould.The Royal groom had already shown his romantic side, handpicking several flowers yesterday from their private garden at Kensington Palace to add to the bespoke bridal bouquet that included forget-me-nots - his mother Dianas favourite flower.Watching on was a star-studded crowdthat included the Clooneys, the Beckhams and Elton John - who performed at the lunchtimes reception.A gospel choir sang American soul singer Ben E. Kings 1960s hit Stand By Me to the couple, who had earlier been given their new titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.The Royal Family were front and centre in the chapel, with the Queen and an unaided 96-year-old Prince Philip - recovering after a hip op - cheered as they walked into the chapel this morning.The Duchess of Cambridge was also among the guests, making sure that bridesmaid Princess Charlotte and pageboy Prince George were on their best behaviour.Newborn Prince Louis didnt make an appearance - staying at home with the nanny.Hundreds of people had poured into St Georges chapel for the ceremony, including Princess Dianas brother Earl Spencer, Prince Harrys ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy and Kates pregnant sister Pippa Middleton and mum Carole.Tennis champ Serena Williams, Lady Kitty Spencer, Chloe Madeley and James Haskell and Meghans Suits co-star Patrick Adams and singer James Blunt were also there.Marcus Mumford of Mumford and Sons, and Princess Dianas butler Paul Burrell were also snapped heading into the chapel."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407459793.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry royal wedding speech elton john meghan markle","story":"It followed an emotional speech from Prince Charles about Prince Harrys childhood - before Elton John brought the house down with an impromptu concert.The future king, 69, is thought to have used his closing remarks to pay tribute to Meghan Markle - and reportedly commented on how beautiful the couple are together.A guest told People: It was very off-the-cuff, which was lovely.

an honour bestowed by the Queen.It is the Queens prerogative that senior members of the royal family are promoted in line with their peers because they hold royal military appointments.Harry left the armed forces in June 2015 and was first spotted with a beard in September the same year.He kept his beard when he wore a military dress coat at the Cenotaph last November – a move which prompted criticism from some quarters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000397064452-e1526750742680.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"manchester arena bombing soulmates year on","story":"They were going to move in together this year and take their first foreign holiday as a couple.Next year they hoped to marry and within three years become parents.Tragically they will never be able to do any of those things because Liam, 19, and Chloe, 17, were two of the 22 people who lost their lives in the Manchester Arena suicide bomb attack on May 22 last year.Tuesday marks the one year anniversary of the atrocity at the Ariana Grande concert and today, in a moving interview, their parents reveal how they will spend the day remembering the “perfect couple”.Liam’s mum Caroline told us: “We will concentrate on the joy they brought into the world. We have become one family, just like we would have been when they got married. We know that would make them so happy.”Holding Caroline’s hand Chloe’s mum Lisa added: “They were the perfect couple and had their entire future mapped out.“They were so excited about moving in together this year and taking their first foreign holiday together to Spain to celebrate Chloe’s birthday in August.“Two years later they were going to get married then two years after that they said they would have children.“They were so mature and in love we were absolutely certain they were doing the right thing.“We feel fortunate they had already experienced and achieved so much during their lives.“They had the type of love most people spend a lifetime searching for and were completely inseparable.“I truly believe they were destined to be together. They were so similar we sometimes get confused which one we are talking about.”The couple, who had been together for three years, had huge dreams.Chloe, who was studying music at Newcastle College and had auditioned on X Factor, wanted to be a singer or a music teacher and Liam, who was studying sports science at Northumbria University, loved playing cricket.Both worked part time at the Hilton hotel in Gateshead, where a special ball will be held in their honour next month.Their dreams were cut short by the terrorist who targeted innocents leaving the concert.This week police revealed that more than 800 people are now known to have suffered physical and psychological injuries after the bombing.Or you can organise you own fundraiser and pass on the money to the trustees.The donation will be used to help aspiring artists and athletes who have been hand-picked by a board of experts.For details go to the Facebook page – facebook/ChloeAndLiamTogetherForever/.Speaking from the Rutherfords’ home in South Shields, South Tyneside, where the walls are adorned with heart-shaped photographs of the couple, the mums explained they did not want to talk about the extremist who committed the atrocity.Caroline said: “We want to concentrate on Chloe and Liam and all the joy they brought into the world — and the legacy we can build for them now.”Lisa added: “Chloe had been a huge fan of Ariana ever since she appeared on the American TV show Victorious.“She couldn’t believe it when she found out she was playing a concert so close to home. She was very excited to see her perform.”The families now want to look to the future, and are devoting their own lives to helping the stars of tomorrow.They have set up the Chloe and Liam Together Forever Trust to provide support to talented youngsters as they explore their passions in music and sport. Lisa explained: “Liam and Chloe’s dreams were stolen from them before they could make them come true. They were born to be together and we want to do everything we can to ensure their love lives on for evermore.”Chloe’s dad Mark, 47, a former confectionery worker and Lisa, 47, a former banker, have joined forces with Caroline, 47, to run the trust.They have also helped Caroline cope with the loss of both her son and his dad, Andrew, who died of cancer, aged 49, just a short time before the attack.Lisa said: “After Liam and Chloe died we were overwhelmed with how many people contacted us offering to raise or donate money in their honour.“Even strangers were messaging us saying they wanted to do something. We wanted to do something with all that generosity and the idea for the trust came to us almost straight away.“So we are raising money to help promising musicians and athletes of any age.“The amount we donate varies but we are already helping a talented ballet dancer with his tuition fees and we are also funding a talented archer so he can buy the equipment he needs.“The dream is that one day we will help someone perform at a West End show in London, or compete for a gold medal at the Olympics.“We are trying to help the stars of tomorrow realise their goals and do the things my daughter and Liam would have liked to do. We’re in a position that the kids are never forgotten and although their ambitions were torn away from them, somebody else’s children will hopefully be able to fulfil their potential — and that’s because of Chloe and Liam.“Chloe had such a pure and beautiful voice. She loved singing and would perform at events all the time.“She would have loved to have been on the big stage one day but she also wanted to become a music teacher.“That’s why we really want to turn this terrible tragedy into something positive.”On Tuesday hundreds of locals in South Shields will wear the trust’s colours of pink and blue as they gather next to the permanent memorial bench in the couple’s honour next to the Town Hall.Mark said: “It’s hard to describe what we’ve been through. There are days when you don’t want to get out of bed because you feel you have got nothing to get up for.“Sometimes you don’t want to leave the house and you can’t do anything but sit and cry.“But the trust has given us the strength we need to carry on.“It’s become a full-time job dealing with everything that goes with it and we know that Liam and Chloe would be so proud of us for what we are doing.“That is what keeps us going and what makes it worth getting out of bed in the morning — knowing that despite this tragedy we can bring some good into the world.”A BRAVE band of terror attack survivors are calling on the public to help them combat extremism.The group, which includes people caught up in the Manchester Arena atrocity, say more must be done to “take on the evil” that has claimed so many lives.In an open letter, members including Becky Rigby, 35 – the widow of soldier Lee Rigby, who was murdered on a London street in May 2013 – issue a clarion call on how to stop the extremists before they strike.The group say: “With just two days to go until the anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack, which also marks the murder five years ago of Fusilier Lee Rigby, we would like to ask the public, as well as honouring those we have lost, to think about how you can become part of the solution to terror.“We are a group of survivors of terrorism. Some of us were injured ourselves, others have lost loved ones. In all cases, the scars of those moments are deep.“As we know from our own experience, terrorists have targeted the innocent regardless of faith, ethnicity or politics, for generations.“Our members have lost loved ones to nationalists, Islamists and far-right extremists.“What binds these extremists together is not any particular belief.“It is the hatred of people not like them and the willingness to use violence against innocent civilians.“It is this we must take on and defeat. When terror hits, we all feel an impotent rage. We all want to help the victims and take on the evil that drives the attacks – but how?”The letter is signed by more than 40 relatives of terror victims who have lost loved ones to groups including IS and the IRA.Signatories include Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn, 29, died in the Manchester Arena attack, and Gina Van Dort, 32, who was shot in the face and lost her husband Chris Dyer, 32, in the Tunisian beach attack of 2015.Their aims include:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is more to be done. One wedding will not change that.But yesterday we saw a Britain, and a Royal Family, that has moved into a new era.Princess Diana would have loved it.Nothing would have amused her more than how unconventional some parts of the ceremony were, or pleased her more than the number of hard-working charity staff who were invited to join in.The forget-me-nots in Meghan’s bouquet, Diana’s favourite flower, were a touching tribute. The Queen looked at once the distinguished Head of State we are used to and a doting grandmother.This was Britain’s biggest moment on the global stage since the opening of the London Olympics.Just as we did that night, yesterday we revelled in our heritage but announced that we were looking forward to an even brighter future.We wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex the happiest of lives together.Here’s to them and our Great Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good. In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She clung to it all day.In an exclusive interview to mark the ten-year anniversary of his death, Brooke, 34, tells how the pain of losing her brother never leaves her.She said: “My wedding day was the happiest I have had in ten years. But my husband Simon never met Ben, the boy I loved more than anything else in the world.“It was in December. We’d had dreadful weather but that morning the sun came up. I knew my little angel would make it shine. He was there in his own way.“Mum made my flowers and put a locket with Ben’s picture in. I held it all day. My dad did a beautiful speech saying Ben sprinkled a little bit of magic over us on the day I met Simon.“We raised a glass and cheered but I couldn’t help crying.”To celebrate finishing their GCSEs, Ben and his friends were out in June 2008 near his family home in Islington, North London, when he was attacked by Juress Kika, Jade Braithwaite and Michael Alleyne, then aged 19, 18 and 20.It was over an argument he had not been involved in. The trio spotted Ben and his mates walking to get a taxi and cornered him.They stabbed him 11 times in just five seconds. In 2009 all three got life after being convicted of murder.Brooke, in her capacity as consultant to scriptwriters on EastEnders — the soap in which she played Kelly Taylor for three years, has been going over Ben’s death for a forthcoming storyline.As the plot, involving Shakil, played by Shaheen Jafargholi, and Keegan, played by Zack Morris, unfolds tomorrow night on BBC1, viewers will see how knife crime shatters the community.Brooke said: “It’s a huge responsibility to get the truth out there about the devastation it causes. It was terrible reliving it but I don’t mind if it helps other families.”The murder rate in London is now higher than New York. Of the more than 60 murders in the capital this year, more than half were knife victims.Brooke, who helped set up the Ben Kinsella Trust to campaign and educate young people about the dangers of carrying knives, said: “We’ve worked so hard to make a difference. Ten years on I’d like to say we are in a better place. But I can’t.“Every time I hear of another death I’m distraught knowing what the family are going through.”With her dad George, 59, a London taxi driver and mum Deborah, 56, an office manager, the family also set up the Ben Kinsella Exhibition at Finsbury Library, North London.It features a life-size prison cell and actors who show some of the consequences of knife crime.Brooke said: “We mainly work with kids around ten, when they’re susceptible to peer pressure and bullies who tell them to do things.“Education on knife crime at this age should be on the curriculum. They give feedback afterwards and one ten-year-old boy wrote, ‘One stab physically does a million mentally’. It shows the maturity they have at that age.“They know people who head out the door with phones, keys and a knife.“We explain they’re more likely to be harmed if they carry one but some think there are safe places to stab someone.“I hate knives. I know all the injuries that Ben had, how long and deep they were. When I see a knife of the same size I freeze.”Ben and Brooke were very close, living at home with their two ­sisters. Brooke said: “He was one of my best friends. He’d creep into my bed and watch Friends. We would read the Harry Potter books together. He never got to read the last one.“He was a wonderful young man and an annoying little brother who played pranks.“I hate that his killers will be out when they’re 40, have another life with family and kids. Life should mean life.”Next month the family will be asking people to do “Ten for Ben”.Brooke said: “We’re holding a memorial and a 10k walk.“We are asking kids all around the country to do ten acts of kindness for his charity, like making a cup of tea or doing some shopping for an elderly person.“We want to counterbalance the cruelty out there with kindness.”October is always tough, because that is when Ben would celebrate his birthday. Last year, Brooke did not get out of bed. But smiling now, she says: “On his 25th we did the things he’d never done — drank pink champagne, went to the casino, played ping pong. He’d have loved it.”She is convinced he would also have loved her husband, lawyer Simon Boardley.Brooke, a talent manager, met him through TV’s Judge Rinder — or “Judge Tinder” as she calls her husband’s Sun columnist pal.In December last year, 18 months after meeting, Brooke and Simon married.Brooke said: “It hurts so much that he never met Ben. I’ve shared Ben’s memory box with him, with his toothbrush in case we can clone him one day, a theatre ticket from our visit to see Wicked, and Ben’s ­Oyster card and art work.“Simon has brought happiness back into my life.“When you get married you think about having children but I worry about the world.“The thought of bringing a child into it truly petrifies me.“I know just how dangerous it can be.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She came home, went to her bedroom and didn’t come out. It took her a few days to get back to normal. Aimee knows she looks different from other girls. She gets on with her life and disability as best she can.“But to have it pointed out to her like that in front of school friends really affected her confidence.”Mum-of-six Stephanie, a careworker from Tipton, West Mids, said she and Aimee faced cruel questions for years.She added: “When she was a baby I tried to ignore stares, but people were rude.“As she grew older she tried to laugh it off but it hurts.” Doctors first thought the small lump was due to a traumatic birth but it grew bigger. Aimee has had four ops but with little success.In the last, two years ago, surgeons found the fatty tissue was so near a nerve that removing it risked paralysis.Police apologised after Stephanie complained about the blunder at High Arcal School in Dudley.Insp Andy Pugh said: “A small number of students were asked not to chew sweets. One was mistakenly told off who wasn’t part of the group. The officer immediately apologised to her.“Her mum called to complain and we again apologised.”He said Stephanie was told how to make a  formal complaint but had not. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Guests and spectators at Windsor Castle cheered and the chorus of approval was echoed by TV millions around the world. For this was the happiest of days as Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, tied the knot in a ceremony stripped of stuffy formality and loaded with warmth, love, inclusivity – and an inspirational sermon by US bishop Michael Curry. The couple flashed a thousand smiles – maybe more – as they lapped up every moment. Harry constantly stroked Meghan’s hand as they shared loving glances.  After stepping from 14th century St George’s Chapel, Meghan asked Harry: “Do we kiss?” He gleefully said: “Yeah.” Moments earlier the cheeky Prince had told Meghan: “I’m ready for a drink now!” The couple had smiled throughout a memorable service which saw Meghan arrive at Harry’s side and greet him with one word: “Hi.” The prince was left open-mouthed by his stunning bride and told her: “You look amazing.” She replied: “Thank you.” Harry also told Prince Charles “Thank you, Pa” after he walked Meghan part-way down the aisle.  The wedding began at midday after more than 600 guests arrived with military precision – the earliest at 9.30am. Kensington Palace had announced earlier that the Queen had given the couple the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The first royals entered just before 11.30am. Ten minutes later Harry and brother Prince William, his best man, strolled through the castle grounds and entered the West Door.  They wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals. Ex-soldier Harry had his Pilot Wings badge on his chest, which he got for flying Apache helicopters. A fanfare played as The Queen entered. She wore a lime, lemon, purple and grey printed silk dress by designer Stuart Parvin and a hat by Angela Kelly.  Harry and William had a 10-minute wait for the bride and filled it chatting, giggling and mouthing “hello” to guests who included actor George Clooney, TV’s Oprah Winfrey, singer Sir Elton John and soccer’s David Beckham. Beaming Meghan arrived at 11.57am in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, passing huge crowds along Windsor Castle’s famous Long Walk. Her mother Doria Ragland, 61, was beside her and wore a custom-made lime dress.  The bride stepped out to give the world its first glimpse of her stunning white silk gown, created by British designer Clare Waight Keller, artistic director at Givenchy. Palace sources said Meghan worked closely in its creation. The 16ft veil included a flower design from each of the 53 commonwealth countries. Her tiara was Queen Mary’s 1932 Diamond Bandeau, loaned by the Queen.  And her simple bouquet of white flowers contained several blooms handpicked by Harry from their garden in Kensington Palace. Meghan had four page boys – William’s son Prince George, Harry’s godson Jasper Dyer, six, and twins John and Brian Mulroney, the seven-year-old sons of Meghan’s pal Jessica. One of the little bridesmaids shed a tear and had to be comforted by a nanny. But it was the tiniest of blips. As Meghan stepped into the chapel, sunlight streamed in behind her and there were gasps from guests. Harry looked a little flushed as he realised the moment had arrived.  There were six bridesmaids – William’s daughter Princess Charlotte, three, Harry’s god-daughters Zalie Warren, two, and Florence van Cutsem, three, Meghan’s god-daughters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven, and Ivy Mulroney, four. Greeting the couple, the Rev David Conner – the Dean of Windsor – said: “We have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan.”  The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Rt Rev Justin Welby, then took over as Harry and Meghan looked at one another and held hands. They smiled and grinned as he asked if anyone objected to their marriage. The Archbishop asked the Prince: “Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?”  He replied: “I will” and burst into laughter upon hearing cheers from outside the chapel. Asked the same question, Maghan grinned: “I will” – which was again greeted by cheers. The couple swapped rings made by Cleave and Company. Meghan gently cradled Harry’s hand as he placed a ring fashioned from Welsh gold on her finger.  She then gave Harry a platinum band with a textured finish. They were declared husband and wife at 12.40pm to huge cheers from within the castle grounds and beyond. American bishop Michael Curry then had the congregation enthralled with a 13-minute sermon which drew a massive thumbs-up on Twitter.  Quoting Martin Luther King Jr, he said: “We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new word. Love is the only way.” He added: “There’s power in love. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love, knows what I mean.  Such power can be seen in the service. Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.” The charismatic clergyman had Harry and Meghan in hysterics, telling them: “We’ve got to get ya’ll married!” Gospel singers The Kingdom Choir gave a powerful rendition of Stand By Me and cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 19, played three pieces.  Above all, the day was encapsulated by smiles. Prince Charles beamed with pride. And the Queen and Prince Philip – fit again after his hip replacement – looked as happy as ever. The air of informality was typified as cameras picked up Mike Tindall stroking the baby bump of wife Zara, daughter of Princess Anne.  After signing the register the newlyweds joined in the National Anthem before leaving the chapel to cheers. Then came that kiss... and a joyful carriage procession through Windsor to the delight of a 100,000 crowd.

Dodd admitted he used to be a street yob addicted to cannabis who made life a misery for ordinary people. The 33-year-old , who turned professional in 2012 after a glittering amateur career, later won the WBC International Lightweight title and then the Commonwealth Lightweight title. But he\u0027s now revealed what life was like before his glittering sporting career, growing up in Birkenhead, Liverpool.  He told the Liverpool Echo that during his time growing up on the Exmouth estate he received a phone call threatening his life.  He said: “I had been out with my mates in Birkenhead.  We ended up in a nightclub, and there was a bit of a disagreement. To be fair we had tried to calm things down. We were stood outside the club and I think a woman involved had phoned her husband. “Anyway the woman’s husband and his mates came down the club. I remember they were older than us. There was a confrontation and then a fight, which we won. “We all forgot about it but then I received a phone call telling me there was \u0026pound10,000 on my head, and there people coming over from Liverpool to shoot me or something because I had upset a gangster. “So I told the person on the phone that I would be at the Queens pub on Conway Street from noon tomorrow.  “So my mates and I all went down to the Queens and sat outside in the carpark drinking, waiting for them. Nothing happened, but it could of. And what would I have done if it had?” Dodd, 33, explained that he had to fight on a daily basis growing up on the streets of Birkenhead, and quickly fell in with a group of local hard lads. He said: “We became streetrats, always hanging around and causing trouble. We made life a misery for ordinary people, smashing windows and vandalising cars. We used to hit people during robberies, from lads in the park to anglers.” He said that when he got older the group began drinking, smoking drugs and fighting in pubs. He said: “It was all about football, drinking, smoking skunk and fighting. Obviously this lifestyle started to take its toll. One of my friends had a sort of breakdown and was sectioned.”  Sean said that one of his friends received a long prison sentence after he was involved in a serious incident in Birkenhead town centre. He said: “They were out and got involved in a disagreement with some bloke. He chased after my mate, who then tuned around and swung at him. The man was later admitted to hospital, and sadly died and my friend was jailed. I was not there at the time but I could have been.” Dodd said that his addiction to skunk cannabis became a growing problem. He said: “It became my life. I remember a period of time when all I wanted was \u0026pound20 to be able to buy a bag of skunk. I did not have enough money to heat my flat or feed my dogs. I remember sleeping in long johns and socks to try and keep warm. I was rock bottom and I had nothing.” Dodd said that an invitation to a boxing show changed his life. He said: “My uncle knew I was going through a bad patch and invited me to a boxing show. I remember seeing a 15-year-old local lad box, and that was it for me. I wanted to be him.

Joanna said: I reported the problem about four or five weeks ago. I said the toilets were absolutely disgusting.  I asked for the council to spend four or five hours deep-cleaning the walls and tiles and they said they were sending their team in but two weeks later nothing had happened. I spoke to them again and still nothing happened. So a couple of weeks ago I cleaned the sinks myself with bathroom cleaner. I could run my fingernail through the grime. She added that the toilets were once again in a terrible state when she visited at about 3pm on Thursday, May 17.  Joanna said: Which cubicle do you use? The one with faeces on the toilet seat and in the pan, the one with the vodka bottle on the floor or the one with loo roll all over the floor? There\u0027s limescale on the worktops and grime on the tiles. Is this what we want visitors to see when they come to this lovely town? I want the council to do a deep clean once a fortnight and top it up every day. Several people have shared their thoughts about the toilets on Facebook .

There’s a touch of Donald Trump Fake News in the aggrandized billing of royalty’s latest wedding as the world’s greatest since, well, the last one conveniently involving the groom’s brother and best man. I’m not against Harry Wales and Meghan Markle. Indeed I send them my best wishes, as I do to everybody else who wed today (the others not charging us a small fortune, it should be noted). And I desperately hope this is a happier fairy tale than the 1981 edition mis-sold by stand-in father of the bride Charles when poor Di proved a lamb to the slaughter.  But I am against an elitist monarchy and today we were in the silent uninterested majority – 66% or two-thirds of us according to pollster YouGov – who felt what BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell diplomatically termed “polite indifference to it all”. Street party-free swathes of Britain and bustling shops on a sunny Saturday told us far more about public enthusiasm, of the lack of it, for the establishment production than the fawning subjects who’d travel to watch the Queen order a flunkey to pick up a corgi’s poo. If that in Windsor was the best the royals can do after months of North Korean propaganda, Harry Jong-un’s summit with his American darling hailed as an international moment of supreme importance, there’s hope yet for us republicans.  Leave me out of the monarchy myth when royalty performs a pernicious political purpose in adding a respectability gloss to unearned privilege and extreme inequality. Look up to them and the subservient look down on themselves, Windsor as much a people’s event as Eton’s a people’s school or Clardige’s is a people’s hotel. How mean not to feed the 1,200 “commoners” instructed to bring picnics as they stood in the grounds of Windsor Castle, unpaid TV extras denied even crumbs from the rich family’s table.

Karen Land was on the brink of death when she was given just months to live in December - but has defied all odds and is now cancer free. The mother-of-five was so unwell that she could barely climb a flight of stairs, breathe or talk without struggling. But the community came together to raise money for lifesaving immunotherapy, and combined with Karen\u0027s fighting spirit, their efforts paid off.  Scans taken on May 16 showed the disease has disappeared and there is no evidence of any cancer anywhere.    She told Lincolnshire Live: It\u0027s the best news I could have hoped for. I am now officially in remission.  I feel a bit like a walking miracle considering I was supposed to be dead by now. My consultant has said that I am one of a few people that just respond really well to treatment. She now has three weeks of radiotherapy to endure and will need a scan every three months, and there could still be a chance she will relapse in the next 12 months. Her dream job was in her grasp after she completed her firefighter training course until the terrible diagnosis came through.  She thought she would never have the chance to put her new found skills to the test in real life as a result. But that could now all change. The second best news I had was when I asked the doctor if I could return to work, she said. He said it’s not a unrealistic expectation. I’ve just got the radiotherapy to complete and a bit of work on my fitness to do. I already have a appointment to see occupational health next week so I am hoping in the next two months I can get back. Karen has even stopped donations coming into her Just Giving page. I’ve decided to end my Just Giving page for the time being and if the time comes in the future where I need treatment again or immunotherapy I will look at starting it up again, she said. She will start oxygen therapy but will use the donations or reopen the page if she needs immunotherapy in the future. Karen also spoke about the nightmarish eight months she and her family endured. Being told I had months left to live in December was the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced, she said. I actually got to the stage where my body was just overrun with cancer I couldn’t breath, talk and even climbing a flight of stairs was a massive task.

Its licence plate is today\u0027s date - E190518 - which will, of course, be the pair\u0027s anniversary. Harry, who drove Meghan through the Windsor Great Park in the early evening sunshine, was dressed in black tie. The party-loving prince is said to have requested a Tiki-themed bar for his and Meghan\u0027s wild carnival and festival-themed \u0027afterparty\u0027.    Guests will reportedly be welcomed by a steel band before feasting on South African wagyu beef and quaffing iced beers, champagne and ice luges filled with vodka, in a throwback to Mahiki - the groom\u0027s favourite London nightclub. Prince Charles, who will host the private evening for the couple\u0027s inner circle, is expected to pick up the tab for the 200-strong party. Harry\u0027s polo pal Nacho Figueras posted a picture of his black tie evening outfit to Instagram, simply writing: Part 2.  Earlier, Harry and Meghan had shared a tender kiss on St George\u0027s Chapel\u0027s steps after pledging their love to one another at their wedding. The bride had donned an elegant and simple pure white gown, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, for the ceremony. Her delicate veil was five metres long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza. Her hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen.

The RNLI has launched a campaign highlighting the risks, saying it is far more likely a human will drown than an animal. More than 200 people have lost their lives walking around the coastline since 2011, many trying to rescue dogs. Jan Coles, 45, a company director, says a lifeboat crew saved her dog Blodwen’s life after she was swept out to sea on her beach walk. Like many owners, she wanted to leap in after the four-year-old staffie cross. But she fought the urge.

She was floating \u0026shyfurther and further away and there was nothing for her to cling on to. “It was so frightening. I was thinking of swimming out to try to rescue her.

And she was delighted to be reunited with Jan, who says the experience has made her much more away of water safety. Jan, who had been walking near her home in Burry Port, near Swansea, last summer, said: “I can’t thank the RNLI enough. They saved Blodwen and stopped me from trying to swim out to her, putting myself at risk.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people think spotted meghan markle","story":"NewsPeople think they spotted Meghan Markle saying \u0027f***\u0027 during the royal wedding carriage rideEagle-eyed viewers think they spotted the new Duke of Sussex having a rather naughty moment\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseySocial Audience Writer17:16, 19 MAY 2018Updated18:55, 19 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMillions of people around the world tuned in to watch Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle . Harry is obviously used to huge royal occasions, having attended them all his life, but this was Meghan\u0027s first one. Obviously she\u0027s been in the spotlight since the couple announced they were dating, but it seems she still needs to remember the cameras are on her at EVERY second. Eagle-eyed fans believe they spotted the new Duchess of Sussex saying f*** to her new husband. Oops.  After the couple said their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel they took a carriage ride around the town to wave to well-wishers, and people claim the naughty slip up happened while they were pulling back into the castle. Eagle-eyed fans took to social media to voice their shock, but most people were loving her naughty moment and saying it\u0027s probably exactly what they would say in that situation.  Before they got into the carriage Harry and Meghan shared a kiss on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel and posed for photos with the rest of the royal family behind them.  When they returned to the castle the attended the first of two receptions, which is being hosted by the Queen. Later on they will go to a reception hosted and paid for by Prince Charles at Frogmore House. Meghan\u0027s wedding dress is a stunning pure white gown by British designer Claire Waight Keller. She has a long train decorated with flowers from each of the 53 countries in the commonwealth.

The ginger prince is working a lot of facial hair at the moment, and many people wanted him to get rid of it all ahead of the big day. However the groom wasn\u0027t having any of it and decided to keep it as it is. People on social media have slammed his decision, saying he isn\u0027t allowed to have it while dressed in an Army uniform. But they\u0027re wrong.  As he is no longer a serving officer, Harry doesn\u0027t have to comply with the regulations. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: “Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform.” It is understood that the permission covered the fact that Harry has a beard. Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry has retired from active service.  The beard also caused a big row in November when he wore a full beard with a uniform of a senior Blues and Royals officer uniform at the Remembrance Day service. British Army rules forbid all beards, except in a few rare circumstances, such as when a soldier is suffering from a skin complaint, or has strong religious reasons for retaining facial hair.          Sikhs are not allowed to cut their own hair, and can thus retain their beards while in uniform, for example. Special Forces or others on covert operations are also permitted to grow beards when behind enemy lines, but they would not wear them on parade. There is also a tradition that allows a very small number of Pioneer Sergeants to wear a beard when on official duty, but members of the Queen’s personal guard have never been allowed to do so    The Queen , Harry’s grandmother, is Colonel-in-Chief of the Blues and Royals, while the Colonel of the Regiment is Princess Anne, his aunt. It is one of the two cavalry regiments of the Household Cavalry – the other is the Life Guards – and can trace its history back to Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army of the 17th Century. Throughout the centuries, officers have been known for their clean-cut appearances, although some occasionally grew moustaches and connected side-whiskers, especially when serving in Muslim countries. The Royal Navy – in which Harry ’s father, Prince Charles, served – has always been allowed beards, but officers are told to shave them off it they are not full enough.

Royal fans immediately took to Twitter to comment on her regretful face. It looks like she\u0027s about to cry, one viewer wrote on social media.

It is every inch befitting of the Duchess of Sussex – pure, simple and elegant, with a mix of traditional and contemporary features. She kept covered with three-quarter length sleeves for a modern modesty. The boatneck is also very classic. But it is the lack of embellishments that give it that high-fashion impact and really make a statement.  At any royal wedding , the surroundings are going to be ornate.  So you do not want too much fuss in the dress.  But what many people don’t realise is that a dress that’s simple is often harder to make than something with lots of tulle – because it has to fit so perfectly. The simple shape of it works well, it drapes beautifully. That magnificent five metre veil is what adds the drama.  The work that would have gone into that would have been extraordinary. I thought the hand-embroidered flowers in her headpiece, from the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, were a lovely touch.  British designer Clare Waight Keller – Givenchy’s creative director – did a stunning job. Givenchy was the go-to designer for the late Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn. And you can see it is slightly reminiscent of Hepburn’s style.  When I made Diana’s dress it was very much of her time. When you see it, you know immediately it’s the Eighties – that era of romance, drama and theatrics.  In contrast, Kate Middleton’s and now Meghan’s dresses have been very different. They are timeless – you wouldn’t be able to date them. Meghan’s is a dress that will be remembered for decades to come and perfectly reflects the future monarchy.

Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and their wedding guests. By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  Meghan smiled throughout as Harry looked on intently. At the end of the sermon, Harry Harry had just one word to say. He turned to Meghan to his left and simply said: Wow. Harry\u0027s brother Prince William could be seen on TV smiling during the lengthy address. Some commentators took to Twitter to point out the facial reactions in the chapel to the Bishop\u0027s sermon. In particular, a close-up of the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Zara, with her mouth open became a focus for social media. Meanwhile Harry\u0027s cousin Princess Beatrice was spotted giggling.  As the bishop got into full swing, Sky News journalist Mark Austin said: Lovely moment as the preacher takes the Royals to the edge of their comfort zone  BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said: The preacher is doing 50 in a 30 zone and it\u0027s brilliant. Bishop Curry, 65, is the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church. Bishop Curry is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, - but today he went global. Giving an address titled the Power of Love at the service, the Chicago native opened his energetic speech with the words of Martin Luther King, a devout Christian whose faith shaped his struggle against racial injustice in the US, hailing his views on love as right. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.      US ABC News anchor T.J. Holmes said: I\u0027m from West Memphis ... and my wedding wasn\u0027t even this black. I\u0027ve learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says I\u0027m wrapping up ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr. Curry. I\u0027m loving this. Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson said: SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN HIS OWN TV SHOW IMMEDIATELY.  Pop star Danni Minogue said: Windsor is waiting. Piers Morgan tweeted: OK, Rev... you need to wrap. One royal reporter noted: This is brilliant from Bishop Curry - some amazing facial expressions all around! Ed Miliband tweeted: Rev Michael Curry could almost make me a believer.      Princess Beatrice and Eugenie were both also seen smiling. There were more laughs when he asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around. The Mirror reported last week how Bishop Curry is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days after the wedding today. Bishop Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership.     The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry has also previously blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.     His invitation came months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Described as a stunning preacher by Archbishop Justin Welby the 65-year-old certainly grabs your attention. The bishop, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. In his autobiography he revealed his parents were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.   He was ordained as a deacon in June 1978. He became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2015. The Episcopal bishop\u0027s role in the service today was seen as a nod to the actress\u0027s US roots as she married into the British royal family.  Meghan was born in Los Angeles, California, to an African-American mother and was baptised into the Anglican Church ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. The bishop\u0027s words rose in a passionate crescendo as he spoke of the link between love and the divine, his style a stark contrast to the sober delivery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was officiating.For the royal family, the animated performance would be a departure from the type of sermons they normally see at church services.  The wide-ranging address cited love as the key to curing global problems such as poverty. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. In a moment of light self-deprecation, Bishop Curry noted he had to soon sit down, gesturing to the couple and adding we need to get y\u0027all married. The ideas of French thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin were called upon as the bishop brought his address to a powerful conclusion.

At a staggering \u0026pound3BILLION, the combined wealth on display as Harry and Meghan exchanged vows was bigger than the national debt of some countries. The Queen sang hymns with famous faces from the world of cinema, television and sport in an unprecedented gathering of stars and royals in one church. The extraordinary line-up saw David Beckham, 43, seated next to Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames – Winston Churchill’s grandson. US TV superstar Oprah Winfrey – who is worth \u0026pound1billion alone and is a close friend of Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland – was among the first to arrive before taking her seat near the front of St George’s chapel.  British actor Idris Elba, 45, who shot to fame in gritty US drama The Wire, was joined by his fianc\u0026eacutee Sabrina Dhowre, 29. Idris followed Oprah, 64, into the grounds and was later seen hugging James Corden, 39, another successful British telly export. As guests waited for the bride and groom to arrive, excitement swept the chapel when showbiz royalty George, 57, and Amal Clooney, 40 – who are worth \u0026pound375million – entered the Gothic building. Becks’ wife Victoria, 44, was dressed in a dark ensemble similar to the one she wore to William and Kate’s wedding.  And the surly fashion designer actually smiled as she hugged Nick Jones, 54, boss of Soho House, whose wife Kirsty Young, 49, was hosting the BBC’s coverage. Meghan and Harry enjoyed some of their first dates at the exclusive members-only club, and Meghan had her hen party at Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds. The group chatted as more stars – including singer Marcus Mumford, 31, and actress Carey Mulligan, 32 – took their seats.  Sir Elton John, 71, who famously performed at Diana’s funeral, sported pink-framed glasses as he made an entrance with husband David Furnish, 55. They were later seen talking to the Beckhams and James Blunt, 44, and his wife Sofia Wellesley, 34. Harry is a huge fan of singer James, who is also ex-Forces. Blunt performed at Harry’s Invictus Games in 2016.  Tennis ace Serena Williams, 36, was there to support her friend Meghan on her big day. She had given Meghan advice on walking down the aisle by herself. Like Meghan, Serena’s father was not by her side on her wedding day in November. The former world No1 this week revealed how dad Richard told her by text just an hour before her ceremony that he was “too nervous” to escort her down the aisle when she married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, 35.  Retired rugby player Mike Tindall, 39, was seen tenderly rubbing wife Zara Phillips’ baby bump. Also in attendance was Joss Stone, who has been friends with Harry and William for years. The singer, 31, is an ambassador for Sentebale, the charity founded by Prince Harry in Lesotho. Meanwhile actor Tom Hardy, 40, looked stony-faced throughout the chapel service, with his actress wife Charlotte Riley, 36, by his side. Charlotte played Kate Middleton in BBC2 drama King Charles III. Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra, 35, is one of Meghan’s closest friends.

Meghan Markle lookalike Sarah Mhlanga was among 1,200 guests from the public invited to watch the nuptials from within Windsor Castle’s walls. Many did a doubletake when they saw her standing with them in the courtyard instead of beside Harry inside the church – and even more people spotted her after the happy couple had tied the knot. Sarah, 36, said: “Loads of tourists stopped me saying how much I look like Meghan. I just thanked them and laughed.  “It took about three hours to get out of Windsor with everyone stopping me for photos. It’s funny to be recognised.” Sarah, of Manchester, was at the wedding with her charity worker mum Debra Green OBE, and admitted the moving ceremony reduced her to tears. She said: “I was crying when they gave their vows.  She added: “It was lovely hearing her voice. She was so softly spoken. I might try to master her speech in future as a Meghan lookalike.” Sarah expects to have some time off now the wedding is over, but predicts it might not be for long. She said: “Things could go quiet now Meghan’s married but maybe it’ll get busy again – when she has a baby.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding moments you might","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding moments you might have missed - from subtle side-eye and swearing to giggling guestsWhile all eyes were on the happy couple, the dress and that kiss, you might have missed what was going on behind them\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNatalie EvansSophie McCoid01:06, 20 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The wedding of the year went off without a hitch and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are now husband and wife.

Let\u0027s take you through them with our sister paper, the Birmingham Mail ...  The British dress stole the show  Meghan looked amazing in a demure gown. And it was designed by acclaimed designer, Clare Waight Keller - who hails from Birmingham. Ms Waight Keller last year became the first female artistic director at the historic French fashion house Givenchy.  The palace said: “Ms Markle expressed the wish of having all 53 countries of the Commonwealth with her on her journey through the ceremony. Ms Waight Keller designed a veil representing the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country united in one spectacular floral composition.” But while the world was watching here\u0027s some things you might have missed in all the excitement. David Beckham laughing - and Victoria not   David couldn\u0027t hold back a smile during the Royal Wedding address by Bishop Michael Curry.  But Victoria looked less than impressed as she failed to raise a smile for the nuptials, the Liverpool Echo reports . The Pageboys carrying the veil  Meghan had ten pageboys and bridesmaids and they did a sterling job during the wedding. Twin boys Master Brian Mulroney and Master John Mulroney both aged seven, did a great job of carrying Meghan\u0027s huge train. Princess Charlotte nailing the Royal Wave  Princess Charlotte is great at wooing the crowds and today was no exception as she carried out her Royal Wave with aplomb. The Princess stole the show when she went to see her newborn baby brother as she waved to photographers and the assembled crowd.  The three-year-old again delighted the crowds with her little wave. Amazing side-eye  The Royal family struggled to keep it together during the Bishop\u0027s unconventional sermon. Zara Phillips reaction was particularly hilarious, with her incredible side-eye.     The Choir singing stand by me The Choir singing Stand By Me was a real highlight of the wedding, with the crowd outside the chapel joining in the singing. The Kingdom Choir led by Karen Gibson performed Stand By Me—the 1961 classic by Ben E. King.   The choir\u0027s rendition caused goosebumps and was a modern addition to the Royal Wedding. Prince Philip looking well  Prince Philip\u0027s attendance at the Royal Wedding was in doubt as he recovers from a hip operation.

She cut a solitary figure as Meghan’s only family member at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. Sitting on pews centuries old, where kings and queens went before, the enormity of her daughter’s new role as a royal was visible on her face. Thrust into the limelight in recent weeks as drama surrounded other members of Meghan’s family, Doria was today peerless as the last – and only – relative standing. It is hard to imagine the pressure and overwhelming impact of such a momentous occasion. Yet her \u0026shypresence was quiet and dignified. She smiled beside her daughter as they arrived by royal limo.  Then Doria took her place in the chapel and, once Meghan entered to gasps of admiration, she visibly relaxed. And, just like Princess Diana so often showed the world, love and pride was written across Doria\u0027s face. The controversial circumstances surrounding her family situation and her ex-husband Thomas, 70, who missed the wedding on health grounds seemed to be all forgotten. And Doria’s new family – the Windsors – was on hand to help put her at ease. The 62-year-old yoga teacher took her front row seat alone, yet she was warmly welcomed into the royal fold by Prince Charles – her daughter’s new father-in-law. Royal watchers spoke of heartwarming scenes as Charles took Doria’s hand when they left their seats to join the newlyweds for the signing of the register.  And on leaving the chapel he offered her an arm of support as they faced the world’s media and cheering crowds. Doria was on Charles’s right arm and his wife, Duchess of Cornwall Camilla, was on the other. Charles looked tickled and a smile broke across Doria’s face. Then the trio posed for photographs alongside Prince William and his wife Kate – and the Queen herself. Doria seemed to enjoy every moment after shedding tears earlier when, understandably, the royal occasion caught up with her. Dressed in green coat and matching dress by Oscar De La Renta, Doria was a picture of pride, taking every opportunity to gaze adoringly at her daughter. And Meghan looked back with equal love. Their bond mirrors the incredible warmth Harry and his brother William shared with mum Diana. The princess, killed in a car crash in 1997, would have been every bit as proud as Doria had she been able to share this special day. But she was not forgotten. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet – handpicked from Kensington Palace gardens – to the music and readings, the couple ensured that Diana’s presence was felt.  In one moving tribute they chose a Bible reading about the power of eternal love, read by Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes. Lady Jane, 61, triggered tears among the 600 guests as she quoted from the eighth chapter of the Song of Solomon. She read: “My beloved speaks and says to me: ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” Lady Jane was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s cousins in the Spencer family. Also present in the congregation was former Prime Minister Sir John Major, who was appointed special  to Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters when their mother died. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, but Sir John’s presence was a reminder of a pivotal role that he played in Harry’s life at a difficult time. Earlier, when Meghan arrived at the West Steps of St George’s Chapel at midday, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s favourite flowers.  Nestled among blooms picked at Kensington and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets, were the distinctive white petals of forget-me-nots, the late princess’s most-loved flower. And adorning the walls of the historic chapel were arches of flowers including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were poignantly planted in her memory at Kensington Palace over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry would have been particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn. He and Meghan chose Guide Me O Thy Great Redeemer – which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it in their wedding. The poignant touches were important to Harry, who was just 12 when his mother died. In heartbreaking images, he and William walked behind their mother’s coffin at her State funeral in September 1997. Today the princes shared memories of their mother as they waited for Meghan to arrive at the chapel.  When Harry spotted a tearful Doria before the ceremony began he looked across to try to catch her eye in a supportive gesture. Doria sat with her daughter’s closest friends – Jessica Mulroney and Heather Dorak. She had accompanied Meghan to the chapel after spending Friday night together at nearby Cliveden House, in Taplow, Berks. There had been suggestions that Doria might have taken on the \u0026shyresponsibility of walking her daughter down the aisle after her ex-husband Thomas was admitted to hospital earlier this week for heart surgery. Thomas did watch the wedding on TV and he told celebrity news website TMZ: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish them all my love and all happiness.” In his absence today, Charles stepped up to walk Meghan down the last part of her journey down the aisle. And as the pictures of Charles and Doria on the chapel steps showed, while they come from very different worlds, they bonded over a love for their children which is the same the whole world over. By Nicola Small and Victoria Murphy Harry and Meghan made sure Princess Diana was not forgotten on their special day. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet to the music and the reading at the service, the couple ensured her presence was felt – 21 years after her crash death. The only reading was about the power of eternal love, with Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, 61, triggering tears as she said from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins. Also present was former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed special  to Princes Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters, when Diana died in the Paris underpass. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, so Mr Major’s presence was a reminder of the pivotal role he played in Harry’s life at a traumatic time. When Meghan arrived at St George’s Chapel, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s beloved forget-me-nots. The white petals of Diana’s favourite nestled among blooms picked from Kensington Palace gardens and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets. Adorning the walls of the 500-year-old chapel were arches of flowers, including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were planted in her memory at the palace gardens over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry was emotional throughout the service and was particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn, Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it their wedding. Given pride of place in the chapel was Diana’s close friend Julia Samuel, with her husband Michael. Julia is godmother to Prince George and has remained close to William and Harry following Diana’s death, with Meghan previously talking about how much she enjoyed meeting her."},{"url":null,"title":"spare seat princess diana harry","story":"NewsSpare seat for Princess Diana?

As Meghan Markle met her prince at the altar, cameras showed Prince Charles, Camilla and Kate looking up at the happy couple. And in front of the Queen - next to Harry\u0027s big brother - was an empty spot. Royal fans said the sentimental move left them tearful and thinking of the late princess. There was also speculation the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did the same at their wedding in 2011. But according to Buckingham Palace sources, the spot in front of the Queen is always left empty.  If it\u0027s true, what a lovely idea, one person wrote on Twitter. Di will be looking down at her son feeling nothing but pride. I can\u0027t stop crying, another wrote. Such a moving day already - and now this. Harry and Meghan also had a floral tribute to Princess Diana at the wedding.    St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, was adorned with floral displays of foliage, white peonies, white garden roses and other white blooms, which towered above the seats. White garden flowers were a favourite of Harry\u0027s late mum. And forget-me-nots, another favourite, were used in the bridal bouquet.      Sir Elton John also performed at Harry and Meghan\u0027s lunchtime wedding reception. The singer has a close relationship with Harry and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and was friends with the Princess of Wales. In 1997, he famously sang a re-worked version of his hit Candle In The Wind at the princess\u0027s funeral, changing the words to Goodbye England\u0027s Rose.    In a TV interview in June, 2008, he told how singing at the funeral was a surreal experience. He said: What was going through my mind was, \u0027Don\u0027t f*** this up. Don\u0027t sing a wrong note. Don\u0027t sing the wrong note. Be stoic. Don\u0027t break down and just do it to the best you can possibly do it without showing any emotion whatsoever\u0027.  The singer was also present at William\u0027s wedding to the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Meghan and Harry sealed their love with a kiss after being declared husband and wife this afternoon. The bride arrived at church in a wedding dress designed by Clare Waight Keller , which was set off by a veil made to represent all 53 countries of the Commonwealth. Harry arrived at St George\u0027s chapel at Windsor Castle a short while before Meghan alongside best man Prince William.  The couple kissed after the ceremony finished before getting into a royal horse-drawn carriage for a 30-minute procession as thousands of fans lined the streets . They are now back inside Windsor Castle for a reception where Meghan, Harry and Prince Charles will all make speeches. Global superstars including Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, David Beckham and George Clooney were there to watch the wedding, as well as the Queen and Prince Philip. The couple were this morning made the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the Queen in a wedding day honour.

Becky Gendall suffered horrendous injuries when she jumped 60ft off a car park to end the anguish of a teenage battle with anorexia and anxiety. She shattered bones all over her body but was pieced back together by surgeons in 21 ops. As she lay for weeks on end in hospital, the nurses became her best friends. And now she has recovered she is training to become a nurse herself – on a placement at the hospital which saved her. Becky, now 20, says: “I wanted to end my life but now I feel so lucky to be alive. If I can help look after others the way they looked after me, I will be happy.”  Becky has bravely decided to tell her incredible story in a bid to help other youngsters with mental health problems. She was a talented competitive ice skater when her problems began while still at school. Desperate to keep her weight down, she plunged into a spiral of eating less and less until she was living on just 400 calories a day – a fifth of the recommended intake. Finally in May 2014, at the age of 16, she reached breaking point from the torture of her advancing eating disorder. She left the home she shared with her parents and little sister in \u0026shyBracknell, Berkshire, travelled to the town centre and hurled herself off the top of a car park. Horrified high street shoppers saw her plunge to the pavement, landing with such force she broke bones in her jaw, elbow, legs, feet, ribs, ankles, spine, pelvis and suffered serious internal bleeding.  She was airlifted 50 miles to University Hospital Southampton in critical condition. Doctors and nurses fought to save her life with repeated blood transfusions. She was then put in a coma for over a week as her injuries were treated. The gifted young athlete’s body was so badly smashed that dozens of metal bolts, screws and plates were needed to piece it back together. Becky’s car park leap came at the peak of her mental illness yet it also marked a turning point in her journey back to health. A year earlier she had tried to kill herself with an overdose at school, after which her eating disorder was uncovered. She was given weekly cognitive behavioural therapy and weigh-ins to track her weight, which fell to just 7st.  But as well as spurning food she hit the gym several times a day, making her even thinner and isolating her from her parents, who we have agreed not to name. She says: “It felt like I wasn’t underweight enough to get the proper care I needed. “I’d been suffering anorexia and depression for two years when I developed anxiety. It all got too much to cope with and I wanted it all to end.” Becky spent eight weeks in hospital, mostly bedbound. She recalls: “It was very lonely. I wasn’t always well enough to have visitors and when I was visiting hours were limited. “The nurses became my best friends. Sometimes their shifts had finished but they would sit with me for hours until my painkillers kicked in or I fell asleep. They were angels. “Seeing how nurses can make all the difference to a child’s life on the ward was eye-opening. “Hospitals are frightening places for children and when you couple that with pain or feeling unwell and being apart from your family, the nurses’ role becomes even more important.” Though Becky has now recovered enough to train as a paediatric nursing student, she has lasting reminders of her ordeal.  Repairs to her jaw, which was fractured in two places, have altered her face and her right foot is fixed, making skating and dancing difficult. Becky says: “My face doesn’t look the same as it did and finding shoes and heels to wear is harder, but I’m lucky to be alive so it’s a small price to pay.” While in hospital she was visited by the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) team but there was no dedicated space for their appointments. She recalls: “I was talking about why I’d tried to end my life while sat in a communal kitchen with visitors popping in to make tea. “It wasn’t the mental health team’s fault, that’s just how limited the provisions are. But they were still a huge support.” Doctors also encouraged her to eat properly again and she credits golden retriever Leo, a specially trained Pets As Therapy dog, for giving her a boost. Leo cheered her up every week when he visited the children’s ward with his handler, volunteer Lyndsey Uglow.  Becky says: “I’d always wanted a puppy so having Leo pop in was great. Sometimes he gave me cuddles, other times he distracted me when the pain was too much.” Becky, who is now in the second year of her nursing degree, has become a vocal advocate of mental health support for teenagers with eating disorders. Research shows early intervention is the key for helping children recover from mental health problems, yet the NHS spends just 0.7 per cent of its budget in this area. Three in four children with a diagnosable condition do not get access to the support they need, and those who do have to wait 10 months on average. Tom Madders of mental health charity YoungMinds said: “Every day we get calls from parents who don’t know where to turn.” What she broke When Becky plunged to the pavement off a high street car park she landed with such force she was left with devastating injuries. She shattered bones in her jaw, elbow, legs, feet, ribs, ankles, spine, pelvis and suffered terrible internal bleeding. She was put in a coma and spent weeks in hospital.

Meghan\u0027s delicate accessory, made from silk tulle with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers, was safely carried up the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, by two young pageboys. But on leaving the chapel, the elegant veil appeared to catch on a wooden panel, prompting a quick-thinking guest to step in. Meghan quickly composed herself before emerging into the sunlight with Prince Harry on her arm. The bride wore a simple, pure white gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, with three quarter length sleeves and open bateau neckline.  Harry told his bride You look amazing. I missed you when she met him at the altar. After the service, they kissed in front of a delighted crowd. The couple tenderly held hands and exchanged smiles during the wedding ceremony. Meghan\u0027s hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen. It was described as one of life\u0027s great moments as guests watched Prince Harry tie the knot with Meghan today. But it was not without its hiccups.    The excitement of the royal wedding became too much for one bridesmaid, who started crying moments before Meghan entered the chapel. The occasion seemed to overwhelm one of the little girls, believed to be the youngest, Zalie Warren. The two-year-old had to be picked up and comforted by Prince George and Princess Charlotte\u0027s nanny before she made her way into the church.

A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “From this weekend and throughout next week, temperatures will be above normal across much of Europe. “This is due to an area of high pressure becoming dominant. “Forecast models indicate that above normal temperatures are likely to persist for the rest of May.” The Met Office forecasts that most places will stay dry and warm this week, but there could be isolated thundery showers across England and Wales.

Veronica German has spoken about her experience of being among the royals and famous names like George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham and Oprah Winfrey. The charity director from Wales was one of the guests who was invited to the service at St George\u0027s Chapel and the drinks reception that followed it. Veronica, who runs Dolen Cymru, said some of her highlights were chatting to Meghan\u0027s former co-stars of TV drama Suits and hearing Sir Elton John performing at the drinks reception following the service.  She told Wales Online how she grabbed a chat with Meghan\u0027s former on screen husband in the series, Patrick J Adams.  I asked him if he was really upset that she\u0027s married someone else and he said, \u0027How can I be upset when I just got to listen to Elton John. He made my day\u0027.   Prince Harry has been the patron of Dolen Cymru, which builds links between Wales and Lesotho, since 2007 and Veronica received the invitation through her work.  It was like being at a family wedding really, she said. It was quite normal in some respects with some nice music and it was lovely singing Cwm Rhondda. And then we went to the reception and there was Elton John singing Your Song. The mother of three, who lives in Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbran, set her alarm for 4.30am to leave the house an hour later for the drive to Windsor. She was driven by her husband Mike German, a former AM and member of the House of Lords - but she didn\u0027t receive a plus one so he waited in the car with a picnic.   So how does being a royal wedding guest actually work out?  After stopping at Reading Service Station to do her make up, they made it to the designated car park outside Windsor on time where guests had to wait in a holding room. Then they were bussed to the chapel more than an hour before the service was due to begin at noon - with toilet facilities only available until 11am. We walked past the crowds into the chapel and I recognised quite a few people, said Veronica. You could sit anywhere you wanted in the chapel and I was next to James Blunt and his wife. We just had a normal chat. Veronica even caught a glimpse of Harry and William.  She said: I couldn\u0027t really see the royal family as they came in through a different door to us but we saw William and Harry - and Harry looked a bit nervous. Meghan looked beautiful - when she arrived I just thought how much smaller she was than I thought she would be and her dress was so white with a lovely, lovely long veil. She looked like she was really enjoying herself. And the little bridesmaids were just hysterical - they kept looking all over the place. Meghan walked up the aisle as Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas sung George Frideric Handel\u0027s Eternal Source of Light Divine. She sounded amazing, said Veronica. She really did Wales proud. One of her favourite parts of the service was the sermon by Bishop Michael Curry.  He was incredible - he was so genuine, so real. Following the service, the guests walked to St George\u0027s Hall for the drinks reception. Veronica told: The crowds were cheering when we walked out. We missed the carriage with the bride and groom but there were lots of people still there. While Veronica didn\u0027t meet the royals, she mingled with many famous names at the reception and listened as Elton John sang a few tracks, including Your Song. Both the groom and the Prince of Wales gave speeches during the reception. Prince Charles said it was a very emotional time for him seeing his youngest child getting married and every time Harry said \u0027my wife\u0027 everyone cheered.

This mighty brood – “unique” according to a fertility expert – left Julie and Lance Erickson feeling they’d really hit the jackpot. They spent years trying for kids and umpteen rounds of IVF failed. Then they won a draw in which the prize was a course of fertility treatment – and this time it worked. Doctors produced 10 viable embryos, implanted two in Julie and froze the rest for future use. Now the couple have seven kids. They are quite a handful and quite a mouthful – there’s Kaitlyn, Caleb, Cody, Chelsea, Kelsey, Caden and Colton. Fertility expert Rob Smith, clinic director at CARE London, said: ‘‘This is an amazing story.  “At CARE fertility we have had many babies born following one initial round of fertility treatment – each subsequent baby being born separately using a frozen embryo. “However, seven babies, conceptually septuplets from a single IVF cycle, is surely a unique event.” Julie and Lance had almost given up on having kids when they won the prize draw. The 10 embryos were all conceived in a laboratory at the same time in 2007. And their prize family includes THREE sets of twins. Julie, 40, said: “When we won the raffle, I think I just went into shock. Lance started sobbing. I was so happy. I felt it was a gift from God.” Kaitlyn, now nine, was the first born, in July 2008. The rest of the embryos remained in the clinic’s freezer and were taken out in twos as the couple underwent more fertility treatment over the years. Julie went on to have identical twins Caleb and Cody, six, and twins Chelsea and Kelsey, four. The youngest set are Caden and Colton, who will be one on May 31. The couple married in 2001 and waited a couple of years before trying for a family. But each month brought heartbreak as pregnancy tests showed “negative”.  Julie, from Minnesota, U.S., said: “It was one of the worst times of my life. Many people don’t understand how hard it is. “Going to other people’s baby showers and even going to church on Mother’s Day was very difficult during those years.” Eventually they decided to try IVF... but the first cycle failed. They had a further three rounds of treatment costing thousands of dollars – and each one brought disappointment. Doctors feared Julie’s immune system was going into overdrive and rejecting the embryos in her womb. Then a local fertility clinic hosted a Family Building Conference which put on a raffle with free IVF as the prize. The Ericksons attended the open day and entered the draw. By then, Julie feared that her dream of having a child would never come to reality. She admitted: “Sometimes I did start to lose hope. “It was an emotional rollercoaster and I doubted that I would ever be a mother.” But to their surprise and delight, the couple won the raffle and wasted no time in starting IVF. Julie had two embryos planted into her womb, with a further eight being stored in deep freeze.  But this time medics also suppressed her immune system to stop her body rejecting the embryos and give them a fighting chance of thriving. Julie added: “We had two embryos put back, but only one carried on growing. We were sad at the first scan that we could only see one heart beating, but we were so thankful for that one heart. It was beating so strongly. “It was surreal when Kaitlyn was born. It was amazing to be holding our baby in our arms after five years of trying.” Three years later, in 2011, the \u0026shyEricksons were ready to add to their family and Julie had two more embryos implanted. One failed and the second divided into two – producing healthy twins Cody and Caleb. And in 2014, doctors defrosted another two of the original 10 embryos and implanted those. Julie fell pregnant and had twins Chelsea and Kelsey. She went on: “Every time I find out I’m having twins I’m happily excited. But it’s definitely challenging. I’m not going to lie – it’s hard work. But it’s worth it.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to change.”A council spokeswoman said: “We understand that being homeless is difficult and traumatic and our aim is to offer a service that is sympathetic as well as meeting our statutory duties.“When we

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community.

It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fans rush to buy new    Only the Bold    home kit ahead of Scottish Cup final","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS new 2018/19 home kit has hit stores - and supporters can\u0026rsquot get enough of it ahead of the big Scottish Cup final on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"Neil Lennon  Tom Rogic signing shows Celtic mean business","story":"                          Neil Lennon believes the new deal signed by \u0026ldquoiconic Tom Rogic shows that Celtic mean business as the Parkhead club look to make Scottish football history tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"New footbridge is a link across the River Clyde","story":"                          A 130 metre lifted the five giant beams making up the base of Polmadie Bridge."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7362756.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Justin Timberlake CANCELS one Glasgow show and reschedules another","story":"                          MUSIC star Justin Timberlake has cancelled one of his upcoming Glasgow shows."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7777769.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Football on TV  Where to watch Celtic v Motherwell  Chelsea v Manchester United and more","story":"                          THE time has almost come for Celtic and Motherwell to do battle for the final major honour in Scotland this season."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow animal charity seeking new homes for four very unusual puppies","story":"                          The team at Dogs Trust Glasgow are appealing for homes for some of their quirkiest ever residents."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7807458.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Alex Salmond  Nicola Sturgeon    ready for BBC bias    in next Scottish independence referendum","story":"                          NICOLA Sturgeon will not underestimate the alleged bias of the BBC when the next independence referendum is called, Alex Salmond has said."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7810183.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Public consultation to open next week on   9m plans for Byres Road","story":"                          A PUBLIC consultation on design proposals for the future of Byres Road will begin next week.

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Sunday 20 May 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04097000/04097386.jpg","title":"Community buyout plans for castle","story":"\u0026nbspBOLD plans for a community buyout of Urquhart Castle visitor centre overlooking Loch Ness \u0026ndash which could generate millions of pounds for the local economy \u0026ndash will be discussed at a public meeting next week.The site, visited by almost half a million people last year, making it one of Scotland\u0027 most popular tourist attractions, is operated by the government agency Historic Environment Scotland (HES).But a community group believes the tourist attraction could generate much-needed funds for local projects ranging from road improvements to supporting a childcare centre if it was run by locals.It wants to explore the possibility of using community asset transfer legislation to acquire the visitor centre, car park and land along with the neighbouring tourist information centre and Loch Ness Homes parkland.The Glen Urquhart Rural Community Association (Gurca) is urging people to give their views at a meeting at Glenurquhart Public Hall, starting at 7.30pm next Tuesday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoch Ness tourism expert Willie Cameron, a spokesman for Gurca which includes community and business representatives, said there had been some initial meetings to discuss the idea.\"At this stage, it is a proposal,\" he said. \"No action is going to be taken until the meeting when we will find out the will of the people.\"If support was forthcoming, the next step would be to carry out a feasibility study but he believed Urquhart Castle had the potential to bring in revenue for infrastructure projects such as pothole repairs, improved footpaths and cycle ways, as well as supporting local facilities such as the day care centre and a childcare centre.\"We have a cash cow sitting on our doorstep but it seems not a penny is coming into the area,\" he said.\"We have potholes on the A82.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
