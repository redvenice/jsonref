In 1987, she served as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation for the state of Maine and later as the New England regional director of the Small Business Administration in 1992.After relocating to Massachusetts to serve as the state’s Deputy State Treasurer in 1993, she returned to her native Maine in 1994 to launch a gubernatorial bid for the state’s governorship, becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of Governor of Maine.However, she ultimately lost the election to Angus King, who would later serve alongside her in the United States Senate.After working in the private sector, Collins again launched another political bid and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, formally taking her position as Senator the following year.          Brett Kavanaugh, above, faces an extremely close confirmation battle ahead in the U.S. SenateA moderate Republican, she was reelected in 2002, 2008 and 2014. In the Senate, Collins has played a key role on many issues and chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee from 2003 to 2007.In the 2016 election, she stated that should would not support the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican standard bearer and has had a mixed record on supporting Trump after his surprise election victory, voting in favor of his proposed tax cuts in December 2017 but also opposing the President’s controversial temporary ban on travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and his family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border.Collins has also emerged as a key swing vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, being set to unveil her final decision on October 5 ahead of the final vote in the U.S. Senate.How old is Susan Collins?Susan Collins is 65 years old.She was born on December 7, 1952.          Collins has served in the Senate since 1997 and considered a leading moderate voice thereWho is Susan Collins’s husband?Susan Collins’s husband is Thomas Daffron.The couple has been married since 2012.What is Susan Collins’s net worth?According to Open Secrets, Collins’s net worth is believed to be about $3.7 million (£2.8m).She is believed to draw her wealth from both her years of government service and through various financial investments.Susan Collins vote on KavanaughIn the lead-up to the final vote on the controversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican Senator has emerged as a critical swing vote who could ultimately decide the balance of the highest court in the United States for decades to come.Collins, who has not yet publicly decided whether she’ll vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, has revealed that she’ll announce her decision at 3pm EST on Friday, October 5.          Senator Susan Collins will soon reveal how she intends to vote 3pm EST on Friday, October 5During a procedural vote on the morning of October 5, Collins joined other swing vote Senators like Jeff Flake and Democrat Joe Manchin in advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final floor vote on October 6. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican known for bucking her party, voted against advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination.Despite voting in favor of the procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh, Collins is still undecided – at least publicly – as to whether she’ll ultimately vote to confirm him, creating much uncertainty as to whether the Supreme Court nominee has enough votes to ultimately be confirmed as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.The Republicans’ narrow Senate majority means that they can only afford to lose one vote if all Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence casts the tiebreaking vote in Kavanaugh’s favor.In addition to Collins, Senators Flake, Murkowski and Manchin have not yet publicly announced how they will vote on the planned final floor vote on Saturday, October 6.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

Geologists determined the hole was made by animalsInvestigators added they found no sign of methane at the source.  No utility or fuel lines in the area were determined to be leaking, Pendergrass added. No one was able to take photo or video of the fire which broke out at 4.30am. A landscaper says that the hole was there for about 10 years but never unleashed an inferno before.\u0027It\u0027s kind of like an old groundhog hole, burrow, or armadillo\u0027s.

Pictured: Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly on the show on November 2Before adding of any negative comments about the segment, she said: \u0027All I\u0027m going to say is that I feel very strongly about the #MeToo coverage, the importance of doing it without fear or favor.\u0027I didn\u0027t let anyone stop me at Fox, and I\u0027m not going to let anyone stop me at NBC.\u0027But the 47-year-old doesn\u0027t believe that all men accused of harassment should have a blanket ban on returning to work.Kelly, who said she was harassed by former Fox boss Roger Ailes, explained: \u0027I feel it\u0027s a case-by-case basis.\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think we need to see Harvey Weinstein in polite society ever again, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true of everyone. I think, for some of these guys, there\u0027s a way forward. I happen to believe it starts with a full-throated apology, and not just this paper statement of, \u0027I did some things wrong and I\u0027m sorry.\u0027She said that women wanted to see, not just punishment, but that they had changed and grown. \u0027I think Americans are very forgiving, and I am very forgiving,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think these guys who want to completely skirt around it and just reappear and re-emerge in their old roles are kidding themselves,\u0027 she added. \u0027Women are feeling too empowered to allow that.           The former Fox anchor, pictured with Lauer in May last year, said she knew more than she could let on, telling US Weekly: \u0027I know too much that others don\u0027t know\u0027\u0027They don\u0027t want to just see punishment, they want to see that you get it. And the ones that we\u0027ve covered publicly had immense positions of power, so they absolutely should not be allowed to return to those until we understand there\u0027s been a sea change in their thinking and behavior.\u0027Meanwhile, Kelly has been focused on keeping her own job safe amid her show\u0027s tanking ratings, executives at NBC News tell DailyMailTV exclusively.The former Fox News host launched her much-hyped show Megyn Kelly Today last September after securing a three-year contract for a staggering $69 million.Despite NBC heavily promoting the 47-year-old\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and Ryan.Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, even covering her own colleagues at the network who had been accused or fired over allegations of sexual misconduct, most notably Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw. Multiple top executives at NBC tell DailyMailTV they believe she has strategically positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employer.              Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, NBC executives tell DailyMailTV, as a strategic plan in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employerA high-ranking source at NBC told DailyMailTV: \u0027Everyone has had enough and they want Megyn out. \u0027It\u0027s like she\u0027s the Manchurian candidate of NBC News - someone put inside the network to take it down from within.\u0027Her strategy is the talk of 30 Rock. As soon as her show became a dumpster fire she actively positioned it as the only place on network television that it is \u0027\u0027MeToo\u0027\u0027 continually.\u0027By aggressively reporting on every male accused of sexual misconduct at the network, it would make her much harder to fire. \u0027If NBC did fire her, she\u0027ll argue she was terminated for speaking up, when in fact she is an opportunist who latched on to an important movement when nothing else was working for her.\u0027Let\u0027s be frank - a woman determined to support other women wouldn\u0027t have launched her show by asking Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery.\u0027  NBC president Andy Lack, who has been accused of turning a blind eye towards sexual misconduct claims at the network, is said to be \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Megyn\u0027s attempts to turn her show into a forum for the movement, including her coverage of claims against Brokaw and Lauer. An NBC News spokesperson responded in a statement: \u0027None of this is true. NBC News is thrilled that Megyn is on our team and extremely proud of her work including her coverage of the #MeToo movement since her earliest days at the network. \u0027We are also very pleased with her 9am show, which is substantive, empowering and engaging.\u0027        Megyn has positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo, even covering her own colleagues at the network who have faced sexual misconduct claims, such as Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw               After Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone (pictured), who had an affair with Matt LauerAfter Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone. Zinone had a month-long affair with Lauer in 2000 when she was just a 24-year-old production assistant at Today.While Zinone said the relationship was consensual, she added that the power dynamics had made her later regret the relationship. Kelly\u0027s show hit its one year anniversary this month and she donned a little black dress and leopard heels, celebrating the milestone that many thought she wouldn\u0027t see, considering her disappointing ratings.ABC\u0027s rival show Live with Kelly and Ryan, starring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, has been trouncing Megyn\u0027s show, consistently beating her out in viewership. A top NBC brass added to DailyMailTV: \u0027The ratings show that when Megyn comes on, the audience leaves and switches over to Kelly and Ryan on ABC.\u0027Here is the highest paid on air personality actively tearing down the network at 9am every morning.  \u0027The anchors, producers and executives all share the same opinion - Megyn Kelly needs to leave NBC!\u0027 An NBC News spokesperson pointed to research that shows Megyn averaged 2.4 million viewers in September - the highest it has been since February.               Despite NBC backing Megyn\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers quickly changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and RyanFor Megyn\u0027s low ratings, her hefty salary of $23 million a year - $69 million over the course of three years - is seen as a \u0027mistake\u0027 by senior NBC executives. At the time of her deal, Lauer, who had been the network\u0027s shining star for more than a decade, was estimated to be earning $25 million a year - just $2 million more than Megyn, NBC\u0027s gamble on a newcomer.A network executive said to DailyMailTV: \u0027Her salary is also unfair - why should she be paid more than Savannah and Hoda combined. \u0027Two talented anchors who are loved by the audience and who viewers actively choose to watch. \u0027How is she worth more than Al Roker, Kathie Lee Gifford or Jimmy Fallon - all beloved household names that hold far greater star power at NBC and beyond.\u0027   Insiders say NBC has already mapped out a scenario for Kelly\u0027s exit where they could actually break even. By terminating her, NBC would be obligated to pay out the remainder of her contract. But they would be able to replace a very expensive hour of television with one that gets better ratings and is almost free to produce. NBC would immediately be able to replace Kelly in the 9am hour of Today by bringing back Al Roker to that hour, possibly combining him with Dylan Dreyer, a duo who executives expect will increase the 9am hour\u0027s ratings by 15-20 percent, thereby grow the hour\u0027s advertising revenue.More importantly, NBC would be able to bring the hour back to Studio 1A and drastically cut costs. Before Kelly arrived, NBC ran the 9am hour of Today at minimal expense, using the same studio and control room crew that produced Today\u0027s earlier hours and severely limiting costly taped pieces and food segments. Kelly\u0027s show, by contrast, is done in a separate studio and has a whole separate staff and spends lavishly on production. NBC could save even more money by terminating those staffers.And Megyn is dealing with chaos behind the scenes of her show, as earlier this year the morning program\u0027s head writer claimed it was a \u0027completely toxic\u0027 environment.        Megyn Kelly knows ‘too much that others don’t know’ about Matt Lauer - AOL Entertainment"},{"url":null,"title":"Waitrose delivery trial let drivers home out","story":"Waitrose is trialling a delivery service that gives drivers access to customers\u0027 homes to unpack groceries while they\u0027re out           The service called While You\u0027re Away allows a customer with a Yale smart lock to set a temporary access code which is then sent to Waitrose via a secure appThe supermarket believes it is the first in the UK to test demand for such a service – initially with 100 customers located near its fulfilment centre in Coulsdon, south London – after seeing it prove popular in the US and Scandinavia. There is a minimum order of £25 and, initially at least, a minimum of six deliveries, although Waitrose said it would review this after the trial.Waitrose said it anticipated being able to make the service available to more than 1,000 customers in spring next year depending on the success of the trial.Oops!

Everything from cash machines to home heating systems, from electricity generators to mobile phones and the health service relies on cyber technology. We have seen many times in recent years the enormous disruption caused by a temporary breakdown in service, as happened during the botched IT upgrade at the TSB bank.Similarly, 18 months ago the NHS was hit by a major cyber problem, prompting the mass cancellation of operations. Then the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un was cynical enough to take the blame and the fear inspired by that. But it is clear, from the wealth of mounting evidence, that the Russians certainly have the capability and determination to launch similar attacks.If patients’ lives were put at risk by such a cyber attack, it would create a real global panic – the cyber-equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.That is why we should be worried. What is happening now in cyberspace is even more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable than the darkest days of the Cold War.For all the anxieties back then about a nuclear stand-off, at least the hostility between the West and the Soviet Bloc was governed by respected boundaries. The rules – such as a prohibition on assassinations – were generally upheld. Both sides communicated with each other, partly from the need to avoid a nuclear apocalypse through a catastrophic misunderstanding.That culture has disappeared. We live in a much more fluid world where restrictions on movement – especially in Europe – hardly exist at all. At any given moment there are probably more than 100,000 Russians in Britain, most of them wholly innocent and here to work, study or enjoy a break. Yet that transient mass also provides cover for hostile intelligence agents.Moreover, technology makes it much easier for someone to cause mayhem. During the Cold War, if the Soviets wanted to hit a water pumping station or sabotage an aircraft, they had to send in armed agents. Today, that could be accomplished from an office in Moscow or Kiev – just as computer programs can churn out millions of emails to damage businesses, influence elections and propagate fake news.          Grainy surveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency          Pictures released at the briefing show the cache of equipment seized from the menThen there are the armies of hackers in ‘troll’ factories who spread destabilising information, such as Hillary Clinton’s emails or the details of Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ asthma prescriptions. The aim is to undermine public respect for Western politicians and heroes alike.The fall of the Berlin Wall almost three decades ago was a remarkable triumph for freedom and capitalism over totalitarianism. But that ascendancy lulled Western politicians into a false sense of security.Russia, which has an economy no bigger than that of Britain or France, is showing daily that if resources are focused on a certain area – in this case cyber warfare – then a nation can still have lethal power.And we are only just coming to terms with it. Yesterday Lord Ricketts, who served as Britain’s National Security Adviser until 2012, warned that the recent plots are just the start, ‘pilot projects’ to test defences in advance of a full-blooded cyber assault to bring anarchy to the West.          Russian president Vladimir Putin waves to spectators prior to boarding a car after his arrival in New Delhi as the GRU\u0027s campaign of cyber warfare against the west was today exposedAs president Putin’s invasion of Crimea and his support for the Assad regime in Syria has shown, he is not a man constrained by normal democratic values. Throughout his presidency he has been pushing at boundaries, seeing what he can get away with, what will provoke the West to act.Now his dwindling popularity at home over his domestic agenda – particularly his attempt to raise the retirement age – makes it all the more imperative for him to wrap himself in the nationalist flag with high-profile attacks on the West.At least the complacency in Europe and America is beginning to lift and we are starting to fight back – as highlighted by the unprecedented news conference yesterday in which the Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, and Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, explained how the OPCW conspiracy was foiled.In the context of cyber warfare, the West has unparalleled expertise. The staff of both the US National Security Agency and our own formidable base at GCHQ in Cheltenham have world-beating abilities in hacking computers and other electronic devices.So far the West has proved far more restrained than Russia in deploying that expertise. There is only one documented case of Western agents using a computer against an enemy state’s infrastructure. That occurred when the Israelis and the Americans worked together to release the Stuxnet virus into the computers that operated Iran’s nuclear programme. It proved what the West can do if necessary.But any escalation in cyber warfare is fraught with risk. A miscalculation by any rogue agents, anxious to ingratiate themselves with the Kremlin, could have disastrous consequences.We do well to remember that the new world disorder, which Putin promotes as well as relishes, is our new reality. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/06/03FF79520000044D-0-image-a-5_1538717892231.jpg","title":"Wallace Gromit creator Nick Park reveals named famous character Labrador","story":"    Wallace and Gromit has won Oscars for animator Nick Park who was inspired in his home town of Preston in Lancashite  Nick Park revealed Wallace was inspired by the looks of a postman and the name of a LabradorThe five-time BAFTA winner said he named Wallace after a dog  he met on a bus in the city.He told the Daily Mirror: \u0027I\u0027d come up with all sorts of names but they didn\u0027t fit the character.\u0027One day, though, I caught the Walmer Bridge to Preston bus and an old lady got on.Cheese, Gromit? Santa\u0027s sleigh, Mickey Mouse and a famous...Is that you in Plasticine, Mr Miliband?

They attempted to smash up some of the phones (inset) when they realised authorities were on to them  These images, made available by the Dutch Ministry of Defence today, are said to show the hacking equipment that four Russian intelligence officers used for a cyber attack on the OPCW        Loverboy Lexa, footballer \u0027Zhenya\u0027 and a baby-faced kingpin who used the alias \u0027Karen Millen\u0027: Putin\u0027s \u0027dumb Bonds\u0027 hacking squad unmaskedThey were supposed to be top spies, hidden from the world and operating behind a veil of secrecy.But after Dutch, British and US authorities blew the lid off Putin\u0027s ham-fisted hacking squad yesterday, the identities of the GRU\u0027s \u0027Unit 26165\u0027 can now be revealed.The gang include computer geeks - who advertised themselves on Moscow dating websites and played in the city\u0027s amateur football leagues .They served alongside more hardened members of the Kremlin\u0027s security apparatus, who organised and oversaw the group\u0027s many trips abroad and acted as the hackers\u0027 minders.              Alexei Morenets, 41, is an officer in Russia\u0027s GRU and believed to be one of its top hackers - but also responsible for most extraordinary blunder of The Hague mission.It appears that Morenets inadvertently outed more than 300 other agents working for the GRU in Moscow.Investigators have found he travelled on a diplomatic passport using his  real names and date of birth.News agency Bellingcat, who revealed the true identities of the Salisbury assassins, say he is registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Military Academy in Moscow.Morenets\u0027 Lada is also registered at GRU’s cyber warfare department down the road - and investigators say by searching other vehicles registered to the same address they have identified 305 other members of the 26165 unit accused of hacking targets all over world.To add to Mr Putin’s embarrassment the leaked list includes his spies\u0027 names, dates of birth and mobile phone numbers - unmasking and effectively dismantling his most elite cyber attack unit.The online expert also uses the online nicknames Lexa and Alexey, according to the FBI, and even  uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital.When he wasn\u0027t targeting anti- doping agencies and helping spread fake news in a bid to level allegations of substance abuse at western athletes, the 41-year-old appeared to be seeking women aged 21 to 30 in Moscow.It was also possible to geolocate the profile to within 650 feet of the GRU headquarters. And the profile picture appears to have been taken close to the intelligence base. The famous Panasonic building is clearly in shot, indicating it was taken on Komsomolsky Prospekt.             Alexei Sergey Vich Morenets uploaded a picture of his face to the website mylove.ru using a photograph taken in the Russian capital               Evgenii Serebriakov, 37, also known as Zhenya, is believed to be hiding in Moscow.The cyber expert used an email with the name Casey Ryback, a character played by Steven Seagal in the film Under Siege, which tells the story of terrorists attacking an American ship.His laptop was packed with details about previous misisons and even contained selfies from the 2016 Olympics in Brazil where Russian athletes\u0027 doping samples were tampered with and US athletes\u0027 medical records leaked.His computer also had the Spiez laboratory in its search history and train tickets to Bern where a wanted to hack more chemical weapons inspectors. He was travelling under his real name and date of birth - and in another fatal error was registered as living at the GRU\u0027s Moscow headquarters.            Evgenii Serebriakov was among four Russians trying to hack chemical weapons inspectors and his laptop contained this selfie  at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil - revealing one of more than a dozen GRU missions across the globe              Artem Malyshev, 30, is described by the FBI as a \u0027senior lieutenant\u0027 in Unit 26165.Born in a small rural town near the picturesque Valdai National Park in the north west of Russia, he went on to become a member of the GRU\u0027s hacking unit.Documents released yesterday state he used the names \u0027djangomagicdev\u0027 and \u0027realblatr\u0027 online as part of the hacking conspiracy.The FBI want him over the hack on the 2016 US presidential election, with the indictment stating he stole and released documents \u0027to interfere with the election\u0027.He is also charged over a wider group of offences, related to hacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the US anti-doping agency.              Baby-faced Ivan Yermakov, 32, was born in the grim, industrial Chelyabinsk region of eastern Russia.US authorities say he was involved in one the first hacks attributed to Unit 26165, reconnaissance of Westinghouse Electric Company\u0027s (WEC) in Pennsylvania, a company involved in the supply of power to the Ukraine.FBI documents state he would often pose as women online.He used the names Kate S. Milton, James McMorgans and Karen W. Millen online.Yermakov was also involved in \u0027spearphishing\u0027 attacks on WADA in 2016, and activities at the Rio Olympics.              Dmitriy Badin, 27, is the youngest of the seven men named by the US yesterday as being part of the hacking group.He was previously named among 12 agents who allegingly hacked into American computers to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.He was born in  Kursk, close to Russia\u0027s border with Ukraine, a city which is forever associated with the Soviet Union\u0027s tank battle victory over the Nazis in the Second World War.He has previously been described as an \u0027Assistant Head of Department\u0027 in the GRU hacking squad.The latest FBI poster states he is wanted over \u0027computer intrusions of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other victim entities during the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics and afterward\u0027.              Hackers\u0027 minder and GRU spy  Alexey Minin, 46, appears to have been in The Hague to protect two hackers trying to break in the OPCW\u0027s WiFi.Bearded Minin is one of the oldest in the group and could be the man who stamped on his phone after being arrested in Holland in AprilThe FBI appear to know little about him including where he was born, his date of birth or if he has any aliases.But it is believed he is an intelligence officer who accompanies and protects GRU hackers on their worldwide trips.He is wanted for conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, the US State Department said yesterday.The FBI wanted poster also says he should be considered \u0027armed and dangerous\u0027 and he is believed to be in Russia.                Oleg Mikhailovich Sotnikov, 46, appears to be a Russian agent in Holland to protect the GRU\u0027s cyber experts.The FBI said he is wanted for money laundering offences in the US and may have been involved in criminal activities since 2014.Like his comrade Minin, little is known about him, including his real name because Sotnikov is believed to be his alias.He posed for a photograph found on  Serebriakov\u0027s laptop outside a Dutch station when they bought tickets for their next mission in Bern.But the team never made it to Switzerland after they were arrested in the Marriott in The Hague and deported from Holland.Sotnikov is considered armed and dangerous and believed to be in Russia.             The GRU - an acronym for Glavnoye razvedyvatel\u0027noye upravleniye or Main Intelligence Directorate - was founded in 1918 after Lenin\u0027s Bolshevik Revolution.Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services and the GRU was seen as a rival by other Soviet secret services, such as the KGB.According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 - tough but unsophisticated.\u0027The GRU took its officers from the trenches,\u0027 he said, whereas KGB picked its agents from the USSR\u0027s best universities.The GRU would train agents and then send them to represent the Soviet Union abroad as military attaches in foreign embassies, according to historian John Barron.But once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to joined foreign agencies were punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning.Unlike the KGB, the GRU was not split up when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.It has a special status and answers directly to the chief of the general staff, one of the three people who control Russia\u0027s portable nuclear control system.GRU chiefs are reportedly picked by Putin himself.The GRU is now considered Russia\u0027s largest foreign intelligence service, according to Reuters, dwarfing Moscow\u0027s better-known Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which is the successor to the KGB\u0027s First Chief Directorate.Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in GRU , was considered by the Kremlin to be one of the most damaging spies of his generation.He was responsible for unmasking dozens of secret agents threatening Western interests by operating undercover in Europe.Col Skripal, 66, allegedly received £78,000 in exchange for taking huge risks to pass classified information to MI6.In 2006, he was sentenced to 13 years in a Russian labour camp after being convicted of passing invaluable Russian secrets to the UK.A senior source in Moscow said at the time: \u0027This man is a big hero for MI6.\u0027                                                       Unit 26165\u0027s trail of blunders: How Putin’s elite globe-trotting hacking squad left a trail of clues including a selfie at the Olympics, a pile of beer cans and a TAXI RECEIPT from their spy base to airportWestern intelligence yesterday revealed the trail of clues that bungling Russian spies known as Unit 26165 left in their wake as they waged a war of disinformation across the globe.Kremlin agents working for the GRU targeted FIFA, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Organisation for the Prevention of the use of Chemical Weapons as it investigated both the Salisbury novichok attack in the UK as well as the Douma chemical weapons attack in Syria, the international investigation of the downing of MH17 and a US company providing nuclear power to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin\u0027s elite squad even created the fake \u0027hacktivist\u0027 group Fancy Bears to disseminate misleading statements designed to exonerate Russia of doping allegations and instead level them at the US.But it was yesterday revealed that the spies left a trail of clues including blunder after blunder during their international campaign.             The team of four GRU officers travelling on official Russian passports entered the Netherlands on April 10 – but it turned out that two of them were carrying documents with consecutive passport numbers      bellingcat - 305 Car Registrations May Point to Massive GRU Security Breach - bellingcat"},{"url":null,"title":"Man puts girlfriend eBay prank","story":"    Dale Leeks, left, put his partner Kelly Greaves on eBay as part of an attempted prank          Within 24 hours, visitors to the auction site had bid £70,000 to buy Ms Greaves, pictured          One person who viewed the listing asked about Ms Greaves\u0027 condition in a similar manner a person would refer to a carComparing his partner of almost a year to an old banger, Mr Leeks\u0027 listing warned there was a \u0027constant whining noise\u0027, with \u0027no serious damage but you can see she\u0027s been used\u0027.He listed the bodywork as \u0027fairly tidy but close up shows signs of wear\u0027 before admitting that \u0027the rear ends leaks a bit but nothing that can\u0027t be plugged\u0027.Diamond thieves who plotted to steal £1m worth of gems in a...Idiot van driver fires a SLINGSHOT out of his window at a...Share this articleThe listing quickly gained traction and racked up 81,00 views in 24 hours - attracting more than 100 bids to reach £70,200.Mr Leeks was inundated with hundreds of messages from potential buyers asking if they could \u0027 take her for a test drive\u0027 or how many \u0027previous owners\u0027 she has had.But just 24 hours after being uploaded, eBay had removed the popular listing and informed Mr Leeks it was on the grounds that \u0027human body parts and remains\u0027 were banned.

Prince Philip, 97, will be 104 when proposed works to the North wing of Buckingham Palace begin between 2025 and 2027The Prince of Wales is said to be \u0027fully engaged\u0027 with the project while the Duke of Edinburgh is also keeping a close eye on developments, having formerly been involved in the reservicing of Windsor Castle in 1992.The senior royal official said palace life would remain \u0027business as usual\u0027, with the historic ceremonies such as the Changing of the Guard continuing.Two lifts are to be installed to improve access to visitors with mobility problems.Workers will tackle three of the wings in clockwise, starting with the East, which has 200 rooms spread over six floors.Some 3,000 Royal Collection items, including 200+ paintings, 40 chandeliers, 1,000 glass and china pieces and 100 mirrors, will be removed before wiring and pipes are replaced.Some 150 items of decorative arts and furniture will return on loan to the Brighton Pavillion, where they were acquired by George IV in the early 1800s.The West wing, where ceremonial duties, state visits and investitures are held, will be tackled \u0027incrementally\u0027 to try and keep it fully operational. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/12/05DA282D000003E8-0-image-a-14_1538738755957.jpg","title":"Is Britains WORST school dinner","story":"    The unappetising meal consisted of two barely cooked sausages, two boiled potatoes, an unidentified desert covered in custard and milk in a plastic cup          The angry mother posted this message online underneath the photograph          The company who supplies the food advertised this meal in its online menu, labelled \u0027butchers pork sausages and gravy\u0027Ms O\u0027Grady posted: \u0027Not even joking this is the s**** St Pius primary school is dishing out too the kids.\u0027She added: \u0027It\u0027s no wonder she asks for money every single day to go to shops with her pals.

He has shown no sign of listening.\u0027We feel good about where we are,\u0027 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters outside the White House.Asked about the meaning of Manchin’s vote, Oklahoma Republican Sen.

Collins kept everyone in the Senate chamber guessing until the end of her hotly anticipated speech, oscillating between praising Kavanaugh and seeming to doubt him          Ninety-six of the 100 senators had declared how they would vote by Friday morning, leaving all the power in the hands of the \u0027final four\u0027 just Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted \u0027no\u0027 on Friday morning          Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted \u0027no\u0027 on Friday\u0027s Kavanaugh motion, defying her party\u0027s leadership and giving Democrats hope that they could still reject Trump\u0027s nominee          Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake put a halt to the confirmation process a week ago by demanding a reopened FBI background check to probe sexual assault claims against Kavanaugh, but by Friday he was satisfied and said he will vote \u0027yes\u0027          \u0027We feel good about where we are,\u0027 President Trump\u0027s Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters outside the White HousePrince Harry and Meghan hold hands during Peacehaven visitMan accused of vandalising protest signs roundhouse kicks womanSurveillance video shows two women \u0027who drugged and robbed man\u0027Prince Harry shakes hands with gleeful school childrenWoman defends two Hiic women who were being abused in a store\u0027Stating the facts\u0027 says Sanders on Trump\u0027s comments about FordPrime Minister Theresa May dances her way onto the stageHeartbreaking moment dog being abandoned chases after its ownerPete Doherty shares video of £500,000 Margate hotel makeoverThieves steal £30,000 car in less than 60 seconds without a keyThe uncertainty after 32-plus hours of hearings and nationwide heartache over unverifiable sexual assault charges underscored a sharp national ide in the Trump Age.Even the delivery of a supplemental FBI background check didn\u0027t quell the chants and songs of protesters descending on Senate office buildings and being arrested by the hundreds. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has long planned to close the book on Kavanaugh before the Columbus Day holiday. An uncharacteristically angry Grassley said on the Senate floor that \u0027the fix was in from the very beginning\u0027 and that Democrats decided to vigorously oppose Kavanaugh in historically reckless fashion.\u0027What left-wing groups and their Democratic allies have done to Judge Brett Kavanaugh is nothing short of monstrous,\u0027 he said, referring to the full-court-press on behalf of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey FordRanking committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein said the FBI\u0027s probe was incomplete and limited, and ignored dozens of \u0027witnesses\u0027 offered Ford and fellow accuser Deborah Ramirez.FBI sources have said the Bureau chose to interview only those people with firsthand knowledge of the 1980s parties both women have described. Four senators out of 100 still had not announced their voting posture as the dust settled Thursday night, including three Republicans ond a lone Democratic holdout. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona stayed with their party. Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin both defected.          Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley told Fox News on Friday morning just hours before a 10:30 a.m. vote that he didn\u0027t know how it would turn out  Thursday was a day of organized protests in hundreds of places across the United States, and the outrage continued Friday          Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein complained Friday on the Senate floor that the FBI\u0027s renewed background check into Kavanaugh ignored witnesses who turned out to have second-hand information  Montana Sen. Steve Daines will not be in Washington on Saturday because of the wedding of his daughter (right), but he will come back quickly if his vote is needed          Outside a secure U.S. Capitol room where senators are permitted to view the FBI\u0027s findings, Manchin told reporters Friday morning that he would not make up his mind on Kavanaugh until he walked onto the Senate floor.The Senate vote on Friday was what is known as a motion to invoke \u0027cloture,\u0027 a procedural step required by the Senate\u0027s arcane rules.The final vote to confirm Kavanaugh will likely come late Saturday. Senate rules require giving Democrats the option of up to 30 hours of debate before that can happen. Grassley said he didn\u0027t blame his undecided Republican colleagues for holding their cards closely on Friday morning.\u0027I think that they want legitimately – and I found myself in the same position, you want to make sure before you make a final decision,\u0027 he said. \u0027You want your constituents to know that you\u0027re very thoughtful about it.\u0027I\u0027ve been in that same position, so I\u0027m not going to hold it against them for not announcing ahead of time,\u0027 Grassley added.Prince Harry and Meghan hold hands during Peacehaven visitMan accused of vandalising protest signs roundhouse kicks womanSurveillance video shows two women \u0027who drugged and robbed man\u0027Prince Harry shakes hands with gleeful school childrenWoman defends two Hiic women who were being abused in a store\u0027Stating the facts\u0027 says Sanders on Trump\u0027s comments about FordPrime Minister Theresa May dances her way onto the stageHeartbreaking moment dog being abandoned chases after its ownerPete Doherty shares video of £500,000 Margate hotel makeoverThieves steal £30,000 car in less than 60 seconds without a keySenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has vowed that the full Senate will vote to confirm Kavanaugh by the end of the week, and a final roll call could come late SaturdayActresses Amy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski are among 302...Now Kavanaugh vote might not happen until Sunday because...Demonstrators take to the streets across the country as...\u0027My tone was sharp and I said things I should not have\u0027:...Senate releases a summary of Brett Kavanaugh FBI report...\u0027The sh*t\u0027s starting to stick\u0027: Trump boards Air Force One...Share this articlePrince Harry and Meghan hold hands during Peacehaven visitMan accused of vandalising protest signs roundhouse kicks womanSurveillance video shows two women \u0027who drugged and robbed man\u0027Prince Harry shakes hands with gleeful school childrenWoman defends two Hiic women who were being abused in a store\u0027Stating the facts\u0027 says Sanders on Trump\u0027s comments about FordPrime Minister Theresa May dances her way onto the stageHeartbreaking moment dog being abandoned chases after its ownerPete Doherty shares video of £500,000 Margate hotel makeoverThieves steal £30,000 car in less than 60 seconds without a keyFlake and Collins signaled Thursday that the FBI\u0027s report made them comfortable supporting Kavanaugh, but stopped short of saying how they would vote.Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Murkowski to vote no, a Senate source told DailyMail.com.But she appeared noncommital to reporters, presenting a picture of indecision.\u0027This has truly been the most difficult evaluation, decision, that I’ve ever had to make,\u0027 Murkowski told reporters. \u0027I believe he’s a good man. It just may be that in my view, he’s not the right man for the court at this time.\u0027In an 11th-hour wrinkle, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines reminded GOP leadership that his daughter\u0027s wedding will keep him two time zones away on Saturday.If Manchin, the lone undecided Democrat, decides to side with Republicans rather than invite the wrath of President Donald Trump in a state he carried in a 42 percentage-point landslide, Republicans will be able to have their way without Daines.Otherwise, the vote could be left open until he returns Sunday to cast the deciding vote. \u0027This is all going to work out,\u0027 Daines told reporters Friday morning at the Capitol. \u0027We’re going to have a new Supreme Court justice this weekend and I’m going to get to walk my daughter down the aisle,\u0027 he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor that Democrats were intent on defending allegations for which there was \u0027no corroborating evidence.\u0027 \u0027Uncorroborated mud and partisan noise ... will not have the final say around here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Facts matter. Fairness matters.\u0027 Kavanaugh, 53, made his own closing argument Thursday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, acknowledging that he had become \u0027very emotional\u0027 in last week\u0027s Judiciary Committee hearing because he was defending himself against \u0027wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations.\u0027           Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and forcibly groping her during a high school party 36 years ago, but the people she cited to corroborate her story have said they don\u0027t remember anything like what she described  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said the FBI\u0027s reopened background check on Kavanaugh was \u0027a bulls**t investigation\u0027          \u0027Let me tell it to my friend, Bob,\u0027 South Carolina Republican Sen.

Bob Menendez of New Jersey told a reporter outside his office: \u0027If that\u0027s an investigation, it\u0027s a bulls**t investigation.\u0027Hours later on Fox News, South Carolina Republican Sen.

He’s currently the Workers’ Party candidate for President of Brazil in the upcoming 2018 election.Haddad was born in São Paulo, Brazil on January 25, 1963.The son of Lebanese immigrants, he earned a master’s degree in economics and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of São Paulo before starting a career as an investment analyst at Unibanco.Haddad later worked as a consultant for the Institute of Economic Research Foundation before moving into public sector work, finding employment as the chief of staff to the Finance and Economic Development Secretary for São Paulo and eventually as a special advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.Climbing the ranks of government steadily, he later was named as the Minister of Education for Brazil in July 2005. During his tenure, Haddad established the Basic Education Development Index to help better measure the quality of public primary and middle schools in Brazil.He also oversaw the implementation of a new scholarship program aimed at helping low-income students attend private colleges and made numerous reforms to the country’s National High School Exam.Haddad left his position in January 2012 and was named as the candidate for Mayor of São Paulo during the 2012 municipal elections in Brazil. After advancing to the second round of the election, he defeated the city’s former mayor, José Serra, with just over 55 per cent of the vote.After assuming his new duties as mayor in January 2013, he implemented a sweeping expansion of the city’s bike lane network but later sparked a major backlash in June of that year after announcing, along with the government of the state of São Paulo, that mass transit ticket prices would be increased.The decision ultimately led to mass protests in the São Paulo and many other major Brazilian cities.          Fernando Haddad served as the Mayor of São Paulo from January 2013 until January 2017By July 2016, Haddad was hobbled by a dismal approval ratings of only 14 per cent of city residents and lost his reelection bid in October 2016 to João Doria, the Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate.He ultimately left office in January 2017 after a four-year tenure as mayor of Brazil’s largest city.As the 2018 Brazil elections loomed, he was named as former President Lula da Silva’s running mate in August in his bid to regain the presidency.However, da Silva was later ruled as disqualified from running for president again by the Superior Electoral Court for violating the country’s Clean Record Act shortly afterwards on August 31 due to his conviction on corruption charges.Haddad was eventually named as da Silva’s replacement by the Workers’ Party on September 11 while Brazil Communist Party legislator Manuela d\u0027Ávila took his place as the candidate for vice president. 2018 Brazil election polls   According a recent Americas SocietyCouncil of the Americas poll, Haddad is currently in second place ahead of the election, which will be held in stages from October 7 to October 28. Haddad leads a number of other candidates but still trails Bolsonaro, the conservative populist frontrunner of the Social Liberty Party who many have compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro leads the poll with 35 percent of the vote while Haddad trails with 22 percent. Notably, Haddad\u0027s polling numbers have largely flatlined in recent days while Bolsonaro has surged ahead, making his victory, while not a sure thing, all the more likely as the election gets underway.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

Professor Rob Krams could be given a restraining order because he bombarded ex-girlfriend Miss Satiene with unwanted affection after they splitShe told the court his correspondence left her ‘anxious and scared’, so much so that by July she had moved address. She said: ‘I feel safer there because he does not know where I live right now.‘I did not know what the next step would be. It made me feel terrible. Even after the police got involved the letters were still coming … he mentioned social class and I felt that he was putting me down.’Krams told the court he had worked in Rotterdam, Holland, before moving to a £900,000 flat in exclusive St John’s Wood, north London, several years ago.In 2016 he met Miss Satiene. He claimed their loving relationship faltered after she began treating him like a wealthy ‘sugar daddy’ by asking him for money.After the split he claimed she made up to 30 silent calls to him, and said he had contacted her because he was worried for his job, as she worked at the same hospital.Krams added: ‘I sent her flowers. I am from a Dutch culture. I bought my ex-wife in Holland flowers almost every week.’In his defence, counsel Georgia Luscombe said: ‘Sending someone a love letter after you’ve broken up may be many things but it is not harassment.’ But magistrate Susan Bright rejected this, saying: ‘We find Mr Krams guilty of the offence of harassment without violence.’She told him he would be sentenced in a fortnight in front of Westminster magistrates. Prosecutors will argue for a restraining order at the next hearing. "},{"url":null,"title":"Former Google boss urges tech giants end delusion making world better place","story":"    Jessica Powell, above, said she had become tired of defending the company in her role as its top PR chief. Miss Powell, 40, launched her searing criticism in an essay and satirical novel, both published this week‘I want Silicon Valley to end the self-delusion and either fess up to the reality we are creating, or live up to the vision we market to the world each day.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

Within that decade, he points to a political revolution wrought by two men: Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich.The MSNBC host is one of the most perceptive political analysts on cable TV. On the page, in a crisp and fast-paced narrative, he lays out his thesis: the last decade of the 20th century gave rise to the tribalism and polarization that dominates American politics today.In his two key figures, Kornacki finds clear antecedents to Trump. Clinton was the original Teflon politician, surviving a host of scandals that would have laid low virtually anyone else. Gingrich was a political steamroller, flattening all sense of bipartisanship in pursuit of Republican goals.There are key supporting roles: Ross Perot, the eccentric billionaire who turned an entire election on its head. Pat Buchanan, proponent of a paleo-conservative, protectionist Republican party.This is by no means a comprehensive history of American politics at the end of the 20th century. One searches the index in vain for a mention of Anita Hill or Clarence Thomas. But it starts, fascinatingly, with Bill Clinton overshadowed by Mario Cuomo at the 1984 Democratic convention. Then Arkansas governor, Clinton is a politician on the make, ready to fight through any obstacle – many self-inflicted – in pursuit of the ultimate prize.His story is interwoven with the rise of Gingrich, who appears on Capitol Hill as a Lucifer character offering Republicans forbidden fruit, the possibility of becoming the majority party despite seeming doomed to forever being the minority. The price? The traditions of civility and decorum that underpinned a long-established order.The narrative proceeds swiftly down two tracks. Clinton hustles on, first to the Democratic nomination and then into the Oval Office, powering through scandals with a mix of political acumen and simple chutzpah. Gingrich advances towards the speaker’s gavel, facing down a series of increasingly maladroit foes culminating in Clinton himself, who fumbles the first two years of his presidency.From there, we watch the two pudgy baby boomers as adversaries through government shutdowns and impeachment. Eventually, Clinton bests his rival, picking up seats in the 1998 midterms. Gingrich resigns before he can be deposed.In aftermath, Hillary Clinton becomes the key surrogate who pushes an underdog Democrat, Chuck Schumer, over the top in his New York Senate race before taking the political plunge herself. As she does, Trump flirts with taking over the Reform party before pulling away.By book’s end, America is ided into red states and blue, poised for the turmoil of Bush v Gore and the Florida recount.Although Kornacki provides a sterling study guide for those millennials who spent the decade more absorbed by Super Mario than Sister Souljah, he merely grazes the surface. The book is based heavily on secondary sources it will leave those with a serious interest in American politics and history wanting more. Kornacki has asked the right questions, indicating the right ground to be plowed by future authors.Hopefully he will be followed, and followed soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d8a3bc6c969c32adfc5589f2729e1419f31b72/22_375_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9cd589d63878c29760c70c4ee2dc21b","title":"man who got swagger back for aston martin is ready for long game stock market","story":"Andy Palmer has written himself into the history books. The Aston Martin chief executive has done something this week that nobody has done for almost 30 years – float a car company on the London Stock Exchange.It doesn’t sound like much. But UK investors are notoriously averse to the thrills and spills offered by car manufacturers, preferring the more esoteric world of outsourcers, service providers and financial firms.In an upstairs room at the London Stock Exchange, immediately after the first dealings, Palmer looked tired but elated – probably just like a boss should look after dragging a loss-making carmaker back from the brink of extinction to the floor of the London Stock Exchange inside four years.The Midlands-based sports car manufacturer, however, appears to have bucked that trend. It has doubled production of its elegant vehicles to 7,000 a year and plans to double again by 2022. The confidence in Aston’s future prospects is rooted in a new factory, just outside Cardiff, which begins production of a new sports utility vehicle (SUV) early next year and will also be the base for its future electric vehicles.“We are still growing when the market is down,” he says. “Which is proof of how insulated we are.”Palmer stands to pocket about £24m from a four-year share-based incentive scheme. Not bad for a working-class boy who grew up with his brother, who is five years younger, only four miles down the road from Aston’s base in Warwickshire. His father was an engineer, his mother a secretary.Palmer also did his apprenticeship down the road at a car parts firm in Leamington Spa 38 years ago. That led to a job at Austin Rover, where he worked on upgrading the Mini and first encountered the jaw-dropping attention to detail that Honda brought to a joint venture.From that moment, Palmer was hooked on Japanese industrial practice. So off he went to Nissan, where he spent 24 years, including a 13-year stint in Japan.The 55-year-old doesn’t just talk the talk, though. He’s a bona fide “petrolhead”, who rides a BMW K1600 motorbike at weekends and races an Aston Martin Vantage GT4.Palmer may not be feeling much Brexit anxiety but, before jumping into the Aston hot seat in October 2014, he was the number three executive at Nissan Group, so he recognises the strain it is placing on his fellow captains of industry.Analysis by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders suggests that EU tariffs on cars alone could add at least an annual £2.7bn to imports and £1.8bn to exports. These import tariffs could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of £1,500.It is a stark prospect for Britain’s car-buying public, who are drawn to the badges of the big European players such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW.Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Ford, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, have all warned that a no-deal Brexit could have dire consequences for the future of their UK car factories.“In the industry, the UK is known as ‘treasure island’ because it’s usually one of the most profitable markets. Why? Because we like cars, so we usually upscale.By 3pm on Wednesday afternoon, Aston’s share price began to rally. Palmer’s spirits, like the stock, lifted momentarily. “That’s America waking up. Look, it’s the first day, so you can’t judge it based on one day,” he says of the early price fall.“We wanted to fill the book with long-only investors and not just go for the quick return.”The share price is at a level that reflects the earnings multiple (about 21 times) applied to New York-listed Ferrari, the other listed luxury car brand. Putting the Aston Martin brand alongside the more globally recognised Ferrari name is rewarding work for Palmer. It has been a long, hard road to get there, however.“The hardest day was in 2015, when I had to make 400 people redundant. That was the shittiest day,” he says. “The cost base was out of control and the management structure was upside down – we had too many managers. We went down to 1,800 people now we have more than 3,000. By 2022, we will have 5,000.”Palmer’s surgical approach may have been tough but he had few options. When he took the wheel at Aston the business was loss-making and there were huge concerns about its future.In 2015 and 2016, the marque made total losses of £291m. After the difficult cost cuts and debt refinancing was done, the business rallied. Last year, it clocked up a full-year profit of £84.5m and it has made further progress this year with a small increase in first-half pre-tax profit to £20.8m.“It was painful,” Palmer says. “The other hard thing was to change the company culture. It was cowering, like a beaten dog. I wanted to get a bit of the swagger back.”That now seems a distant memory for Palmer. The Aston boss reckons the luxury carmaker is no longer a cowering dog: “Aston Martin has got its mojo back,” he says. “It’s great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7895165b1a3f2921ac5d4d662cdce08668806de9/0_812_4749_2849/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3650cd29bb45256cf9d39a1649ad989b","title":"jazz hands manchester clapping","story":"What is the point of clapping? Sitting in the packed overspill hall at Conservative party conference this week, watching Theresa May do her thing via a screen rather than live in person, the surprising thing was that people still clapped, even though they must have known the speaker couldn’t actually hear them. They might as well have been screaming into the void, or sitting in stony silence. But so deeply ingrained is the habit that this ghostly audience still reacted exactly as it would have done in the hall: dutiful smatterings of applause where they know they’re meant to show approval, more enthusiastic king of hands for the bits they actually like. There’s something curiously satisfying about applauding things that move us, so much so that trying to stop yourself feels awkward and frustrating.Ironically, that’s roughly how some autistic people also feel about flapping their hands, or rocking back and forwards, or other so-called stimming behaviours that may come out when excited, or anxious, or overwhelmed by noise and lights and stimuli. The difference is that clapping is thoroughly acceptable in polite society and stimming isn’t, so some autistic people spend a great deal of energy trying to suppress the urge in a way that must feel pretty awkward and frustrating too. And it’s this question of who should be accommodating whom – how far it’s up to neurological square pegs to cram themselves into the round holes provided, and how far it’s up to the rest of us to make more generous allowances – that is at the heart of an otherwise rather madly overblown argument about clapping.When the National Union of Students announced some years ago that it would rather people expressed approval at its events by waving their hands about, supposedly to avoid distressing autistic students or those who can’t handle loud noises, I admit I thought it was ridiculous. But this week, when Manchester students also voted to encourage what’s become known as jazz hands (although strictly speaking the hand-waving is a sign language signal used by the deaf), I found I’d changed my mind. If Generation Z can at times be solicitous of other people’s feelings to a fault, then in the week that the US president publicly mocked a woman’s testimony of sexual assault, frankly I’ll take excessive kindness over cruelty any day. The idea is not itself above criticism. Given the countless sensory challenges presented by universities crammed full of overexuberant people who have just left home, clapping may not come terribly high on the list of obstacles to inclusion. And while it turns out that one reason “jazz hands” caught on is that for many autistic people flapping your hands to show emotion feels innately satisfying, for some a sea of waving hands could be as overwhelming a stimulus as a barrage of noise. There’s no solution that suits everyone.That’s presumably not why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, declared that banning clapping would be “bonkers”, however. For its critics, this is yet more proof that Generation Snowflake is composed of ridiculously sensitive little flowers who will never cope in the real world, what with their trigger warnings and their “safe spaces” and their no-platforming Germaine Greer, and who urgently need to get a grip.But like this week’s other silly argument, over the journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer filming herself shouting “boo!” from inside the Labour party conference’s “safe space” (basically a glorified cupboard with some chairs in it), it confuses genuinely troubling free speech issues with what are essentially questions of manners.Banning Hartley-Brewer from next year’s conference is frankly an overreaction from a party that would be better employed making its Jewish MPs feel safe walking around without police protection. But getting annoyed by physical “safe spaces” is overreacting too, in a different way. Obviously, shutting down serious debate on challenging ideas by claiming the mere idea of a discussion violates someone’s emotional “safe space” is wrong. But providing a quiet physical bolthole for anxiety sufferers wanting to ward off a full-blown panic attack, or autistic people feeling a bit overwhelmed in a noisy and crowded place, is a kind, practical gesture that at best meets a need and at worst does nobody any harm. It may seem a bit worthy and unnecessary to people who didn’t grow up with it, but doubtless the same was once said of providing creches and baby-changing spaces in the loos.And if it feels as if the pendulum is being pushed too far towards inclusivity and tolerance, it’s worth first remembering that student politicians have been pushing things too far since time immemorial and, second, considering the alternative. Within living memory, in Britain, gay people were being advised to “cure” themselves by getting married, Jewish immigrants to change their surnames, black women to straighten their hair and lighten their skins, and clever women to forget about unbecomingly masculine careers and concentrate on motherhood.We have been forcing square pegs into round holes for generations, in some cases causing untold pain and misery and in others something closer to exhaustion. It is debilitating to struggle constantly to “fit in” with a ridiculously narrow social norm, to grow up knowing that your mind just doesn’t seem to work in the way other people’s seemingly does or that what comes naturally to you is deemed wildly embarrassing – and saddest of all is that it’s often unnecessary given a bit of goodwill on all sides. If those in Generation Z want to try erring more heavily on the side of kindness, then they probably deserve a more considered response than mass sniggering from the cheap seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf98fa0d9db2f3fdc4f94b391ac7d6b32fcb8ec6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83ae8dc7f1aa0c10ce46ece33be0b6b","title":"michael freedland dad showed how to be journalist jew man","story":"If it were up to me, I’d write this piece next week or perhaps the week after. Let the dust settle a bit. But I have my father’s voice in my head, and he’s insistent: the story is now, so you write it now. No one wants to read last week’s news. I’m listening to that voice because my father, Michael, died unexpectedly this week. He was a journalist to his core. He started at age 16, straight out of school in 1951, on his local paper, the Luton News – and once he’d started, he never stopped.After nine years on the Luton paper, he graduated to Fleet Street and the Daily Sketch before embarking on a six-decade freelance career that saw him write more than 40 biographies of Hollywood stars and spend a quarter-century presenting a weekly radio show, to say nothing of a brief stint as PR man for Bertrand Russell and a day in court being sued by James Cagney. (Happily, that was one shootout the gangster-movie legend lost.)He was working to the very end. He died after suffering a heart attack in the tiny, faraway town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, researching the birthplace of his latest biographical subject – a Hollywood lawyer called Charles “Chuck” Levy. That’s right: at age 83, notebook in hand, my father was on a story. Which meant he died doing what he loved. As fate would have it, the day after his death this newspaper carried an article written by him a few months earlier: an obituary of Charles Aznavour, who, like him, died on Monday. So Michael Freedland went out the way he would have wanted – with a byline.Over the last few days, in between calls to the county coroner in South Dakota – which sounds like a plotline from one of the 1940s movies he loved – I’ve been thinking of all my father taught me. To state the obvious, I got an early education in old-school journalism. He used to joke that I learned the trade through osmosis, and there’s something to that. To reach my childhood bedroom, you had to go through his study: I would fall asleep to the clack-clack-clack of his typewriter or his voice dictating copy. During school holidays, I would sit and watch him through the glass of the radio studio, smiling and laughing as his guests talked, ensuring they were relaxed enough to open up. And when I edited my university newspaper, it was my dad I went to, looking on as he, pencil in hand, sketched out a blueprint for what would become a wholesale redesign.I learned about deadlines and accuracy, though my shorthand never matched his: it was his notebook that recorded Harold Macmillan declaring during a 1957 speech in Bedfordshire that Britons had “never had it so good”. (The young Luton News man was the only reporter present, promptly filing those words from a nearby phone box.)I imbibed his rule about professional clothing, one he had been taught by his first boss. “A reporter should dress so that he’s ready to interview either a coalminer or the archbishop of Canterbury at a moment’s notice.” Even when he was working at home, my father would follow that rule: shirt and tie, every day. A dapper dresser to the last, he never so much as owned a pair of jeans.In that insistence on a hybrid, hyphenated identity – familiar to Americans but much rarer in the Britain of 50 years ago – my father was, I now realise, something of a pioneer. While other Jews whispered their identity, my dad was out and proud. (Young and desperate to get to Fleet Street, he was once offered a job on the Daily Herald – with one condition: that he wrote under a pseudonym. They already had a couple of Jewish-sounding names and thought they’d reached their limit. He refused.)But that never stopped him feeling proudly, fully British. He was a political junkie, permanently glued to the radio news and seizing on polls for any sign of encouragement for his team – Labour, naturally. He was Labour the same way he was Jewish: as a matter of commitment and tradition. Every election day he wore a red tie, for good luck. In recent months, when I wrote about those lifelong Jewish Labour voters who had always regarded the party as their home, and who were now heartbroken by its failures on antisemitism, it was my father I had in mind.A second lesson was about masculinity. My father never took me to the football or taught me to change a tyre. In a pub, he might manage half a lager, but his prime focus would usually be the food menu. He was a model of a different kind of maleness.Driven, competitive and no new man – he was not present for the birth of any of his three children, though he was proud of having done nightly bottle feeds for my sister Dani – he was nevertheless tender and, for a man of his generation, unusually demonstrative. Even as adults, he and I never met without a hug and a kiss. He was the very model of a loving, faithful husband to my mother, Sara, during their 52 years of marriage. They had a goodnight song, which he sang to her each night, even when she lay on her deathbed. Channelling Bing Crosby, he would croon, “I’ve waited all my life  To give you all my love.”But perhaps the biggest lesson I learned from him was about tenacity and resilience. He sustained deep blows, losing both his wife and firstborn child, my sister Fiona, within two years of each other. And yet, somehow, he got back up again. He taught himself to cook and, of course, he wrote about it. He continued to dress nattily, picking out a bright blazer or jacket that ensured he stood out in a room. He found love again. And he would meet commissioning editors a third his age and pitch stories with the same hunger he had 65 years earlier. Younger colleagues keep using the same word about him: charming.I will need some of his resilience now. I hope I learned it from him, the way I learned about being a journalist, a Jew, a man. People keep telling me that my father was proud of me and while that’s a great comfort, the truth is I was proud of him. Raised in a hard-up corner of wartime England, he went off to see the world – and he never stopped looking forward and upward, gazing at the stars."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen colbert on fbis kavanaugh inquiry the report is lacking in report","story":"Late-night comics discussed the disappointingly rushed investigation into supreme court nominee Brett KavanaughLate-night hosts took apart the FBI’s brief investigation into supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying it lasted “half a Scaramucci”.On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the week-long investigation, the results of which have just been released to senators. “Before the FBI investigation, both sides were confused and angry,” he said. “Now both sides are confused and furious.”The White House released a positive statement at 2.30am, a time “typically when you release your drunkest tweets”.The report is being kept under lock and key, only able to be seen by a select few. “I would say they’re treating this report like the nuclear launch codes but then I remember, they have given the launch codes to an idiot,” he joked.Many of the potential interviewees weren’t contacted by the FBI, leading many to question the report’s worth. “Democrats would say the report is lacking in report,” he said.Included in the group of people not interviewed is Kavanaugh himself and his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford. “That’s like investigating an arson and saying we’re not really looking into the fire part,” he said.Colbert continued: “I’ve had more thorough investigations to find my AirPods.”On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also brought up his concerns over the report. “I don’t know if we can call a five-day investigation sufficient,” he said. “Although I get why the White House thinks it is. They’ve never spend five consecutive days on anything.”He joked that it “lasted half a Scaramucci”.Noah then spoke about the unimportance of its quality. “It doesn’t matter that this investigation was thorough,” he said. “What matters is that it gives these moderate Republicans the cover they need to vote yes.”He continued: “Basically Mitch McConnell conducted this process the same way a parent checks under their kid’s bed for monsters.”Ultimately, he doesn’t think that anything can stop Kavanaugh now. “I’m an optimist but it doesn’t seem like there’s much anybody can do besides wait and see,” he said. “We might as well go out and get drunk like Brett Kavanaugh and try to forget that this ever happened like Brett Kavanaugh.”On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host replayed clips from the past week, including Trump’s assertion that he would be a bad drunk. “You already scream and yell and slur your words like a stumbling drunk,” he joked.He moved on to the FBI investigation which he also found concerning. “They really went over this thing with a no-toothed comb,” he said.Reportedly, one potential character witness tried to contact the FBI directly but had to settle for their web portal. “No one should ever have to log on to the FBI’s web portal,” he said. “You shouldn’t have to contact the FBI the same way I pay my dentist.”He also detailed how many shortcuts the FBI reportedly took in its reporting. “You guys are like treasure hunters who decided to call it quits before you flipped over the map,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa896a200d9cfa2174e5f9f2c44aad4b097a4f3f/0_34_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f3e9649418c480d26856a6389b4c3f2","title":"why the next four months are crucial for future of planet climate change","story":"Two forthcoming major climate talks offer governments an opportunity to respond to this year’s extreme weather with decisive actionThe warning signals of climate change that have hit people around the world in the last few months must be heeded by national governments at key meetings later this year, political leaders and policy experts are urging, as the disruption from record-breaking weather continues in many regions.Extreme weather events have struck around the world – from the drought and record temperatures in northern Europe, to forest fires in the US, to heatwaves and drought in China, to an unusually strong monsoon that has devastated large areas of southern India.As the northern hemisphere summer closes, polar observations have just established that the Arctic sea ice narrowly missed a record low this year. The sea ice extent was tied for the sixth lowest on record with 2008 and 2010. Sea currents and wind conditions can have large effects on sea ice extent from year to year, but the trend is starkly evident.“Put simply, in the last 10 years the Arctic is melting faster than it ever has previously since records began,” said Julienne Stroeve, professor at University College London. “We have lost over half of the summer sea ice coverage since the late 1970’s and it is realistic to expect an ice-free Arctic sea in summer in the next few decades.”Of particular concern is the decline in thick ice which forms over several years. “The older ice has been replaced by more and more first-year ice, which is easier to melt out each summer,” she explained.Not all of the effects of this year’s extraordinary weather, which has also seen the UK’s joint hottest summer on record, can be traced directly to climate change. However, scientists are clear that the background of a warming planet has made extremes of temperature, and accompanying droughts and floods, more likely.This week, scientists are gathering in South Korea to draw together the last five years of advances in climate science to answer key questions for policymakers. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) celebrates its 30th birthday this year with what is likely to be a landmark report to be released on Monday 8 October. What is expected to emerge will be the strongest warning yet that these unusual occurrences will add up to a pattern that can only be overcome with drastic action.Thousands of the world’s leading climate experts collaborate on the periodic reports, released roughly every half-decade. They have grown clearer over the years in the certainty of their evidence that climate change is occurring as a result of human actions, and firmer in their warnings of the disruptive consequences.This time, the scientists will attempt to answer whether and how the world can meet the “aspiration” set in the Paris agreement of 2015 to hold warming to no more than 1.5C, beyond which many low-lying states and islands are likely to face dangerous sea level rises.When the scientists deliver their verdict, the onus will pass to politicians to translate their advice into concrete action. Already in recent weeks, global initiatives have begun aimed at doing so: the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco last month spurred protests, and dozens of local governments and multinational companies to make pledges the second One Planet Summit saw advances in climate finance while at the UN General Assembly, secretary general António Guterres urged world leaders to step up, calling climate change “the defining issue of our time”.Evidence showing that tackling climate change can be an economic boost rather than a brake has been growing. The recently published New Climate Economy report says more than 65m new low-carbon jobs could be created in just over a decade, and that 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution could be avoided every year by government action on climate change. A further $2.8tn could be added to government revenues by 2030 by reforming perverse incentives to burn fossil fuels.The existence of tipping points – thresholds of temperature beyond which certain natural processes become irreversible, such as the melting of permafrost, which may release the greenhouse gas methane and create runaway warming effects – is a key concern of many climate scientists. The faster emissions rise, the sooner we may unwittingly pass some of these key points.For all these reasons, the IPCC’s special report comes at a crucial point. Scientists and economists have warned that if the world cannot shift course within the next few years, the consequences will be dire, as new infrastructure built now – in energy generation, transport and the built environment – will be made either to low-emissions standards or in the high-emissions habits of the past. As the IPCC’s next comprehensive assessment of climate science will not be available until 2021, this year’s report will be vital in shaping policy.Ted Chaiban, director of programmes at Unicef, urged governments to seize the opportunities for action offered by this year’s series of political meetings offers for action. “Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations,” he said. “As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price,” he said.“It is vital that governments and the international community take concrete steps. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.”After the IPCC publication, the world will face a key test of faith in the 2015 Paris agreement, the only global pact stipulating action on temperature rises. This December in Poland, the UN’s climate change arm will hold a two-week meeting aimed at turning the political resolve reached in Paris three years ago into a set of rules for countries to follow on reducing emissions.The political situation is more fraught than it was in the runup to Paris. The US is pulling out of the landmark climate agreement and is likely to play little part in the talks. Australia’s government is also in turmoil over climate actions. Now the challenger for Brazil’s presidency, Jair Bolsonaro, is threatening to withdraw its participation – a potential blow to the Paris consensus, as Brazil was a linchpin among rapidly developing nations.All eyes will be on China, which has shown remarkable progress on renewable energy and emissions reduction, and India, where climate champions have found common cause with opponents of increasingly damaging air pollution. Patricia Espinsoa, the UN’s top climate official, warned that only “uneven progress” had been made so far on the 300-page rulebook for implementing the Paris targets, leaving the rest of the work for December.While the dangerous weather of the first half of 2018 has raised concerns worldwide that we are seeing climate change in action, many leading experts told the  they were optimistic that political and business leaders this year would help set the world on a different course to avoid the worse predictions of untrammelled warming.Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said the past few years had seen “extraordinary progress” in areas such as renewable energy and the take-up of low-carbon technology: “This is real, not in the future but happening now. We are showing that we can do this, we can bring down emissions, it doesn’t need to be a disaster.”Adopting low-carbon aims now would set developing countries on a course to a brighter future, added Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former economic minister of Nigeria and a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. “Now is the time to do this, before we lock in high-carbon infrastructure,” she said. “Now is the opportunity for real sustainable growth.”Political leaders will find that global investors back them up in opting for low-carbon policies, predicted Frank Rijsberman of the Global Green Growth Institute. “I see this from investors, from businesses,” he said. “They are ready, and they see low-carbon as the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6e2088fc24c661dea90b6e428b96e3a62f3f78b/0_147_4715_2830/master/4715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218cab61ba136c7cc21dcf45fc6f4831","title":"fish dwindle traditionally rich waters tanzania kivukoni dar es salaam in pictures","story":"In Kivukoni fish market, the port city of Dar es Salaam boasts a thriving economic enterprise.

The veteran striker has now found the net six times against them in the Premier League and took his tally for the calendar year to 12 as Brighton secured their fourth top-flight victory at home over the east London side in as many attempts.Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy are the only English players to outscore the 35-year-old in 2018 and there is no doubting his value to Brighton, with Chris Hughton’s side not having won since beating Manchester United in their second match of the season. But even though Marko Arnautovic wasted a great chance to snatch a point at the death following Murray’s 25th-minute effort – his 99th in total for the club – it was a relatively comfortable night for a team who had looked in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle before the match.“It’s what he does best,” Hughton acknowledged of Murray. “Glenn has always had the knack of being in the right place at the right time – he’s a player who has looked after himself really well and that enables him not only to get the goals but to have an impact in the game.”Asked if Murray should be considered for an England call-up, Hughton added: “All I can speak about is what Glenn gives us. For somebody at this stage of the season to have scored five goals in the Premier League for this club is a big achievement.”Brighton had previously failed to record a clean sheet this campaign – a statistic that would have troubled Hughton given last season’s success was built on defensive solidity. As if to underline his confidence in central defenders Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk, the news that they had both signed new five-year contracts was announced hours before kick-off, while the recall of the club captain, Bruno – now 38 – was also designed to strengthen a backline that has already conceded 13 goals this season.One unfamiliar name on the Brighton team sheet was Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who was handed his first Premier League start after his arrival for a club record £17m in the summer. The Iran forward showed some bright touches but struggled to make an impression in a congested midfield area in the opening exchanges, although Anthony Knockaert did manage to produce a shot on target in Brighton’s only real chance of note until Murray’s opener.Yarmolenko was slow to react to pressure from Beram Kayal and the Israeli’s brilliant cross left Murray with a simple tap-in.After losing their first four games of the season, West Ham had seemed to have found their feet under Manuel Pellegrini but lacked the intensity on display during the wins over Everton and United. Despite dominating possession in the second half, Arnautovic, who came into the game carrying a knee injury, was the only real attacking threat of note and he sailed close to the wind after arguing with referee Kevin Friend over his booking for a studs-up challenge on Kayal.It was the Austrian’s prompting that saw Fabián Balbuena’s effort deflected wide for a corner, only for the defender to then waste a golden chance having freed himself from the attentions of Murray at the back post.Brighton’s talisman will have been disappointed not to have hit the target with a free header 20 minutes from time, while another effort looped agonisingly over Lucasz Fabianksi’s bar. He did put the ball in the net in stoppage time but saw his effort correctly ruled out for offside, with Arnautovic then blasting over from close range on an evening that Pellegrini will want to forget.“It was frustrating because we knew we were playing a difficult team who are very strong at home but we created three good chances to draw so I cannot be happy,” he said.“Maybe in the first 45 minutes they played with more intensity but in the second half we had the pace and played some good football. But you have to score.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba07b39103c58b89e7baa11566fb92b6dccbff93/2_0_3020_1813/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a625a8c99eddad67eff49f2406b76128","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool premier league manchester city","story":"The Anfield club’s rivalry with Manchester City may not be fully fledged but it has become a byword for entertainmentTwo giant spectaculars are taking place in Liverpool this weekend, one courtesy of the French street theatre company Royal de Luxe and the other thanks to the emergence of Jürgen Klopp’s team as a formidable obstruction in the way of Manchester City’s vast ambition. Only the former’s route around the city has been publicised, however, as Merseyside Police seek to avoid the unsavoury scenes that greeted the champions’ arrival at Anfield in April. A repeat of what both clubs delivered on the pitch last season will be embraced by those seeking a new Premier League rivalry.Liverpool versus Manchester City does not have the history, the animosity – even accounting for a damaged City coach – or the decisive influence on silverware to be ranked among the true rivalries of the Premier League era. Not yet, anyway. “Bollocks,” was Klopp’s response when the suggestion was put to him on Friday. But the potential exists for one to take root. Anfield staged the finest Premier League game of last season when Pep Guardiola’s side suffered their first defeat in 23 league games in January, though not without a fight. Sunday provides the most eagerly anticipated contest of this campaign with the teams boasting identical unbeaten records and the two managers confident their squads have improved.In terms of spectacle and quality, if not rivalry, it is undoubtedly the strongest the Premier League currently has to offer. Liverpool can deliver the biggest statement of their title credentials so far with a sixth consecutive home league win over City. Equally, there is no better place for Guardiola and his players to prove his point about improving on excellence than Anfield.“They are really good and we have to prove that we are as good as we can be and we showed that in a few moments. But even if we had won at Napoli I wouldn’t sit here now and say: ‘Yes, this is the game between the two big ones, United is not there any more.’ That is obviously bollocks. We face a very strong team again and it will be very difficult again, that is all.”Klopp believes it is folly to promote the claims of two clubs in the Premier League when the leading pack are growing ever stronger. He also did not disguise the fact that despite his record of beating a Guardiola team seven times, more than any other manager, and last season’s victories in the Premier League and Champions League, Liverpool must improve their recent record of success to be considered a genuine threat to the champions.“We played Chelsea twice last week,” he said. “I cannot understand how we can ignore them. They are much more proven winners than we are. I’m not sure if we are much younger than the Chelsea squad but we are a good age group and we should have had time already together to reach another level. But that is our target of course. You play against these big teams only twice in a normal season and that means you have to take points in all the other games.“Two years ago we had a fantastic record against the top six but it was like: ‘Yes, they are good against them but not so good against all the others.’ We always find something if you don’t win all of these games. That’s where we want to be but I am not sure in this moment if we are there. We will see.“We cannot do more in a specific weekend than beating them. In this moment there is no pressure. If this was matchday 30 then we would have to see who can deal with it. Last year it was City being champions, before that it was Chelsea who were champions and we were champions something like 40 years ago. We have to see. We don’t know.”Liverpool may be more reliant on their defensive strength than attacking quality on Sunday with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané yet to rediscover last season’s outstanding form. Salah’s difficulties continued in the midweek Champions League defeat at Napoli where, of Liverpool’s starting XI, he received fewer passes than any player bar Naby Keïta, who was carried off injured after 19 minutes. Salah received 17 passes to Firmino’s 28 and Mané’s 23, underlining how last season’s phenomenal rise has prompted opponents to respond in kind. They remain key to Sunday’s spectacle, however, and to Klopp’s prospects of savouring his latest encounter with Guardiola.The Liverpool manager explained: “After we drew at Chelsea last week I turned to Maurizio Sarri and he was smiling at me. He looked at me and said: ‘You enjoy that?’ I said: ‘Actually, yes I do!’ I loved that game and the City games were very good games too. I said it a few times and I will say it again: I really think the most important thing for football – the most important job of football – is entertaining people because it’s only football, nothing else.“We don’t save lives, we don’t create anything, we are not good in surgeries, we are only good in football. If we would not entertain the people then why would we play it? It’s not always possible unfortunately and it’s always hard work – it’s especially hard work if we’re entertaining people – but that’s really important and that’s why we have to try to create constantly or as often as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43c1a50083d76babe320d390807ed091f33a084/0_30_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1d00bfe830dbd0e600407e26d6b10555 1000w","title":"i never believed there could a be tsunami palu survival and loss indonesia","story":"A week on, survivors in flattened Indonesian city try to stem the tears as they recount their storiesby  Kate Lamb in PaluAmirullah, 55, was having a late afternoon nap in his home on Palu bay when the earthquake shook him awake. In the lounge his seven-year-old granddaughter was watching cartoons. She was so close to the screen that the 7.5-magnitude quake caused the television set to crash down on her head.“I told my wife to grab her and run first, and that I would stay and help my cousin,” said Amirullah, recounting the disasters that hit Palu, on Sulawesi island in Indonesia, last Friday. His cousin, 70, who was experiencing an episode of gout, needed his help.As the ground continued to shake they managed to reach the car, but it would not start. That was when the first tsunami struck – just five to 10 minutes after the quake hit – sending them up the street in a powerful whoosh and then back toward the house as the water receded into the next massive wave.Amirullah, tall and fit, grabbed hold of his roof on the slide back and yanked himself and his cousin up on to the tiles.Maruni, his wife, had jumped into the car of a fleeing stranger, while his 12-year-old nephew, Riswan, who had been praying at Arqam mosque, survived by clinging on to a coconut tree.Each personal experience would be shared two days later when the family was reunited, but while on the roof Amirullah thought he would never see them again.He chose the roof because he thought that if he died it would be easier for his wife to find him, rather than “washed up by a tsunami, God knows where”.From there he had a clear view over the sea, to the left the Donggala regency and to the right, Talise beach in Palu. He stood in horror and awe as tsunami waves from each side met in the middle, and twice more smashed down.The first of three waves was clear, but the second and most powerful one was muddy. Amirullah estimates that it reached six metres in height Indonesia’s disaster agency said it could have been traveling at 250mph (400km  h).When movement in the Palu Koro fault caused last Friday’s quake, there was no official warning on the ground that a tsunami could follow. Straddling multiple tectonic plates, earthquakes are common in Indonesia. But residents in Palu say they are shocked a tsunami hit their bay, first smashing into Donggala on the western tip and then barrelling into Palu’s usually calm waters.“I never believed there could be a tsunami here. Palu is on a bay, not open sea,” says Maruni,shaking her head and fighting back tears.The 50-year-old returned to her house for the first time on Friday morning, a week after the quake and tsunami flattened parts of the coastline, killing more than 1,571 people. Less than a mile from her home the Ponulele Bridge lies semi-submerged left and right the view is one of devastation.“It’s just crazy. Crazy,” says Maruni, as she searches through the rubble of her home for important documents – land titles, school certificates, family photos.Driving along the coastline the seemingly fickle nature of the damage is striking, swaths are flattened, while some buildings stand untouched.Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman, said high-resolution satellite data showed how Palu’s topography dictated how far the tsunami penetrated inland.When the wave met rivers, he said, it reached a mile and a half inland. In other areas, blocked by hills, it only reached as far as 2,000ft.But everywhere you go in Palu there are stories of loss and survival, each with their own set of dramatic and strange details.In the village of Loli Dongo on Donggala’s coast, Suriyani was knocked to the floor by the earthquake while she was praying. She ran up the hill behind her when she saw the sea was bubbling, and then watched as the tsunami hit her house below. Descending in the morning, she noticed the trail of beached tropical fish on top of the rubble.On Talise beach, the annual Palu Nomoni cultural festival was meant to be in full swing last Friday night.In an attempt to explain the incomprehensible destruction, some have blamed the traditional animist rituals, such as throwing a live goat and flowers into the water to appease the sea gods, that residents say were a part of the festival. They believe God is punishing them for erging from Islam, the dominant religion in Indonesia.Last year, the festival was followed by a devastating storm at the time, local Islamic leaders said the event should have been banned. This year, the festival is a marker for devastating loss.A week after the disaster, a few angry signs haand appeared around a horse statue on Talise beach that allude to the perceived wrath from above. Scrawled on one in big silver letters is “we reject Satan worshippers”.When the earthquake and tsunami hit, a group of dancers from the festival were performing, swallowing fire and swirling around to a quick drum beat, said Setyo Wibowo, a nearby shop owner.On Friday, Setyo was still searching for his daughter and daughter in-law who were on the beach for the festival. All the dancers, he noted, are also missing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3ce534f249bd0adde24551616b6f0ac9caaa37b/7_6_1187_712/master/1187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=905921c63e025f9a2723022ae0add9da","title":"blind date max james","story":"What were you hoping for?To get through dinner without wanting to leave.

It’s like a form of meditationI built a desk. OK, fine – I assembled one from the carefully measured and cut pieces of cheap, painted MDF that arrived in a slim but sturdy cardboard box. But you simply cannot convince me I did not fell a mighty teak tree, before carving, lacquering and buffing it into a desk at which I can now sit and ruminate on the larger questions of life, all from a corner of my living room. You can’t.Blame the countless hours I have poured into viewing home-improvement shows over the years (bless Changing Rooms, my first romance in the field), but there’s nothing I love more than interior design. It is easily the thing I am most interested in without having a single thing to qualify me. For years, my sister and I assembled shelves, bookcases, shoe racks and entertainment centres as a necessary hobby (we couldn’t afford one-off or even mildly expensive pre-assembled furniture) and that slowly evolved into flatpack love.I’m one of those people who follows the instructions to the letter. I lay out every piece, with a pencil either stuck behind my ear or gripped between my teeth, and then I check them off against the pamphlet. I grab a screwdriver, prepare my workspace, cue up the YouTube tutorial video, put on an appropriate TV show or playlist, and then, when I’m sitting comfortably, I begin. It’s like a form of meditation.The resulting desk, white and, surprisingly, seemingly solid, feels like a reward, on two levels. I did this with my own two hands! Hard work almost always feels good.

There’s greater uncertainty about the future and more choice about when and how to retire – or, indeed, whether to retire at all work is increasingly part of retirement. Yet this generation is still held back by outdated myths. At one extreme, retirement is still seen as living the dream in a rose-covered country cottage at the other, it’s filling time on life’s scrap heap until you die.No wonder people dread the R-word. And that’s a crying shame, because it can – should – be the best time of your life. All that’s needed is a bit of planning and preparation, and debunking some long-held myths.Bring up the subject of retirement, and the conversation automatically turns to ageing (think “retirement villages”). It’s a knee-jerk association that totally misses the mark. It’s also unhelpful. The issues people wrestle with when they retire are about changing, not ageing, and about negotiating one of the biggest transitions we face in life. That’s recognised in research for the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which looks at the lessons people learn from other major transitions, such as having a baby or orce, and how they can use the resilience and strength built up in times of crisis and change. It sees retirement as a time to harvest previous life experiences and skills.Yet the link with old age remains an offputting distraction that’s hard to shake. Ageist stereotypes about what people are capable of in retirement can make it harder to get a job in your 50s and beyond, be it part-time, paid or unpaid. And ageism is catching it eats into self-esteem.No wonder people approaching retirement go into denial until the reality hits them head-on. This generation of sixtysomethings don’t see themselves as old. Many have more vim and vigour than their parents did at the same age and can expect to live longer – on average into their late 80s. “Old age” now encompasses a vast  of years, from 65 to 100. Looking back on how much your life changed between 25 and 60 is just one indication of how many possibilities could lie ahead.You’d think so, given that “retirement advice” invariably means “pensions advice”. There’s much less support around the huge psychological and emotional challenges of giving up work, such as loss of identity, finding a new purpose and building new social networks.The obvious link between money and a good retirement is undeniable – no one can find fulfilment if they can’t afford the basics – but that goes for every stage of life. While, for some, a pension is the liberation it should be, because it allows them to explore what they really want to do in life, now that they no longer have to bring home the bacon, the sad truth is that many people are strapped for cash and can’t afford to retire. These days, retirement involves some work for more than 1.4 million over-65s in the UK, either because they want to or because they have no choice.But while pensions may be more complex since the 2015 reforms, keep in mind that financial planning should be just one part of a much bigger retirement jigsaw. Don’t fixate on the money.In a long-hours culture that places a high value on career status and success, it’s not surprising that retirement is seen as an end, rather than the start of something new and full of potential. What makes matters worse is that we’re now encouraged to work into our late 60s and beyond, so retirement looks even more like a cop-out.But it’s a mistake to think that you have to be in paid employment to be productive or fulfilled. In fact, many people achieve much more when they retire than they ever did at work, pursuing activities – through learning, politics, volunteering, mentoring – that resonate with deeply held convictions, and picking up old interests they gave up reluctantly. One former policeman told me that his achievements at work were nothing compared with the satisfaction of smashing his drum exam.What’s more, the assumption that you have to be constantly busy to achieve anything needs to be challenged. One of the most precious things about retirement is the opportunity to work out genuine priorities, and to be true to yourself. This may involve taking a second look at what we value when being paid is out of the equation. It may involve an exploration of the spiritual side of life. Above all, it means accepting that the working world’s definition of “achievement” is severely limited.In fact, health and wellbeing often increase, according to the Office for National Statistics, while depression and anxiety often fall. It’s not hard to see why: when people aren’t constantly rushing around, they pay more attention to a healthy lifestyle there’s time to find new sources of fulfilment and exercise. Yet the fear of losing your edge without the daily stimulus and social connections of work is all too common. We’ve all heard stories about people who spiral into ill-health and depression within months of stopping work. Anyone with few outside interests is vulnerable, although inidual reactions are unpredictable. It sounds surprising, but workaholics often love retirement as much as they loved their jobs. The secret is curiosity. So it’s a big mistake to see work as the only way to stay mentally and physically sharp: in retirement, there are many more ways to stay on your mettle. But you have to be proactive. One of the biggest myths about retirement is that it’s a passive stage of life. It’s actually quite the opposite, but with no one else to goad you into action, it’s entirely up to you to make stuff happen. That’s not a problem if you’re curious and keep stretching your boundaries, both physically and mentally. But it’s not going to happen to people who while away the time in front of a screen waiting for wine o’clock. Even devoted couples panic, whether they retire together or one after the other. And it still seems to be women who worry most about how they’ll cope when their partner is at home all day. The dramatic change of routine, and in the couple’s inidual and joint identities, are bound to have a massive impact. But it may well be a positive development – in the long term, at least. Several studies here and in the US show that retirement actually improves marriages. But the same studies show that, in the short term, the transition from work to a home-based daily rubbing along together can be a source of conflict. If it’s managed carefully, even a turbulent period of adjustment can be productive. Retirement prompts the kind of shake-up that many long-term relationships need. By forcing couples to hammer out their differences and talk about their expectations, it keeps the relationship developing, moving forward and very much alive.A common bone of contention is when partners find that their loved one’s vision of the next stage is different from their own. That doesn’t have to be the kiss of death, although it’s clear from rising over-60s orce rates that the pressure on already rocky marriages can prove too much. By contrast, retirement strengthens solid relationships because it allows time and emotional space to give it priority, perhaps for the first time in decades. It’s the perfect opportunity to reinvent a relationship and cement your commitment for the next stage.One of the biggest myths is that retirement is a static phase during which nothing much changes. Life continues to evolve, and it’s hard to predict what’s around the corner. Each new interest can open doors and expand horizons in unexpected ways.Meanwhile, short bursts of boredom are a natural part of the transition, and they can be surprisingly fruitful if they spur people into action. One retired man currently in the post- honeymoon phase says this: “When people ask my advice about retirement, I say, get used to being bored sometimes. Because it won’t be long before something new and interesting happens.”• Not Fade Away: How To Thrive In Retirement, by Celia Dodd, is published by Green Tree at £12.99.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dea43fc765cf7848dfb24f1a6591a3d75e01bd8/0_0_5144_3086/master/5144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aaeb3b46c47a9afcca27d291864a37e","title":"dating spend love online dating","story":"From pricey cocktail bars to online dating, finding a partner can cost thousandsFor some it happens at school, for others it’s after spending several years swiping on Tinder. Finding love in this increasingly digital age has its highs and lows, but how much is it impacting our finances?At the beginning of 2018, Sarah Johnson* was on a “dating mission”. Single for four years, the analyst threw herself into online dating with the same level of gusto that someone might train for a marathon.From January to April the 35-year-old incessantly swiped in order to arrange a minimum of three dates a week sometimes it would be a first date, other times a third or fourth with the same person. “I didn’t want to focus on one person,” she admits.But with the first couple of dates usually involving cocktails at “swanky bars” with a price tag of about £15 each, Johnson is the first to admit that searching for love proved an expensive hobby. “I’d easily spend £75 in one night,” she says.After a successful couple of dates with the same person, cocktails would be upgraded to dinner or be activity-led. “I’d book mini-breaks, such as a trip to the New Forest or a night in a hotel in London,” she says. One, which involved a hotel stay, a visit to the spa, dinner and drinks, cost the Londoner more than £300. “It adds up,” she says. “But it gets boring just going for a coffee.”Earlier this year she booked a trip to Copenhagen, spending £400 on an Airbnb to celebrate the birthday of a man she had been seeing for a month. “I got overexcited because I was trying to show off,” she admits, adding that they dined at a Michelin-starred Thai restaurant, where the bill came to an eye-watering £450.Although they stopped seeing each other weeks later, Johnson insists she doesn’t regret it. “I have happy memories and had a really nice time. I travel on my own a lot, so it was nice to be with someone.” Johnson says the dating costs didn’t harm her wallet too much. “I’m lucky enough that I have a good income with disposable cash.”But the persistence paid off. She is in a relationship with a man she met on Tinder and is able to get her savings back on track. “I’m not spending as much, as I’m not doing stuff every night. It’s a nice mix of chilling at home and going out for cocktails.”With more single people than ever – there are just over 16 million singletons living in the UK, up from a little over 12 million in 2002, according to the Official for National Statistics – and a proliferation of apps, services and activities, dating is a big-bucks business. One survey, from Match and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found the average cost of a date in the UK is £129 (across both people).For others, these figures are small change. Fife-based Gareth Anderson, 29, says dating costs him about £1,000 a month after he splashes out around £200 on dinner and drinks per date, plus additional costs such as taxis and clothes.“It does tend to limit the amount I save,” says Anderson, a mechanical engineer who, up until recently, was signed up to controversial paid-for dating site BeautifulPeople (“The world’s most exclusive dating site for beautiful people only”).“I feel that the money is worth it simply for the memories and the thought of knowing that she could be ‘the one’. I’d hate to cut back and find that an impression wasn’t struck as we ended up at a Wetherspoon’s, or somewhere similar.”Anderson isn’t the only one who likes to dig deep into his pockets to find love. Many of the wealthiest singletons sign up to bespoke introduction agencies that cost from £1,000 to £100,000.Simon Manasseh, 56, has coughed up £1,795 twice for an annual subscription to dating agency Sara Eden. He says it has been worth the price tag: the first time he met a woman, that relationship lasted for two years. He rejoined last November and has been in a relationship with someone since earlier this year.Manasseh, who lives in Windsor and works as a head of aftersales, says he has used internet dating before, but adds that an agency has its advantages: “This way you get to meet people with common interests, and you know their intention.”When it comes to the first date he will often spend about £100 on dinner and drinks – and always foots the bill. “I’m a gentleman. I always pay on a first date.” He also invested £150 for some professional pictures. “If you want to do something, do it properly. It’s all about first impressions.”Despite the large sums that some daters fork out, one expert believes outlays associated with dating may have actually fallen over the years. “As now there’s a fair bit of dating going on – perhaps expectations are not as high,” says Jo Hemmings, a behavioural psychologist and dating coach, who herself charges from £200 a session. “I think people may have paid out for initial costs, like getting ready, but now it’s more relaxed. Dinner dates don’t come up quite as often – it’s more about a drink in a pub or a coffee.”Many younger millennials are choosing – or, due to increasing rents and costs, being forced – to keep dating more affordable.“My generation is more relaxed about looking for discounts. Life is so expensive in London. My feeling is that dating shouldn’t be about money – it’s about the opportunity to know someone.”* Some names and details have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/978b212fc99bfe28437f555e431cfa0168743495/0_196_3587_2152/master/3587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b81f5e072b938fb4cfbd1a72bfcba61","title":"i spend 100 a month on food for my dog he eats better than i do","story":"Fashion specialist Lucy Bishop explains why quality of life is more important than savingAfter 13 years of living in London and having to move every year from one mouse-infested flat to another, I hit a point last summer where I couldn’t take it any more. I was so fed up of living in rundown buildings with too many flatmates and dealing with greedy landlords constantly ripping you off.Saving towards a deposit for a property felt futile – it would have taken me about 100 years. Instead, I moved in the other direction and upgraded my living situation. I now live with my friend in a lovely two-bedroom flat in Bermondsey, just two minutes from my office at a vintage fashion auction house.At £850 plus bills, it’s substantially more than the £565 I was paying in Harringay, but this way I save on travel, too. I was so fed up of commuting over an hour each way. It was making me miserable.My outgoings have also shot up because of my beloved Rafiki, an ex-racing greyhound I adopted earlier this year. He eats and dresses better than I do. His gourmet all-natural frozen dog food costs about £100 a month. It might sound like a lot, but he was significantly undernourished when he moved in now his fur is radiant and his skin is in a much healthier condition. As I’m a nervous new dog mother, I spend about £50 a month on pet insurance. I worry that if I scrimp on his insurance and he injures himself, then I might land a bill I can’t afford. As I bring him to the office with me, it’s important that Rafiki is well-dressed. He wears a Hermès silk neck tie, which cost £45. I definitely have champagne taste on a beer budget – my credit card and overdraft combined comes to about £2,500. I always start my day with an oat milk flat white, which I think costs £3.50. I’ll often stop to buy another one in the afternoon. I tend to eat lunch and dinner every day in Bermondsey. I guess it sets me back about £500 a month. I never cook at home any more. I might spend £20 a week filling up a basket with items such as hummus, wine and chocolate. To mitigate all of this, I spend about £100 a month on a gym membership and ClassPass.I worry about my finances all the time. However, years of expertise in my field are starting to pay off and have drastically changed my fortunes after I spotted a rare piece of vintage which had gone unidentified in another auction. I bought it for £180, and recently sold it on for five figures. I plan to put the majority of it into a savings account – maybe into a help-to-buy scheme – and I’ll use most of the rest to pay off a credit card and my overdraft. I’ll also set aside some money to reinvest in other vintage finds.I know I should be saving every month for a property, but quality of life is more important to me. Living on my salary in London is stressful and frustrating at times – I have two hefty student loans which combined are somewhere in the region of £40,000, and expensive rent.Yes, maybe I could be saving £200 a month if I dramatically cut back on my social life, didn’t go to the gym and moved to a grim little room in Zone 4, sitting in the dark eating Pot Noodles and staring longingly at photos of dogs on the internet. But life is too short for that. Now I walk to work with my dog by my side and a cup of coffee in my hand. I consider that money well spent.As told to Suzanne Bearne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f64f568d2b63d88dd3b4f77078785ca60922698/0_0_2100_1400/master/2100.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530e8e64d65492657df2b86d51f88fa5 720w","title":"the finance curse how the outsized power of the city of london makes britain poorer","story":"The financial sector is hailed as the crowning glory of the UK economy. But as it blooms, everything else withers. By  Nicholas ShaxsonIn the 1990s, I was a correspondent for Reuters and the Financial Times in Angola, a country rich with oil and diamonds that was being torn apart by a murderous civil war. Every western visitor asked me a version of the same question: how could the citizens of a country with vast mineral wealth be so shockingly destitute?One answer was corruption: a lobster-eating, champagne-drinking elite was getting very rich in the capital while their impoverished compatriots slaughtered each other out in the dusty provinces. Another answer was that the oil and diamond industries were financing the war. But neither of these facts told the whole story.There was something else going on. Around this same time, economists were beginning to put together a new theory about what was troubling countries like Angola. They called it the resource curse.Academics had worked out that many countries with abundant natural resources seemed to suffer from slower economic growth, more corruption, more conflict, more authoritarian politics and more poverty than their peers with fewer resources. (Some mineral-rich countries, including Norway, admittedly seem to have escaped the curse.) Crucially, this poor performance wasn’t only because powerful crooks stole the money and stashed it offshore, though that was also true. The startling idea was that all this money flowing from natural resources could make their people even worse off than if the riches had never been discovered. More money can make you poorer: that is why the resource curse is also sometimes known as the Paradox of Poverty from Plenty.Back in the 1990s, John Christensen was the official economic adviser to the British tax haven of Jersey. While I was writing about the resource curse in Angola, he was reading about it, and noticing more and more parallels with what he was seeing in Jersey. A massive financial sector on the tiny island was making a visible minority filthy rich, while many Jerseyfolk were suffering extreme hardship. But he could see an even more powerful parallel: the same thing was happening in Britain. Christensen left Jersey and helped set up the Tax Justice Network, an organisation that fights against tax havens. In 2007, he contacted me, and we began to study what we called the finance curse.It may seem bizarre to compare wartorn Angola with contemporary Britain, but it turned out that the finance curse had more parallels with the resource curse than we had first imagined. For one thing, in both cases the dominant sector sucks the best-educated people out of other economic sectors, government, civil society and the media, and into high-salaried oil or finance jobs. “Finance literally bids rocket scientists away from the satellite industry,” in the words of a landmark academic study of how finance can damage growth. “People who might have become scientists, who in another age dreamt of curing cancer or flying people to Mars, today dream of becoming hedge-fund managers.”In Angola, the cascading inflows of oil wealth raised the local price levels of goods and services, from housing to haircuts. This high-price environment caused another wave of destruction to local industry and agriculture, which found it ever harder to compete with imported goods. Likewise, inflows of money into the City of London (and money created in the City of London) have had a similar effect on house prices and on local price levels, making it harder for British exporters to compete with foreign competitors.Oil booms and busts also had a disastrous effect in Angola. Cranes would festoon the Luanda skyline in good times, then would leave a residue of half-finished concrete hulks when the bust came. Massive borrowing in the good times and a buildup of debt arrears in the bad times magnified the problem. In Britain’s case, the booms and busts of finance are differently timed and mostly caused by different things. But just as with oil booms, in good times the dominant sector damages alternative economic sectors, but when the bust comes, the destroyed sectors are not easily rebuilt.To argue that the City hurts Britain’s economy might seem crazy. But research increasingly shows that all the money swirling around our oversized financial sector may actually be making us collectively poorer. As Britain’s economy has steadily become re-engineered towards serving finance, other parts of the economy have struggled to survive in its shadow, like seedlings starved of light and water under the canopy of a giant, deep-rooted and invasive tree. Generations of leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to Theresa May have believed that the City is the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, to be prioritised, pampered and protected. But the finance curse analysis shows an oversized City to be a different bird: a cuckoo in the nest, crowding out other sectors.We all need finance. We need it to pay our bills, to help us save for retirement, to redirect our savings to businesses so they can invest, to insure us against unforeseen calamities, and also sometimes for speculators to sniff out new investment opportunities in our economy. We need finance – but this tells us nothing about how big our financial centre should be or what roles it should serve.A growing body of economic research confirms that once a financial sector grows above an optimal size and beyond its useful roles, it begins to harm the country that hosts it. The most obvious source of damage comes in the form of financial crises – including the one we are still recovering from a decade after the fact. But the problem is in fact older, and bigger. Long ago, our oversized financial sector began turning away from supporting the creation of wealth, and towards extracting it from other parts of the economy. To achieve this, it shapes laws, rules, thinktanks and even our culture so that they support it. The outcomes include lower economic growth, steeper inequality, distorted markets, spreading crime, deeper corruption, the hollowing-out of alternative economic sectors and more.Newly published research makes a first attempt to assess the scale of the damage to Britain. According to a new paper by Andrew Baker of the University of Sheffield, Gerald Epstein of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Juan Montecino of Columbia University, an oversized City of London has inflicted a cumulative £4.5tn hit on the British economy from 1995-2015. That is worth around two-and-a-half years’ economic output, or £170,000 per British household. The City’s claims of jobs and tax benefits are washed away by much, much bigger harms.This £2.7tn is added to the £1.8tn, checking carefully for overlap or double-counting, to make £4.5tn. This is a first rough approximation for how much additional GDP Britons might have enjoyed if the City had been smaller, and serving its traditional useful roles. (A third, £700bn category of “excess profits” and “excess remuneration” accruing to financial players has been excluded, to be conservative.)From the 1970s onwards, finance broke decisively free of these controls, taxes were slashed and swathes of our economies were privatised. And our businesses began to undergo a dramatic transformation: their core purposes were whittled down, through ideological shifts and changes in laws and rules, to little more than a single-minded focus on maximising the wealth of shareholders, the owners of those companies. Managers often found that the best way to maximise the owners’ wealth was not to make better widgets and sprockets or to find new cures for malaria, but to indulge in the sugar rush of financial engineering, to tease out more profits from businesses that are already doing well. Social purpose be damned. As all this happened, inequality rose, financial crises became more common and economic growth fell, as managers started focusing their attentions in all the wrong places. This was misallocation, again, but the more precise term for this transformation of business and the rise of finance is “financialisation”.The best-known definition of the term comes from the American economist Gerald Epstein, a co-author of the new study cited above: financialisation is “the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies”. In other words, it is not just that financial institutions and credit have puffed up spectacularly in size since the 1970s, but also that more normal companies such as beermakers, media groups or online rail ticket services, are being “financialised”, to extract maximum wealth for their owners.Take private equity firms, for instance. They typically buy up a solid company then financially engineer that company to squeeze all its different stakeholders, one by one. They run the company’s financial operations through tax havens, fleecing taxpayers. They may squeeze workers’ pay and pensions pots, or delay paying suppliers. They might buy up several companies to dominate a market niche, then milk customers for monopoly profits. They chisel the pension funds that invest alongside them, with hidden fees. And so on.Or, consider the financial structure of Trainline, the online rail ticket seller. When you buy a ticket, you may pay a small booking fee, perhaps 75p. After leaving your bank account, that 75p takes an extraordinary financial journey. It starts with London-based Trainline Limited, then flows up to another company that owns the first, called Trainline Holdings Limited. That company is owned by another, which is owned by another and so on.Five companies up and your brave little 75p skips off to the tax haven of Jersey, then back again to London, where it passes through five more companies, then back to Jersey, then over to Luxembourg, another tax haven. Higher up still, it passes through three or more impenetrable companies in the Cayman Islands, then joins a multitude of other rivulets and streams entering the US, where, 20 or so companies after starting, it flows to KKR, a giant US investment firm.It flows onwards, to KKR’s shareholders, including banks, investment funds and billionaires. KKR owns or part-owns more than 180 real, solid companies including the car-sharing firm Lyft, Sonos audio systems and Trainline. But on top of those 180 real firms, KKR has at least 4,000 corporate entities, including more than 800 in the Cayman Islands, links in snaking chains of entities with peculiar names drawn from finance’s arcane lingo, like (in Trainline’s case) Trainline Junior Mezz Limited or Victoria Investments Intermediate Holdco Limited.This is an invisible financial superstructure, siphoning wealth from Trainline’s genuinely useful and profitable services, upwards, away and offshore. None of this is remotely illegal. In our age of financialisation, this is increasingly how business is done.In 2012, Boris Johnson, then the mayor of London, stood under an umbrella by a busy road, his blond hair whiffling in the wind. “A pound spent in Croydon is far more of value to the country from a strict utilitarian calculus than a pound spent in Strathclyde,” he gushed. “Indeed you will generate jobs and growth in Strathclyde far more effectively if you invest in Hackney or Croydon or in other parts of London.”We are back to the idea of London as the engine of the economy. Is he right? Will pampering Croydon, London and south-east England generate wealth that can then be spread out to “Strathclyde”, Scotland and the regions? Or is London the centre of a financialising machine that sucks power and money away from the peripheries? Can an oversized City of London and the rest of Britain prosper alongside each other? Or, for the regions to prosper, must the City of London be humbled? This is perhaps the defining economic question of our times. It is a question ultimately bigger than Brexit.The newly published research provides part of the answer it suggests that the power of London finance is hurting Britain, to the tune of £4.5tn.But let’s take a more fine-grained look. If Johnson thinks money flows from Croydon to “Strathclyde” (a Scottish administrative region, now abolished) he may wish to ponder the Strathclyde Police Training and Recruitment Centre, built by the construction firm Balfour Beatty and opened in 2002 under the now-notorious private finance initiative. Under PFI, instead of the government building and paying for projects such as schools or hospitals directly, they get private firms to borrow the money in the City to finance their construction, under a deal that the government will pay them back over, say, 25 years, with interest and extra goodies. (Cynics see PFI as an expensive way for successive governments to hide their borrowing and spending, by outsourcing it all to the private sector.)The training centre (now called simply the Police Scotland Training Centre) sits underneath a corporate latticework nearly as complex as Trainline’s. PFI payments flow from the government to a private special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Strathclyde Limited Partnership then flow upwards from it through 10 or so companies or partnerships, to a £2bn Guernsey-based firm called International Public Partnerships Limited (INPP), then onwards via tangled shareholdings, partnerships, banking and lending arrangements, and lawyers and accountants clipping fees along the way, to other people and firms in London, South Africa, New York, Texas, Jersey, Munich, Ontario and more. The pipework is complex but the overall pattern is clear. Money flows from police budgets in Scotland, up through these financialised pipelines and into the City, posh parts of London and the south-east and offshore. Along the way, profits are being made and distributed and tax is avoided.But there is a bigger issue than tax here. Treasury data shows that while the police training centre cost £17-18m to build, the flow of payments to the PFI consortium will add up to £112m from 2001 to 2026, well over six times as much, and vastly more than what the government would have spent if it had simply borrowed that much itself and paid Balfour Beatty directly to build it. This fits a wider pattern. The 700-odd PFI schemes in Britain had an estimated capital value of less than £59.1bn in 2017, yet taxpayers will end up paying out more than £308bn for them, well over five times that sum. PFI is a gift to the City which has resulted in, as the PFI expert Allyson Pollock acidly put it, “one hospital for the price of two”.I have looked at several PFI corporate structures: each has a similarly convoluted financial architecture, and each involves a rain of payments from British regions (including poorer parts of London) into this central-London-focused financial nexus, overseas and offshore. And PFI is just one component of a larger picture. About £240bn, a third of the UK government’s annual budget, now goes on privately run but taxpayer-funded public services, most of it run through similarly financialised, London-focused pipelines.On this evidence, Johnson’s picture of money flowing from Croydon to Strathclyde has it exactly back to front. These are examples of what the late geographer Doreen Massey called the “colonial relationship” between parts of London and the rest of the country. To visualise what is going on, I like to imagine old white men in top hats manipulating a Heath-Robinson-like contraption of spindly pipework perched on top of the economy, vacuuming up coins and notes and IOUs from the pockets of those underneath: the workers and users of private care homes, sexual abuse referral centres, schools, hospitals, prisons – and, of course, those of us paying mortgages on expensive homes. All are unconsciously paying tribute into this great invisible extractive machinery.It is true, of course, that a chunk of the City’s money comes from overseas, so is not extracted from Britain. That at least must be a net benefit, surely? Not so. The core value of finance to our economy comes not from the jobs and billionaires it creates, but from the services it provides. Bringing in enormous quantities of overseas wealth doesn’t provide useful services for the British economy – but it does increase the power and wealth of the finance sector, contributing to the brain drain, the economic crises, the crashing productivity, the predatory attitudes, the misdirected lending and the subsequent inequality. Our open arms to the world’s dirty money is corrupting our politics, and it is puffing up our housing markets, penalising the young, the poor and the weak. It is all deepening the finance curse.Finance is a great geographical sorting machine, iding us into offshore winners and onshore losers. But it is also a sorting machine for race, gender, disability and vulnerability – taking value from those suffering reduced public services or wage cuts, and from groups made up disproportionately of women, non-white people, the elderly and the vulnerable – and delivering it to the City. It is a generational sorting machine too, as PFI, risky shadow banking profits and financialised games help the winners to jam today, with the bills sent to our kids.This hidden tide of money flows constantly from the tired, the weak, the vulnerable huddled masses across Britain, up through these invisible filigree pipelines to a relatively small number of white European or North American men in Mayfair, Chelsea, Jersey, Geneva, the Caymans or New York. This is the finance curse in action. And it’s nice work if you can get it.Why can’t we do something about the overwhelming power of finance? Why are the protests so muted? Why can’t we tax, regulate or police City institutions properly?We can’t, and we don’t, not just because the City’s money talks so loudly, but also because of an ideology that has bamboozled us into thinking that we must be “competitive”. The City is going head to head with other financial centres around the world, they cry, and if we are to stay ahead in this race, we cannot hold it back with tough regulations, clod-hopping police snooping around, or “uncompetitive” tax rates. Otherwise, all that money will whoosh off to Geneva or Hong Kong. After Brexit, it will be even more urgent to stay competitive.“We must be competitive” – it sounds great, right? Tony Blair embraced this concept, even before he slammed the Financial Services Authority in 2005, saying it was seen as “hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly respectable companies that have never defrauded anyone”. David Cameron bowed down to this competitiveness agenda when he declared that “We are in a global race today... Sink or swim. Do or decline.” Theresa May reiterated the idea last month when she declared that Britain would be “unequivocally pro-business” with the lowest corporate tax rate among G20 countries.Many people in Britain, it is true, are ambivalent about all this. They rightly fret that the City is a global money-laundering paradise, harming other nations, but (whisper it quietly) they like the hot money and oligarchs it attracts to our shores. There is a trade-off, they think, between doing the right thing and preserving our prosperity. Some do understand that if other countries follow suit with this competitiveness agenda, a race to the bottom ensues, leading to ever-lower corporate taxes, laxer financial regulation, greater secrecy, looser controls on financial crime and so on. The only answer to a race to the bottom, they gloomily conclude, is to agree some sort of multilateral armistice to get countries to co-operate and collaborate in not doing this stuff. But that is like herding squirrels on a trampoline: each country wants to out-compete the others, so there will be cheating on any deal. And it is hard to mobilise voters on this complex, distant global stuff. So, they sigh, we are stuck in this ugly race to the bottom.But there is some tremendous good news here: these people are all flat wrong. The competitiveness agenda, driving us into this race, is intellectual nonsense resting on elementary fallacies, lazy assumptions and confusions. And this is for a few simple reasons. For one thing, economies, tax systems and cities are nothing like companies, and don’t compete like we might think. To get a taste of this, ponder the difference between a failed company, such as Carillion, and a failed state, such as Syria. Even more to the point, the finance curse shows us that if too much finance harms your economy, then pursuing more finance through the competitiveness agenda will make things worse.Underpinning all this is the fallacy of composition, whereby the fortunes of our big businesses and big banks are conflated with the fortunes of our whole economy. Making HSBC or RBS more globally competitive, the thinking goes, will make Britain more competitive. But to the extent that their profits are extracted from other parts of the British economy, their success hurts Britain more than it helps.What could Britain do with that £16bn? We could simultaneously run nine Oxford Universities, double the resources of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, treble government cybersecurity resources, and double staff numbers at HMRC, the tax authorities. Or we could send nearly half a million kids to Eton each year, if you could fit them all in. Does this trade-off somehow make Britain’s tax system, or Britain itself, more competitive? Of course not.Corporate tax cuts are in fact just one of many varieties of goodies that we shower on the mobile financiers and multinationals. The same basic arguments hold in other areas, too. Better financial regulation brings benefits, while also scaring away the wealth-extracting predators. It is a win-win. There is no trade-off.Words such as competitiveness and related terms (such as the even more fatuous UK Plc) are wielded to trick millions of taxpayers into thinking that it is in their own self-interest to hand over goodies – tax cuts, financial deregulation, tolerance for monopolies, turning a blind eye to crime and more – to large multinationals and financial institutions. We are permanently at a tipping point, we are told: all that investment is about to disappear down a gurgling global plughole unless we cut taxes and deregulate, NOW, I tell you.We need investment that is embedded in the local economy, bringing jobs, skills and long-term engagement, where managers send their kids to local schools and the business supports an ecosystem of local supply chains. This is the golden stuff, and if an investment is nicely embedded, a whiff of tax won’t scare it away (even if Brexit might). Any investor who is more sensitive to tax has, almost by definition, shallower roots. So taxes will tend to discourage the flightier, more predatory, more financialised investors, who bring fewer jobs and local linkages, and higher corporate tax revenues pay for ingredients that attract investors: roads, police forces, courts, and the educated and healthy workers. To prosper, Britain should increase its effective corporate tax rates, at least for financiers and large multinationals.Of course, you could also argue that the best way to become more competitive would be for a country to invest in and upgrade education or infrastructure, control dangerous capital flows across borders, manage the exchange rate, or carefully target industrial policies to nurture productive domestic economic ecosystems. You could insist that something called “national competitiveness” must meet the test of productivity, good jobs and a broad-based rise in living standards. There are respectable arguments along all these lines.But these are not the visions that Blair, Cameron, May, Trump and other finance-captured leaders have been pushing. Their competitiveness agenda is about pursuing rootless global capital in a dog-eat-dog world. Give big banks and multinationals the goodies, and look the other way when they behave badly, in the craven and pathetic hope that they won’t run away.Any country engaging in a race to the bottom on this stuff also needs to understand that the race does not stop when tax rates reach zero. There is literally no limit to the extent to which corporate players and the wealthy wish to free-ride off the taxes paid by the rest of us. Eliminate their taxes, appease them, and they will demand other subsidies, like the playground bully. Why wouldn’t they?And yet your local car wash, your barber, or your last surviving neighbourhood fruit-and-veg merchant can’t credibly threaten to jump to Monaco if they don’t like their tax rates or fruit hygiene regulations. The agenda favours the mobile big players with handouts, leaving the domestic small fry to pay the full price of civilisation – plus a surcharge to cover the roaming members of the billionaire classes who won’t. The agenda systematically shifts wealth upwards from poor to rich, distorting our economies, reducing growth and undermining our democracies. It is always harmful.The competitiveness agenda is a billionaire-friendly hoax. Most competent economists know this already. “If we can teach undergraduates to wince when they hear someone talk about competitiveness, we will have done our nation a great service,” the US economist Paul Krugman explained in a 1993 paper. “A government wedded to the ideology of competitiveness,” he later added, “is as unlikely to make good economic policy as a government committed to creationism is to make good science policy.”So the competitiveness agenda is an intellectual house of cards, ready to fall. If we can topple it, we can tackle the finance curse. It is pretty straightforward, in fact. In the 1983 movie War Games, a computer geek hacks into the US Department of Defense’s supercomputer and gets dragged into a game of strategy called Global Thermonuclear War. As the game merges with reality, the machine races through thousands of scenarios before concluding: “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” Britain is in the same position. By joining this “competitive” global race we have not only been beggaring others – we have been beggaring ourselves, too. We can, and we must, simply step out of the race, unilaterally. That last word, unilaterally, is key. We can just stop it. This is a race for losers.We need not bow down to the demands of monopolists, foreign oligarchs, tax-haven operators, wealth-extracting private equity moguls, too-big-to-jail banks, or PFI milkers. We can tax, regulate and police our financial sector as we ought to. Global coordination and cooperation are worth doing where possible, but we need not wait for it. And by appealing to national self-interest, we can mobilise the biggest constituency of all, and put finance back in its rightful place: serving Britain’s people, not served by them.Adapted from The Finance Curse: How Global Finance Is Making Us All Poorer by Nicholas Shaxson, published by Vintage on 11 October and available from bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c0e8ef9f6a2018959c4dce66b543dcb8ab38ddb/0_162_4840_3352/master/4840.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d7b7090053f09606bb87b0ba79a35194 960w","title":"conservatives wont chuck theresa may before brexit next march","story":"Boris Johnson does not have enough supporters to replace the prime minister, believes Downing StreetEven before Theresa May danced her self-deprecating way on to the stage in Birmingham this week, most of her party were resigned to the fact that however little they may love her, there is little to be gained from chucking her aside before Brexit next March.One leave-backing cabinet minister told the  that May was a “vehicle for Brexit”, and she was likely to step down shortly afterwards another suggested the optimal time to replace her would be in 2021, a year before the next general election is due.And while Boris Johnson drew a huge crowd for his “chuck Chequers” speech, he didn’t go as far as to call on his supporters to depose the prime minister. Downing Street remains convinced that he doesn’t have the numbers, at least for now.Johnson\u0026nbspsays in a long-awaited statement\u0026nbspthat \u0027after a huge amount of heartache\u0027 he will​ back the leave campaign. In January, David Cameron had announced ministers could campaign on either side, and despite being a backbencher, Johnson\u0027s view was seen as influential.Johnson campaigns around the UK, posing with the now infamous bus saying leaving the EU would provide the NHS with an extra £350m a week – a\u0026nbspclaim later condemned\u0026nbspas a misuse of statistics.After Cameron quits, Johnson\u0026nbspannounces he will contest\u0026nbspthe Conservative leadership, pitching himself as a unifier. In a surprise twist, Michael Gove\u0026nbspsays he will also stand, warning that Johnson cannot provide the leadership needed. This\u0026nbspprompts Johnson\u0026nbspto use the launch of his leadership bid to say he will no longer stand.Theresa May, who took over the leadership unopposed, appoints Johnson as foreign secretary.Labour MPs call for Johnson to step down after\u0026nbsphe wrongly states that\u0026nbspNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was jailed in Iran, was \u0027teaching people journalism\u0027 – something both her family and her employer said was untrue, and was used by Iranian officials to justify her detention.Johnson is among 29 ministers who discuss May’s plan for Brexit at Chequers. He\u0026nbspagrees to her proposals, though it is later reported he had initial doubts.After vanishing for several hours,\u0026nbspJohnson resigns.\u0026nbspJames Duddridge, the MP for Rochford and Southend, made headlines on Wednesday morning by announcing that he had written a letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful backbench 1922 committee, demanding a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.If 48 such letters are submitted, Brady would be obliged to arrange a vote among the party’s MPs. If May lost, she would be barred from standing in the subsequent leadership contest – and cast out of Downing Street.Yet Duddridge is perhaps best known in Westminster for attempting to lead a bid to depose John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, which ultimately gained little support.Other MPs who have publicly claimed to have sent their own letters include inveterate critics of the leadership, Nadine Dorries and Andrew Bridgen.But many others, even those who are deeply sceptical about May’s brand of Toryism, believe she deserves the right to pursue the Brexit negotiations to their conclusion – and some were encouraged by the one-nation vision set out in her speech.Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, said he was encouraged that the prime minister appeared to have returned to some of the concerns she set out when she first arrived in Downing Street. “I liked it,” he said of her speech. “Not everything was there that I would like, but there was the signposting: on social justice, on cost of living, on housing. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, but I am encouraged.”Other MPs simply fear that opening up the leadership question might yield an answer they like even less than May.Scottish Conservatives feel so strongly about the need to avoid handing the reins to Johnson that they have reportedly launched a bid, nicknamed “Operation Arse”, to stop him.Asked about May’s leadership, friends and enemies single out the same quality – resilience. “She’s the great survivor,” said Anna Soubry, the former minister who has been a consistent critic of May’s approach to Brexit.As negotiations with the EU27 reach their endgame in the coming weeks, that resilience will be sorely tested.May and her team are braced for a gruelling set of discussions: with EU leaders, with her parliamentary partners in the DUP, and with the European Commission, all the while withstanding ferocious friendly fire.Meanwhile, some of May’s cabinet colleagues believe it is vital to keep alive the plan B of a looser, Canada-style arrangement – in spite of the fact that it fails to solve the Irish border problem.One of Johnson’s aims in launching such a ferocious public attack on the prime minister’s plans was to try to influence the decision-making inside cabinet and some Brexiters insist May faces a greater threat from her colleagues around the table in Downing Street, than from restive backbenchers.“There’s a general mood in cabinet of, we’ll give her one last chance to make progress then we – to coin a phrase – take back control,” said one.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, offered his support to the prime minister’s approach on Friday – but only on the basis that the Brexit deal could be revisited later. “We should try to get as much of a final deal as we can get by 29 March, but it’s self-evident that if it’s a bilateral treaty, it can be revised later on,” he told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Philip Hammond’s task in drawing up his 29 October budget became significantly harder after the prime minister promised in her speech that a decade of austerity will end after Brexit.Any spending increases would not be expected to kick in until next year’s spending review in any event but it will be hard for the chancellor to avoid a shift of tone, after her upbeat rhetoric about voters’ sacrifices paying off.Meanwhile, Brexit hardliners are prepared to resume the guerrilla parliamentary tactics they deployed against the government before the summer recess – potentially including, they claim, amending or even rejecting the budget, if it includes tax rises or other measures they don’t like.But as to the question of whether the number of no-confidence letters from Tory MPs is about to hit the magic 48, Brady suggested at a fringe meeting in Birmingham that it was wise to be wary.“The distance between what some of my colleagues say they might have done and what they actually have done can be considerable,” he said. “There are instances where I will see a Conservative colleague on the television saying they have written a letter to me when they haven’t. I will see them on the television saying they had withdrawn the letter to me, when they haven’t sent it in the first place. You have to be careful what you believe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4c29890c2f1b00e1bea4255ffa663f486b1476/0_80_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f291449c9b3468adfb1eb03c6719ee26","title":"may secretly woos key labour mps to back her brexit deal","story":"Senior Tories press ‘national interest’ case for supporting PM to avoid no-deal outcome Theresa May has drawn up plans for a secret charm offensive aimed at persuading dozens of Labour MPs to back her Brexit deal even if it costs Jeremy Corbyn the chance to be prime minister, the  has learned.Senior Conservatives say they have already been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs over a period of several months, making the case that the national interest in avoiding a no-deal outcome is more important than forcing a general election by defeating the government on May’s Brexit deal.Now, with talks in Brussels entering their frantic final phase, the prime minister and her party whips are stepping up efforts to win backing for a compromise deal that one minister described as a “British blancmange”.They are convinced they will need Labour votes to win, after a fractious Tory conference in Birmingham, at which determined opponents of the prime minister’s approach, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, won plaudits for saying they would vote against it.One Tory source compared the challenge of striking a deal with the EU27 that would satisfy both sides of his own party to “landing a jumbo jet on the penalty spot”.Labour MPs will thus be the focus of intense lobbying, in the period between May returning from Brussels with a Brexit deal and the meaningful vote, which is expected to come about a fortnight later.Conservative whips are rehearsing an argument, the outlines of which were clear in the prime minister’s conference speech, that the deal on offer is a pragmatic one.One cabinet member identified a string of Labour MPs they thought would take a “reasoned approach”, such as Chris Bryant, Rachel Reeves and Lucy Powell, politicians who have been critical of Corbyn in the past.Bryant, a remainer, said he had not had any discussions with the government and would only be able to vote for a deal if May shifted towards Labour’s position of backing a customs union. Reeves said she had no intention of backing the government. Privately, some Labour MPs believe at least 15 of their colleagues could vote with the government, rather than appear to their constituents to be trying to “block Brexit”, with up to 30, including some frontbenchers, prepared to abstain, rather than go through the voting lobbies with hardliners such as Rees-Mogg.James Cleverly, the Conservative deputy chairman, has been liaising with some in this group.May appealed directly to Labour backbenchers in her conference speech when she spoke of the “heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, saying they were on the backbenches, not in the shadow cabinet of what she called the “Jeremy Corbyn party”.She also told the party faithful that her deal “keeps faith with the British people” and was in the national interest. And she pointed to Sajid Javid’s announcement of a tougher migration regime as evidence that her approach delivers on the referendum result by ending the free movement of people.Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to help May build a majority by offering Downing Street a written commitment to think again on “frictionless trade” if the UK changes its red lines after it leaves the bloc.EU leaders want to throw the prime minister a lifeline in the long-awaited political declaration on a future deal, a first draft of which is expected to emerge next week.If she clinches a deal with her EU counterparts in the face of formidable odds, May’s team believe the national mood will shift in her favour.And they hope a positive bounce from the financial markets will help to convince some Labour MPs to hold their noses and back a deal based on Chequers – though she did not use the word Chequers itself in her speech.Senior Conservatives have also been stressing the aspects of May’s approach that Boris Johnson and other hard Brexiters object to – including signing up to EU regulations in key areas.Tory whips are also working on persuading a separate group of MPs from leave-voting constituencies, such as Caroline Flint, from Don Valley, and Gareth Snell, from Stoke-on-Trent Central.Labour’s official policy is to reject any final deal that does not meet six tests drawn up by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, one of which is that it must offer the “exact same benefits” as membership of the single market and customs union.Corbyn said in his conference speech that if the prime minister shifted her position on a customs union, and promised to uphold environmental regulation and workers’ rights, Labour could swing behind her. But his party is keen to secure the opportunity of pushing for a general election by voting down the deal.A Labour source said: “Labour has been clear from the outset that if Theresa May’s Brexit deal does not meet our six tests then we will vote against it in parliament.” He added: “The Tories are wrong to say it’s a choice between Theresa May’s deal or no deal. No deal is simply not a viable option. There is no majority in parliament to take the UK off a cliff in March 2019.”The tight parliamentary arithmetic and the likelihood of a rebellion by the Tory right means that Labour votes will be vital, at least as an insurance policy, while having the additional benefit of encouraging a split within Labour.But Conservative estimates vary as to how many of their own MPs would rebel in such a high-stakes vote. Losing it could unleash a constitutional crisis.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, has suggested as many as 80 Tory rebels could vote against the prime minister, but Tory whips hope to “burn off” the majority, reducing them to around 10 diehards.The government is also expected to argue that, while it will be possible to amend the final motion put before parliament, there is not enough time to delay article 50 and hold a referendum before the Brexit date of 29 March, because both would require primary legislation.However, that has been disputed by second referendum campaigners who say the EU’s 27 member states would be willing to extend article 50 to give time for the UK to legislate for and hold a referendum if it were called for by parliament in the autumn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d2673c2a00d9bd4e6b03c75da74b8c940d6048/0_330_3451_2071/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad4eb9e446d1d3ba26ec30d99085c6d","title":"stars line up to pay coach travel to brexit peoples vote march","story":"Delia Smith and Sir Patrick Stewart join political figures to help supporters get to LondonTV chef Delia Smith, the singer Olly Alexander and the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine are among public figures contributing to the cost of coach travel to a march calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.They have agreed to pay more than £1,000 each for buses taking supporters from across the country to the “people’s vote” demonstration in London on 20 October.Others sponsors include the actors Sir Patrick Stewart and Natascha McElhone, the millionaire co-founder of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton, the author Ian McEwan, the former foreign secretary David Miliband and his former Labour government colleague Peter Mandelson.Alexander, the lead singer of the Years \u0026amp Years, who is paying for travel from the Forest of Dean, is urging young people to turn out in force.“This is our future we are talking about, and we have to be able to have a say. The will of the people can change, and I believe it has as we have watched the mess unfold,” he said.Campaigners are hoping more than 1 million people will show up for the march, which takes place two days after the scheduled deadline for the Brexit deal to be signed with the EU.A second referendum can only be held after legislation is passed, and it is opposed by Theresa May, who has repeatedly said her duty is to deliver the result of the vote on 23 June 2016.Experts have said it would be difficult to hold a another referendum before 29 March, the scheduled day for the UK to leave the EU. But this has not deterred campaigners who point out the process could be shortened or the leave date moved until the public has been given a vote on the final deal.The Conservative remainer Anna Soubry, MP for Broxtowe, is among those funding a bus to the demonstration, as well as Lord Heseltine, who served under Margaret Thatcher and was later one of the driving forces behind the creation of the single market in 1993.Rebel Tory MP Philip Lee is paying for a bus from his constituency of Bracknell.Smith is sponsoring a bus from Norwich, where she is joint majority shareholder in the city’s football team.The historian Dan Snow is paying for a coach from Southampton, while Stewart is sponsoring one from his home town of Huddersfield.Smith said, “I am petrified at the way Brexit is going. I’m afraid the political leaders have made a dog’s dinner of it and none of us really trust them any more to take final decision – whatever the result of the negotiations.” Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former director of communications who is an adviser to the People’s Vote campaign, is funding a bus from his hometown of Burnley. He said: “In her conference speech Theresa May dismissed the people’s vote as a campaign by politicians. Not for the first time, she is totally misreading the mood of the country. It is not a politicians’ campaign – if only.“This is a movement of people of all backgrounds and all regions who see Brexit going wrong and want a say on the outcome of the negotiations, whether there is a deal or not. And the fact she felt the need to mention it at all shows how far we have come in so short a time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63edc61a5ef2f2f3bdbd017f55622bcd945a4f5c/254_234_5506_3304/master/5506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42827cb3ca4749b64955d683b2cb04d","title":"the woman who sued over i needed to speak up","story":"‘I had to be brave,’ says Miss M, who fought on after a not proven verdict in the high courtMiss M was an intern for an English police force working with victims of domestic violence when she realised she needed to continue fighting over what happened to her.It was 2016. A few months earlier, a high court jury near Edinburgh had cleared Stephen Coxen of raping her while she was too drunk to realise or resist after a freshers’ week party at St Andrews University. If the women she was working with had the resolve to report violence and rape, Miss M reasoned, she had to show the same courage.“I had always wanted to join the police but if I worked with people brave and strong enough to come forward, I had to be brave enough myself and take this forward. Something had happened it was not right and I needed to speak up about it,” she said.Backed by lawyers with the Scottish Women’s Rights Centre and Rape Crisis Scotland, Miss M took the rare step of launching a private civil action against Coxen. For the first time in Scotland since 1926, someone cleared of rape in a criminal trial was being sued for damages.A civil case requires a lower standard of proof than in a criminal case, with a judge sitting without a jury making a decision on the balance of probabilities.Over two weeks in June this year in Edinburgh sheriff court, Miss M again relived the trauma of the night of 13-14 September 2013 in St Andrews when, like tens of thousands of students across the UK, she had been celebrating the start of the academic year.She heard toxicologists tot up and debate her alcohol consumption: the cider, rosé wine, champagne and vodka. Psychologists discussed her post-traumatic stress disorder, her blackouts, the sleepless nights and bouts of depression which followed that night. The court heard expert testimony about the wound to her mouth caused when Coxen forced her to have oral sex the violence of the rape, she said, left blood stains across the bed and a nearby wall.Coxen again took the stand, to deny raping her. He insisted she had willingly walked home she had willingly kissed him at the nightclub. Yet despite the medical evidence, he denied any oral rape. He gave a hazy explanation of how her mobile phone came into his possession, which was disputed by other witnesses. His account of being let into Miss M’s home by a flatmate was also flatly contradicted.Having already given her account of that night to the police, a court, medical experts and lawyers, Miss M was required to give it again. In a civil action, both the litigant and the respondent can watch each other testify.Miss M had steeled herself for her own testimony but her resolve broke when Coxen recounted how he had recoiled in revulsion at seeing her bleeding. She fled the court, her pain audible from the corridor outside.In the event, Coxen was simply not believed. Sheriff Robert Weir QC made clear he believed Miss M’s account: her lawyer, Simon di Rollo, “invited me to conclude that the evidence for the pursuer was compelling and persuasive. I agree with that characterisation of the evidence.”When her decision to pursue Coxen for damages was first reported earlier this year, she recalls reading comments online describing her as a “gold-digging whore”. She has already funded part of the case herself and is highly unlikely to see any of the £80,000 damages agreed by the court: if Coxen can ever afford to pay, the money will be taken back by the Scottish Legal Aid Board to cover the costs of her case before anything left goes to her.Miss M believes large parts of her case were never properly heard at the criminal trial, which she says was rushed through by the Scottish prosecution service without proper preparation. In her civil action, she had control over what happened, and had the time to prepare properly. The witness evidence also helped her remember, and make sense of, that night.“The civil process has allowed me to understand what happened for parts of that evening I didn’t know everything that had happened. It’s only going through the civil process that I have had the answers and provided me the opportunity to have proper help now,” she said.Miss M has since had a job offer from that police force in England. She hopes to start her training soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68511dfdebd5ddf62962d7700bf415fdfef4e751/168_8_3791_2275/master/3791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c256e9020199b6671b7e9790e0ecc3","title":"bath exeter premiership match report","story":"• Bath 24-39 Exeter• Exeter run in five tries after close-fought first halfBy the final whistle Todd Blackadder’s cunning plan had turned to chaos but to fault Bath for this defeat does not do justice to Exeter’s ruthless edge. They march towards Europe with a sixth win from their opening six matches and another bonus point to boot.Already there is a growing sense that they and Saracens are streets ahead of the rest and, if there is any solace for Bath, it is that after playing both in six days they do not have to do so again for a while.If last week was Bath’s B team, the As at least made a game of it for an hour. Blackadder wants to make the Rec “a fortress” and the commitment, led by Zach Mercer, was impressive. But the Chiefs weathered it and found a gear in the final quarter well beyond their hosts as all the while Gareth Steenson marshalled his troops superbly.Another five tries, including three in the last 20 minutes, send them top of the table with Saracens slipping to second – that is a tussle likely to end up at Twickenham. “I can’t speak highly enough of the players for the way they stood up and took hold of the situation in the second half,” said Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter.Whether it is considered waving the white flag or shrewd management of resources, Blackadder has been defiant in the face of criticism for making so many changes last weekend, then recalling the cavalry.There is nothing to say he cannot do so – determining anyone’s strongest side is subjective – but to be vindicated Blackadder needed, if not victory against Exeter, then a performance to carry Bath into the Champions Cup double header. He could hardly have asked for more in the opening quarter. Consecutive crunching tackles from Dave Attwood and then Talupe Faletau ensured Exeter’s first siege of Bath’s line was resisted and had the Rec rocking. Bath cleared their lines and continued their bright start with the opening points – Freddie Burns on target with a penalty after Harry Williams had infringed.Semesa Rokoduguni, furious with himself for a fumble when well placed, made amends a few minutes later, kicking ahead after a sharp passing move had opened space on the right. Priestland was supporting and gathered for a clean run under the posts and Burns’ conversion made for a 10-0 lead. It was already clear, however, that Exeter had the ascendancy at the scrum and in what can be considered a compliment to Bath considering how few penalties the Chiefs have kicked at goal this season, Steenson pointed to the posts and duly put his side on the board.Within moments the Chiefs were level. Stu Townsend must be commended for his interception and run to the line but Burns’ pass was dreadful – the Exeter scrum-half already waiting to receive the ball gratefully. Burns added another penalty after a bludgeoning run from Tom Dunn but Exeter led when Don Armand powered over in the right corner after collecting Steenson’s grubber.Burns and Steenson exchanged penalties early in the second half before Rokoduguni was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on. Santiago Cordero’s pass was heading for the arms of Phil Dollman outside him and there is no doubting Rokoduguni’s touch took it away from him.Bath resisted – indeed they did so until Rokoduguni was back on the field, having nosed 19-18 ahead with another Burns penalty – but a barrage of Exeter penalties and lineouts ensued. Bath managed to stem the flow but they could not hold back the tide and after the referee, Christophe Ridley, consulted with the TMO, a try was eventually awarded to Matt Kvesic. By this stage, the Chiefs’ tails were up and an arcing run from Jack Nowell prised open the space for Ian Whitten to score the decisive try.To compound matters for Bath, Faletau went off with an arm injury and shortly Henry Slade’s breakaway run led to Nowell adding try No 5 for the Chiefs. Chris Cook’s late try for Bath was a beauty, spotting space inside and carving his way inside it, but it was small consolation – a long way short of vindication. “In parts we played really well and I thought we put in a massive defensive performance,” said Blackadder. “But it was the little tiny moments which cost us and Exeter were very clinical and took their opportunities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb57f0c00355edf23f60e28d649f35cb2c70f45/260_6_3516_2109/master/3516.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=949c2750e9dd7624fe97ced4f7665cc4","title":"james doyle starve weight sea of class prix de larc de triomphe weigh in horse racing","story":"T he only thing I can compare it to really is when I see boxers and UFC fighters that drop down a weight ision,” James Doyle says, as he looks ahead to the moment when he weighs out for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe on Sunday.“You don’t want to dehydrate yourself too much, but you are going to be dehydrated for a little period of time and so you want to keep that as short as possible. That’s what they do, they lose the last little bit just before the weigh-in and then they put it back on straight after.” He pauses, and smiles. “Unfortunately,” he adds, “we don’t have the luxury of weighing in, and then going straight off and filling up.”Instead, having weighed out at 8st 9lb, three pounds below what would usually be his absolute minimum, Doyle will need to steer a half-ton racehorse – the second favourite, Sea Of Class – from a difficult draw around one of the most challenging tracks in the game. Only then will the pressure be off.Yet as Doyle discusses his pre-race regime and his big chance to win Europe’s most prestigious prize, it has to be said that there is little sign of pressure. His disposition is – typically – as warm as the afternoon at Salisbury racecourse, where he has just ridden the 130th winner of what is already the best season of his career. Some jockeys turn into surly, hollow-cheeked ghosts when they are wasting to make a low weight, but Doyle is not one of them.“I’ve not really thought about it,” he says. “I ride at close to my minimum most days, so if you have to dip below, it’s not like I want to be walking around at 8st 9lb now. You want to leave it as late as possible and trim the last little bit off just before the race. It’s something I used to be worried about when I was a lot younger, and I didn’t quite understand the body and how certain things work, but as you get a bit older you start to learn what works well with you and what doesn’t, the things that you can eat happily and the stuff that you can only have every now and again. It’s just trial and error really.”Doyle is 5ft 9in tall, and every inch the professional, modern jockey. A quarter of a century ago, he would have towered over every other rider in the weighing room. Even Lester Piggott – famously dubbed the “Long Fellow” – is 5ft 8in. But times, and attitudes, have changed, both towards diet and, in particular, the view that six or seven rides a day is as much of a workout as a rider needs. Fitness regimes have helped jockeys to exert more control over their metabolism.“I’ve got my own gym, hot tub and spa at home and a personal trainer I train with three times a week,” Doyle says. “This week I’ve done a bit extra to what I’d normally do. I’ve got an air assault bike, which does exactly what it says, really. It’s a proper assault bike, 30 minutes on that really sorts you out.“I can pretty much tell without jumping on the scales what weight I would be, from silly things like whether I’ve got my watch on. You can feel it, it can fluctuate a bit and when I was younger it used to fluctuate a hell of a lot more than it does now, but I’ll ride at 9st every day, dip to 8st 12lb for the odd good one, and obviously 8st 9lb for one that’s once in a lifetime.”Sea Of Class, clearly, is very much in that category. She has won her last two races, both at the highest level of the sport, with a withering burst of speed in the final furlong. The anticipated fast ground at Longchamp on Sunday will suit her perfectly and like four of the last 10 winners, Sea Of Class is a three-year-old filly, getting weight from all but one of her opponents.Enable, a three-year-old herself when she won the race at Chantilly last year, will head the market on Sunday, but Sea Of Class has all the attributes that could be necessary to beat the favourite.“It’s the biggest race in Europe and it would be a dream to win it. I’ve talked to Frankie about it in the past and he says there’s no other feeling like it, passing the line in the Arc is just the absolute ultimate for us in Europe. I’m fortunate enough to have ridden in it four times and it was amazing to have been part of the race, never mind actually going there with a sneaky feeling that you could be the winner.”6.00am Wake up6.15am Breakfast: a few oats, a bit of yoghurt, fruit6.30am Air assault bike, 30 minutes7.00am Sweat in hot tub9.00am Fly to Paris11.30am Arrive Longchamp\u0026nbsp11.45am Sauna3.05pm Ride Sea Of Class in the Arc"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3bf0da9bd06112e94f02833346f41aec1995f88/385_147_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffd5419438b9de1bf5100d06350d07ae","title":"sebastian vettel lewis hamilton f1 juggernaut japanese gp","story":"Last season the Japanese Grand Prix played host to the dramatic conclusion of a trilogy of races that left Sebastian Vettel’s title hopes shattered and Ferrari shell-shocked.So strong for so long in the Formula One championship, the German was forced to endure a torturous collapse as Lewis Hamilton took a huge lead at Suzuka. The Mercedes driver sealed the title two races later in Mexico. Now back in Japan, Vettel is once again barely clinging on to his challenge, an experience that will be all the more painful second time around.He had led the title race last year until the 13th round at Monza but he came to Suzuka on the back of a misjudgment in Singapore that caused him to crash and an engine replacement in Malaysia that forced him to start at the back from where he could manage only fourth place. By Japan he was 34 points in arrears. Nothing short of victory was required but an almost unheard of misfortune sealed his fate. A spark plug failure ended his race after four laps, Hamilton won and took an almost unassailable 59-point lead.Vettel’s position is now, if anything, even worse. The pressure is greater and Hamilton is in the form of his life. He holds a 50-point lead, accrued over five wins from the past six races against a stronger Ferrari car. Even now, in his 12th season and with four titles, Hamilton has perhaps surprised himself with his ascent to another level in the mastery of his craft.“I am really happy. When I look back at a lot of these races I couldn’t have hoped for better performances,” he said. “There have been some real dream experiences, races where I would dream of performing at those levels. That’s what I live for.”Vettel took the disappointment last season well. He admitted Ferrari could not keep up with Mercedes in the final third of the title race so knew the odds were against him. Now there is no such comfort. What has made Hamilton’s run so exceptional is that he has achieved it against a driver who had the advantage of a quicker car. Hamilton has executed almost to perfection but Vettel and Ferrari, with their best shot at the championship in a decade, have been left to rue errors that are likely to leave them empty-handed.Hamilton’s form has allowed no breathing space and the past six races make for painful reading at Ferrari. Hamilton’s run in Germany, to win in the rain from 14th, was huge and in contrast to the mistake that led to Vettel crashing. Pole in the wet in Hungary proved vital to the win in the next round for Hamilton who, when then outpaced at Spa, ensured he minimised the damage with second place.At Ferrari’s home race at Monza Vettel crashed into Hamilton, who was passing him. The German’s spin meant he finished fourth as Hamilton took the flag. Then in Singapore, where a Ferrari fightback was expected, Hamilton simply turned the screw. His qualifying lap at Marina Bay was possibly the best of his career and unmatchable. He converted it to a win and it was followed by another in Russia when Mercedes opted to ensure Vettel was shown no quarter by employing team orders.Always strong in the second half of the season, this run has been far from solely down to Hamilton. The team have had to develop and work harder and better than ever. They go into the Japanese Grand Prix, which Hamilton has won four times, including three in the past four years, with a car that appears to have nosed ahead of the Ferrari for the first time since the British Grand Prix.“You have hopes you will improve and most years you get better and better through the year,” Hamilton said. “I didn’t know I was going to improve the way I have. The communication with my team has got better, the strategy gets better.”Vettel must be aware the game is all but up. Once again in Japan, a race he too has won four times, he must take the flag to keep his faint hopes alive and even then the mathematics point to Mexico City once more bringing the curtain down.He is having to take what he can from this glorious Suzuka circuit, the spectre of the big picture perhaps just too much to bear. “I don’t like the now or never approach,” he said. “I don’t think there’s much sense in that. No, I think you attack every weekend, every weekend is different, the track is different, the circumstances are different.“I love this track, it’s my favourite track, so I’d better enjoy it and not spoil it by starting to count the things that are against me and focus on the things that are working for me.”The difficulty is that of late so little has been going his way and if there was any pleasure to be had in practice it was Hamilton and Mercedes who were savouring it. He was the quickest driver in the morning and afternoon, with Vettel almost a second down in both sessions. There was a distinct impression that, as in 2017, Japan heralds the beginning of the endgame for Hamilton.“We just want to get it done,” he said. “You want to get the championship whenever you can. As long as you cross the finish line in the lead that’s really all that matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a14368a7f556935a32fc8e0b36451ff0f0296cb/0_216_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858d20bdfa4ece0438948d26ef8bb104","title":"ufc 229 preview conor mcgregor khabib","story":"The UFC’s star problem will be forgotten, for one night at least, as Conor McGregor makes his long-awaited octagon returnDana White wasn’t certain this day would ever come.At times he was pretty confident it\u0026nbspwouldn’t. After all, Conor McGregor just struck it rich. Sure, he was\u0026nbspalready\u0026nbspwhat any common person would deem wealthy from his prior fighting exploits.As UFC’s biggest star, McGregor was routinely earning millions. The last time he entered the octagon – a second-round knockout of Eddie Alvarez in November 2016 – the Irishman raked in a guaranteed $3m that soared past five when pay-per-view upside was calculated.But when he crossed over into boxing for a megafight with Floyd Mayweather last summer, he banked an eight-figure payday.So the mere sight of the sport’s biggest attraction once again sitting on the dais two days before a major fight brought a smile to the UFC president’s face Thursday.“When a guy makes $100m, you don’t know if he’s ever gonna fight again. Conor made a lot of money and I’m sure he had a lot of fun and did what he wanted to do,” White said. “No matter how much you make, you can only sit home for so long and you start to go crazy.”McGregor didn’t just sit at home, though. And he\u0026nbspdid\u0026nbspgo crazy. He made an unexpected appearance at UFC 223 media day in April and proceeded to project a handtruck at a bus transporting many of his fellow fighters, including Khabib Nurmagomedov.The dolly was actually aimed at Nurmagomedov, whom McGregor will meet Saturday at UFC 229 at T-Mobile Arena. Nurmagomedov was involved in a dustup with McGregor’s buddy, Artem Lobov, earlier that week, sending the Notorious One into a rage.The fracas resulted in several injuries, many fight cancellations and a bevy of lawsuits. He was arrested and charged with three counts of assault. At the time, White casted doubt on McGregor’s status in UFC moving forward.“Do you want to be in business with Conor McGregor right now?” White asked in April immediately following the incident. “Do you want to chase this guy around for interviews and buy his fights? Do you?“I don’t think anybody is going to want to right now. I think everybody is going to be pretty disgusted with Conor McGregor right now. Listen, you don’t like Khabib and you don’t like what happened or whatever? Then fight Khabib.”McGregor is doing just that, and the act White once called “criminal, disgusting, despicable,” is now being used as a promotional vehicle – in video highlights and other materials – to hype the highly anticipated showdown. That’s show business.Since the advent of sanctioned prized fighting in the 1800s, promoters have used any available tool – both real and imagined – to sell tickets. White can’t be blamed for changing his tune just a few months later.So yes, White indeed\u0026nbspdoes\u0026nbspwant to be in business with Conor McGregor. He’s not just the most recognizable name in UFC, but in combat sports as a whole.“You can tell this guy is passionate about fighting,” White said. “He loves it. He loves breaking records and he loves making money.”And money he shall make. White projects the event could surpass 3m pay-per-view buys, which would shatter the previous record set by who else? McGregor, whose rematch victory over Nate Diaz in 2016 generated 1.65m buys.With all the legitimate bad blood swirling between both camps, and a tantalizing matchup, maybe White’s prediction will prove right. McGregor is actually the underdog this time. Oddsmakers at Bovada peg Khabib as a slight favorite at minus-160 to McGregor’s plus-130.The 30-year-old Russian is undefeated and hungry. He also matches up well with McGregor as a highly skilled wrestler who finds way to score takedowns time and again.McGregor, 30, is at his best when he’s on his feet and able to deliver his pulverizing strikes. Following an eight-week training camp to prepare for Mayweather and nine-plus rounds that followed in the ring, Mystic Mac’s boxing ability figures to be much-improved.But he must contend with a two-year layoff from the sport he’s actually participating in, and a hungry, determined opponent who is looking to etch his name in lore.\u0026nbsp“I think beginning of first round I have to be careful with him because he has good boxing but my wrestling is my pressure,” Nurmagomedov said Thursday. “He has to kill me to stop me. I’m going to finish this guy and stop this guy and this is my plan.”That was the nature of McGregor’s threats. At various times Thursday he vowed to “knock that man’s nose into the nose bleeds,” and “put a hole in this man’s head”.“I do not give a fuck. I’m ruthless here. I’m here to put a hole in this man’s skull,” McGregor promised. “I’m starving for this man’s head.”Khabib possesses the superior grappling ability, and McGregor has tapped out once before (first meeting with Diaz in 2016 when he submitted to a rear-naked chokehold.) Bravado and violent taunts aside, McGregor has a plan.“I’ve been grappling and wrestling much heavier man this whole camp. 200-pounders, 25 minutes straight,” McGregor said. “I am ready for all outcomes. I feel once I hit him he’s going to turn weak. I expect panic in him early.“I also don’t give a bollocks. I’ve experienced it all. I’ve gotten fucking tired in there. I’ve been on my back in there. I’ve been in every scenario you can be in under the brightest lights in the entire world. I am a veteran. I am here to enjoy this because this is what I love.”Enjoy McGregor now, because win or lose, who knows if or when he’ll be back. He was noncommittal to fighting again after Saturday. And this is\u0026nbspbefore\u0026nbsphe’ll earn another pile of money that promises to rank as the best payday of his UFC career.With Ronda Rousey gone, the UFC is short on stars, but for now, White has his brightest. Now he needs Conor to not just win, but stick around for a while.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c30076d56e117c6e2e0e273b873c6f756fb6ad5/169_125_2660_1596/master/2660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2912125569477e015da3b449dc56f5a","title":"wigan castleford match report","story":"In the depths of Wigan’s despair 12 months ago it felt almost impossible to believe the words that were coming out of Shaun Wane’s mouth. 2017 was the nadir of the Warriors’ recent history, ending with a sixth-placed finish which left some wondering not only whether Wane could rebuild the fortunes of one of rugby league’s most famous clubs but whether he could actually survive the winter.But at his beloved club’s lowest ebb Wane – who crafted his playing career as a no-nonsense, tough-talking forward with Wigan – promised there would not be a repeat. “I’ll go away and look at how we can improve and how I can improve” was Wane’s promise in a chilly Wakefield press room that felt a million miles away from the glitz and glamour of the Grand Final.It seems he was a man of his word all along. On an emotionally charged night in rugby league’s most illustrious town, how fitting it was that Wigan delivered a performance laced with the characteristics that Wane prides his sides on to reach Super League’s holy grail once again. This was not a night for razzle-dazzle it was about passion, emotion and the willingness to keep fighting – something this side possesses in bucketloads.And after negotiating both the emotion and a Castleford side who will look back on this as yet another missed opportunity in a major knockout game, it means Wane and his departing senior players get the opportunity to sign off from Wigan in the perfect manner at Old Trafford in a week’s time.“We’ll save the celebrations for next week,” a visibly emotional Wane said. “I’m very proud of our efforts. I’m so pleased it’s untrue. It was backs against the wall and, when the negative things were being said, they dusted themselves down. Finishing at Old Trafford is a dream.”To deny any side in a play-off semi-final a single point is an achievement but to do it against this Castleford side, who have become renowned for attacking flair, underlines the mentality within the Wigan camp. They were the epitome of a big-game side delivering a big-game performance here – but for the Tigers it was the exact opposite.For Castleford this had shades of last year’s Grand Final, when errors cost them dearly under the bright lights of Old Trafford against Leeds. They have established themselves as a leading side in Super League in recent years but on numerous occasions here – including when the game was in the balance with Wigan leading only 7-0 – they spurned chance after chance.“I thought we panicked in the second half,” their coach, Daryl Powell, said. “We’ve worked so hard through the season and it’s been a tough year but we needed the best game of the season tonight and we didn’t get that from too many of the boys. We tried hard, but maybe a little bit too hard at times.”As well as Wane, this was the final home appearance as a Wigan player for Sam Tomkins, who heads to Catalans in 2019 – and fittingly he had a decisive say in proceedings. The full-back was crucial in attack but equally so in defence as the hosts denied Castleford time and time again throughout a first half in which they led after eight minutes courtesy of Tommy Leuluai’s try.Leuluai, like Tomkins, epitomises the character of this Wigan side and on his 250th appearance for the club he was at the heart of a cherry and white wall which would not be beaten all night long. Though it was not certain at the time, when Tomkins added a drop goal right on the half-time hooter to make it 7-0, the two-score lead was to prove crucial.There were chances again for Castleford after half-time but the tension in their play was all too evident on a night when the prowess of their talented teenage half-back Jake Trueman, who was ruled out with a hand injury, was sorely missed. And crucially, any time Castleford did get close to breaching Wigan, they were met by resilient last-ditch defending.When Tomkins scythed through on the hour mark before adding another penalty to make it 13-0, it was clear it would be the Warriors, not the Tigers, heading to Old Trafford. Tomkins even had time for a second drop goal in the final seconds though the cake needed no icing. There will be one hell of a party if all goes to plan for Wane and Wigan next weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49554c64babe719323ff793b7d2da0899d84aaf/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65716661f61f4234da0fd7092d5b74af","title":"brett kavanaugh confirmation america","story":"The only thing everyone agrees on is that the ision runs deep – and no one is quite sure where it is headingIn the phrase of the journalist Carl Bernstein, this is what a cold civil war looks like.A group of ageing white male senators stand on a podium to defend a white male judge chosen by a white male president to sit on the supreme court. They are opposed by another group of senators that include an African American man and an African American woman. Thousands of women stage a sit-in on Capitol Hill and chant their belief in the woman who accuses the nominee of sexual assault. All this in a country where the first black president was succeeded by a man accused of sexual harassment and trafficking in white nationalism.If this were a movie, the casting director would be fired for being too obvious.Perhaps even more than the debate over NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, the bitter struggle over Brett Kavanaugh’s ascent to the supreme court – which now looks assured – has brutally exposed fault lines across age, gender, geography, media, party and race. The only thing everyone agrees on is that the ision runs deep. No one is quite sure where it is heading.In the eyes of critics, Kavanaugh has come to embody white male privilege. He was nominated by Donald Trump, a 72-year-old who has stoked racial ision and is seen as a vehicle for white nationalism. His enforcer is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a 76-year-old white man born in Alabama under Jim Crow who now represents Kentucky.When Christine Blasey Ford appeared before the Senate judiciary committee to testify against Kavanaugh, Republicans could not hide the dire spectacle of 11 white men sitting in judgment. The chairman was Chuck Grassley, 85, from Iowa. Orrin Hatch, 84 and from Utah, described Ford as an “attractive” and “pleasing” witness. The senior Democrat, by contrast, was Dianne Feinstein, 85 and from California, in a contingent that also included the younger Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Kamala Harris (California).The Arizona Republican Jeff Flake was confronted in an elevator by two New Yorkers, both survivors of sexual assault: Maria Gallagher and Ana Maria Archila, the latter born in Colombia and active in mobilising immigrant voters. Trump gave a mocking impression of Ford’s testimony at a rally in Mississippi. As usual, the crowd was mostly white.“It’s the culture war on steroids, an incredible ide and intense to the point where people won’t talk to each other in some cases,” Bill Bennett, education secretary under Ronald Reagan, told the Washington Post. “You have the anti-Trump resistance, the #MeToo movement and the supreme court making for a perfect storm of controversy.”At almost every turn, the battle lines are drawn. Black against white, college-educated against not, “expert” against “deplorable”, hipster against hunter, Hollywood against heartland, liberal against conservative, pro-choice against pro-life, secular against Christian, urban against rural, woman against man, young against old, citizens of nowhere against citizens of somewhere. As the New York Times noted in 2016 under the headline Duck Dynasty vs Modern Family, the split even extends to TV. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has characterised it as “Bubble-ville” against “Bubba-ville”.The groups are, of course, not monolithic. There are men who oppose Kavanaugh and women who back him. There are Hollywood conservatives and deep south liberals. There are black Republicans, female Republicans and young Republicans. But the fact such groups are becoming more remarked upon and more newsworthy shows how the exception proves the rule.Candace Owens, a young African American woman, fetishes her status as a Trump supporter when launching broadsides at the other team. Jason Isbell, a country music star raised in deep red Alabama, disappointed some fans by declaring himself a Democrat. What might once have been an inidual choice is increasingly become an act of contrarianism.In his new book The Red and the Blue, Steve Kornacki traces a “new kind of tribalism” to the rancourous showdowns between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It culminated in the 2000 election, he writes, where for the first time the electoral maps fixed Democrats as blue and Republicans as red. America had become “a nation of two political tribes, each with its own value system, its own grudges and resentments, its own worldview”.Along with Pat Buchanan, Gingrich was instrumental in putting abortion rights at the centre of the “culture wars”. Even before Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh, the possibility the judge might help overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision guaranteed a partisan split in the Senate. Divides also open up over censorship, drug use, gun rights, homosexuality and immigration.Cable news and the web have only amplified them. It has become a commonplace to observe how Fox News and MSNBC present competing versions of reality without a shared set of facts. The more loud and outraged the voices, the higher the ratings: politics as celebrity wrestling. Social networks such as Facebook, far from being egalitarian utopias, have merely exacerbated the clustering and confirmation bias.But in 2016, Trump rode a wave of racially charged populism to win in the electoral college while losing the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots. The parties’ demographic make-up is becoming more and more polarised. In November’s midterm elections, record numbers of women and people of colour are running for the Democrats. It will be more of the same for the mostly male, mostly white Republican party.Each side increasingly takes on the fervour of a sports fan, dealing in the absolutes of victory and defeat. That was evident in the saga of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Flake, apparently moved by that encounter in the elevator, called for the FBI to reopen its investigation, explaining: “The country needs to feel better about this. This is ripping us apart, and there are enough things ripping us apart.”But now he is poised to vote Kavanaugh on to the highest court in the land. It seems unlikely that the country feels any better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33ae2d3b66b6a30d28666f72d85ed17caba15c6a/0_70_2806_1684/master/2806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfab959af6a3884f14c85705c4982771","title":"denis mukwege nadia murad nobel peace prize 2018","story":"Gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad are jointly awardedTwo leaders of the struggle against sexual violence in war have won this year’s Nobel peace prize, a choice that will hearten campaigners fighting for greater recognition of a grave but long-neglected problem, and may also bring hope to victims worldwide that their suffering has at last been recognised.The Norwegian Nobel committee said that Denis Mukwege, a doctor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nadia Murad, a 25-year-old Yazidi activist, had been awarded the prize “for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict”.Mukwege, 63, has spent decades caring for victims of sexual assault in his homeland. Murad has used her own story of enslavement and rape by Islamic State to publicise human rights abuses.The Nobel committee said on Friday that both had “put their own personal security at risk by courageously combating war crimes and securing justice for victims.” Mukwege was in surgery when he heard he had won the peace prize. He learned he had won because he heard colleagues and patients crying. “I can see in the faces of many women how they are happy to be recognised,” he said.Murad said: “I share this award with all Yazidis, with all the Iraqis, Kurds and all the minorities and all survivors of sexual violence around the world.As a survivor, I am grateful for this opportunity to draw international attention to the plight of the Yazidi people who have suffered unimaginable crimes since the genocide by Daesh (Isis).”The choice has been universally applauded. Some recent awards have been controversial: the former US president Barack Obama won in 2009 after less than a year in office, and the European Union won in 2012. Last year’s winner was the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.This year’s peace prize announcement comes amid a heightened attention to the sexual abuse of women in war, in the workplace and in society that has been highlighted by the “#MeToo” movement.The committee said: “Both laureates have made a crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, war crimes. Denis Mukwege is the helper who has devoted his life to defending these victims. Nadia Murad is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others.“Each of them in their own way has helped to give greater visibility to war-time sexual violence, so that the perpetrators can be held accountable for their actions.”Mukwege, a gynaecologist, founded and maintains the Panzi hospital in Bukavu, in the east of the DRC, where he has cared for tens of thousands of women who suffered sexual assault in the country’s recurrent civil conflict. Mukwege survived a kidnapping attempt in 2012 but has continued his work.The committee described him as “the foremost, most unifying symbol both nationally and internationally of the struggle to end sexual violence in war and armed conflict”.Murad was abducted with other Yazidi women in August 2014 when their home village of Kocho in Sinjar, northern Iraq, was attacked by Isis. Captured alongside her sisters, she lost six brothers and her mother as the extremists killed the village’s men and any women considered too old to be sexually exploited.She eventually escaped and had shown uncommon courage in repeatedly recounting her own sufferings and speaking up on behalf of other victims, the committee said.Murad is the second youngest Nobel peace prize laureate after Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she won in 2014.The announcement was welcomed by prominent campaigners and organisations.“Well deserved and long awaited Nobel recognition of the fight against sexual violence in war, said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch.Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said he had first proposed Mukwege for the award 10 years ago. “The best Nobel Prize in a long time. Finally focus on horrific \u0026amp widespread sexual violence in war. Must lead to action against impunity for perpetrators \u0026amp preventive action within armies \u0026amp militias,” Egeland tweeted.A spokesperson for German chancellor Angela Merkel, herself tipped as a potential laureate, said she has great respect for the work of both winners.Murad came to Germany in 2015 as part of a special program for female victims of violence and met Merkel in 2016 to discuss her work helping others.The Dr Denis Mukwege Foundation, a Netherlands-based international human rights organisation working to end sexual violence in wars, for whom the gynaecologist is an advisor, said the the Nobel prize committee had sent a clear message that sexual violence in wars is unacceptable and must stop.“We will continue to work with Dr Mukwege and his team, as well as Nadia Murad, towards a world in which sexual violence as a method of warfare is abolished and survivors receive the care they need,” it said in a statement.The government of Iraq recognised Murad’s courageous campaigning on behalf of victims of sexual violence during conflict.Authorities in the DRC have congratulated Mukwege, while acknowledging that relations have been strained over the years. Mukwege in the past has criticised the government and accused its troops of a culture of sexual violence.Lambert Mende, the minister of information, said that Mukwege has done “remarkable work” treating victims of sexual violence during years of conflict in the country’s east.Mende said “we have not always been in agreement”, adding that Mukwege has had a tendency to “politicise” his humanitarian work. However, he said: “We salute that a compatriot is recognised.”Mukwege, the son of a pastor, trained as an obstetrician in France. The first patient treated in the maternity clinic he founded was a rape survivor. Over two decades later, his Panzi Hospital has treated more than 50,000 women and girls.As well as physical treatment, Mukwege created an approach that focused on providing psychological and socioeconomic support to the survivors, as well as founding a legal programme to help them obtain justice.Beginning in 2013, he and his team had to care for dozens of young girls from the town of Kavumu who were taken from their beds and raped by a militia led by a provincial member of parliament who believed raping children would protect them from their enemies.This year, 216 iniduals and 115 organisations were nominated for the prize. They included the Syrian civilian aid group the White Helmets, Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper, the US whistleblower Edward Snowden and the UN high commissioner for refugees. The 2018 prize is worth just over a million dollars.One recent controversy has involved Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the award for her fierce resistance to the repressive junta in Myanmar. She has recently been criticised for failing to act to stop violence directed at the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority.The potential winners touted by bookies this year included some isive names: Kim Jong-un and Monn Jae-in were among the favourites (jointly) for their steps towards rapprochement between North and South Korea, followed by Donald Trump, for the same reason."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d1412469d6d9a1814b380eae9e97603a312645/932_120_2066_1239/master/2066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d84f4f97786c930e3008ea70f722f0a2","title":"juncker criticises british media and urges limits to press freedom","story":"European commission president admits he ‘will not miss’ disrespectful criticsJean-Claude Juncker has insisted that there must be limits to the freedom of the press as he accused British media of trampling over the human rights of politicians.In an outspoken interview at a crunch point in the Brexit negotiations, the European commission president also lamented that the former prime minister, David Cameron, had blocked him from campaigning during the 2016 referendum.“If the commission intervened, perhaps the right questions would have entered the debate,” Juncker told a group of Austrian newspapers. “Now you discover new problems almost daily, on both sides. At that time, it was already clear to us what trials and tribulations this pitiful vote of the British would lead to. I am always amazed about what I am always blamed for.”Juncker, 63, has been the focus for attacks in the media over his reputed fondness for alcohol, and his father’s record during the second world war.Joseph Juncker, who died in 2016, was forced to fight in the German Wehrmacht after the Nazi regime invaded Luxembourg. He has been inaccurately accused by British newspapers of being a sympathiser of Adolf Hitler’s regime.The commission president was accused in recent months of being drunk at a Nato summit in Brussels following the emergence of a video that showed him unable to walk without assistance.His spokesman insisted that a bad case of sciatica and cramps had been to blame. Juncker himself appealed for “respect” after questions were raised about his health.The former prime minister of Luxembourg, whose appointment as commission president was vehemently opposed by Cameron and a significant number of UK newspapers, said in his latest interview that while he was determined to strike a deal with Theresa May he was not sorry that the UK media would be less of a significant force in Brussels.“The British press is such that I will not miss it,” Juncker said. “It is, in part so, that they do not respect the human rights of political actors at all. Press freedom also has its limits … One should not bring people in privacy in distress.”Juncker, whose term as commission president will end next year, went on: “Incidentally, the Cameron government had asked me not to interfere in this 2016 referendum campaign.“In the meantime, I regret that the commission did not want to do it, because that was the British wish.”In the wake of Juncker’s nomination as commission president in 2014, Cameron had admitted he would face an uphill struggle to keep Britain in the EU, claiming that the new EU chief had been a force for weakening the standing of the member states. Only the hard-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, backed the UK’s opposition to the president.Juncker nevertheless struck a more optimistic note in his interview about the Brexit negotiations, with a crucial leaders’ summit less than two months away.The EU has said that it needs to see “maximum progress” by the European council meeting on 17 October, in particular on the Irish border issue. The summit in Brussels has been described by EU leaders as the “moment of truth” in the Brexit talks.Juncker told reporters in Austria – the current holder of the rolling presidency of the European council – that recent days had provided some cause for optimism in the talks. A summit in mid-November has been pencilled in should an agreement not be possible in October.“I assume that we find an agreement as to the terms of the withdrawal. We also need to agree on a political statement that accompanies this withdrawal agreement. We are not that far yet.“But our will is unbroken to reach agreement with the British government. It must be remembered time and again that Britain is leaving the union, not the European Union from the UK.He added: “I have reason to think that the rapprochement potential between both sides has increased in recent days. But it can not be foreseen whether we will finish in October. If not, we’ll do it in November.”Juncker declined to comment on whether he believed that Brexit might yet be avoided, given the isions in the British government and parliament on the issue.He said: “That is not a question that concerns the commission or the union as such. That is in the discretion of the British parliament and the government. I do not interfere in inner-cabinet debates in the UK. There is enough confusion.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3653281.1538764777!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools may send children home due to teacher shortages","story":"Boys and girls on their first day in school. Video: Bryan O\u0027BrienThe Irish Tims\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Richard Bruton at the launch of a new programme, “OurKidsCode”, to help parents teach children creative computing in Dublin yesterday.  Primary schools in the capital say they are running the risk of having to send pupils home from school early due to acute difficulties finding substitute teaching cover.One Dublin primary school this week issued a letter to parents to express its regret that children had to go home early and start late. “We are having great difficulty in recruiting teachers and we often do not have cover if a teacher is absent because of illness, extra-curricular work or in-service training,” the letter stated.The principal wrote that the problem was not unique to the school but common across other schools in the Dublin area.“We recently had a young teacher turn down a full-time job as he could not afford accommodation in Dublin. He will be able to get work closer to his home and out of Dublin. Unfortunately, this situation may continue.”The school has advised parents that they will be texted in advance with changes to timetables caused by staff shortages.Carmel Hume, a principal in south Dublin and member of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s (INTO) central executive committee, said it was likely the phenomenon of children being sent home early will become more common as time goes on.“Schools are in a very difficult position. It’s almost impossible to find substitute cover for sickness or maternity cover,” she said. “Schools are faced with having to split children between different classes or using the special education teams to take classes. No one wants to do it, but some schools may have no option but to send children home for health and safety reasons.”Ms Hume said many young teachers are moving out of the capital because they cannot afford rent, while others are moving abroad to secure better pay and conditions.The Department of Education, however, has said that difficulties with substitution cover are likely to be linked to the fact that more new teachers are being hired than at any other time in the history of the State. It says thousands of additional posts have been created to cater for the growth in student numbers.It has also pointed out that pay is being restored to new entrants which would see teachers benefit by thousands of euro. The department has said this deal would see new entrant salaries jump by between €1,000 and €3,600 next year, depending on when they were hired.Minister for Education Richard Bruton said recently that new teachers’ starting salaries will rise to €36,318 from this month, and are set to rise to €37,692 in October 2020. “Even in a tight labour market, these are very attractive starting salaries for graduates,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3653413.1538773346!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord br%C3%ADd smith neatly finishes varadkar s sentence","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople Before Profit TD Bríd Smith: knew what Leo was going to say even before he stopped himself saying it. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsWe had forgotten about Leo being lost for words until Bríd Smith reminded us during Leaders’ Questions on Wednesday.The People Before Profit TD brought the Taoiseach back to a Dáil exchange on housing he’d had the previous week with Solidarity TD Mick Barry.“You seemed unable to finish a statement in response to my colleague,” she remarked. “You said that you believed this side of the House ides people. We create walls between those, you said, ‘who pay for everything and who don’t qualify for anything, and those who . . .’“But you couldn’t finish the statement. You got a bit flustered and you sat down. And that was good spin and good drama training that made you sit down because I’m going to tell you, what you were going to say is ‘those who pay for nothing and expect everything for free’ and you were referring to people who live in social housing. I grew up in a social housing estate, as I am sure many other deputies did and we paid our rent . . . And it was not a ghetto.”Leo Varadkar wasn’t buying her theory.People in the chamber hadn’t a bull’s notion what the pair of them were on about.Harking back to his exchange with Cork North Central TD Barry, the Taoiseach said he had been describing the sort of politics (“which is to ide people”) practiced by Bríd and her fellow socialists.Barry had given him examples of sites in Dublin and Cork where public housing on public land was proposed but had yet to get the go-ahead. Such projects present “a good and viable alternative to the Government’s plan for mass privatisation of land through the Land Development Agency”.The Taoiseach responded by saying the local authorities had plans for the areas mentioned involving a mix of housing – private, affordable and social.Socialists, he said, want to ide people into those who live in private estates and those who live in council estates.Then came the bit which caught Bríd Smith’s attention: “They want to ide our society into people who live in different areas – some people who pay for everything and qualify for nothing and other people, eh, who-who-who-who, em, who- who, eh, peop . . .who . . .”Clearly flustered, the stuttering Taoiseach flailed his hands about.“Well, it’s the wrong way to do it!” he concluded, sitting down.Fallacy or no, as fal-las-we-cy it, Smith called it dead right. Varadkar, in full flow, was cute enough to see he was about to put his foot in it and reversed engines immediately.Housing dominated the week.It’s been a long week. It felt like years. Maybe because it has been years.Back in 2011, as the country was still reeling from the economic crash, taoiseach Enda Kenny pledged to take action and eliminate homeless by 2016. In 2016, Kenny admitted things didn’t really work out as planned.“It hasn’t gone as well as we’d have liked,” he said.But no matter. Because in July of 2016, Simon Coveney came galloping over the horizon on a horse called JCB waving a blueprint above his head like a Stetson and zig-zagging through “five pillars” on the way to “Rebuilding Ireland”.Rebuilding Ireland was an “action-driven plan that will result in a dramatic increase in the delivery of homes nationwide”. The country and the government now had “a clear roadmap” on how to proceed with housing.“It is action-orientated,” confirmed the taoiseach.Coveney was very gung-ho with his “80 separated actions structured under five main pillars of concerted actions right across government.”He had another big launch for the rental pillar and the plan led to a major row with Fianna Fáil, upon whose support the government relies.Meanwhile, Fr Peter McVerry was one of the “stakeholders” working in the area of homelessness invited to the launch of Rebuilding Ireland. He was impressed by what he heard, and said so, but wasn’t going to get carried away until he saw a reduction in the figures.Fr McVerry was the final speaker at the housing protest in Dublin on Wednesday and he was cheered to the rafters by 10,000 or so citizens who turned out for the midday march. He was right not to get carried away by the 2011 plan.Of course, the first plan that year was only the action plan on achieving a working action plan. “Now that we have this plan,” said Enda of the second one at the second big launch, “the emphasis is now on implementation. You can be sure we mean business in this regard.”And still they came, along with a new minister: the pillars and the plans but precious few places for people to call home. Houses on land, not off-balance sheet. Rapid Build Housing Programme, anyone?“Can yis not just build some houses?” an exasperated populace implores their Government. “You own loads of land in all the right places. Just build the bleedin’ houses. Like they did before.”Leo Varadkar insists his Fine Gael government does not have an ideological aversion to building houses on public land with public money for hard-pressed people.If hot air could build houses there would be no housing shortage today.This week, the Taoiseach agreed there is no housing crisis.He agreed there is a housing emergency. But it’s only a word, he told the Dáil on Wednesday. It won’t put mortar on any bricks.On Thursday, his Government opposed a motion calling for the housing and homelessness crisis to be declared a national emergency.It’s been a while coming, but on Tuesday the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party finally witnessed a showdown between maverick party TD John McGuinness and his exasperated leader, Micheál Martin.McGuinness has long been a thorn in the side of the leadership and is something of a law unto himself, even among the undisciplined ranks of the party’s current crop. A minor example of this would be his recent appearance in Leinster House with Gemma O’Doherty, the former Irish Independent journalist who was trying to get a place on the ticket for the presidential election.While local representatives may not be under strict orders to support a particular candidate, the parliamentary party voted to endorse Michael D Higgins, a policy decision which Martin expects his TDs and senators to uphold.McGuinness was observed showing O’Doherty around Leinster House and introducing her to politicians in the period before nominations closed. She had been attempting to persuade 20 Oireachtas members to nominate her, but was unsuccessful. McGuinness’s actions didn’t go down well with some of his colleagues.In August, the TD for Carlow-Kilkenny, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote to Fianna Fáil public representatives all over the country accusing the leadership of having no “backbone” and seeking their support for an early recall of the Dáil to discuss his Affordable Housing and Fair Mortgage Bill.He introduced the Bill to the Dáil in July to applause in the chamber. However, since then, McGuinness says the party has not given him any support.He complained in his letter about bringing Edmund Honohan, the Master of the High Court, to meet senior Fianna Fáil members, “but he got little thought or time.” Honohan drafted the Bill, which aims to tackle the mortgage crisis.Having defended and promoted the Bill at parliamentary party meetings, McGuinness said he got no support from the leadership “both elected and unelected” and the party needed to “find its soul and regrow its backbone, become the opposition it used to be”.At Tuesday’s parliamentary party meeting, McGuinness brought up the subject of his Bill again. “Are you going to support this?” he demanded, whereupon Martin suddenly got stuck in. “Hold on a second,” he said, reminding him of that letter about the party having no backbone. He declared he wouldn’t be taking any lectures from him.Martin then rounded on the TD for saying he walked out when the Bill was being introduced and then for claiming he didn’t give Honohan a proper hearing. “I did no such thing. That’s not the case and you know it.”He said he met the people involved in drafting the Bill and they agreed with him that it needed a lot more work if it was to succeed.If McGuinness didn’t want to take his word on it, perhaps Jim O’Callaghan, the party’s justice spokesman, might take him through it. O’Callaghan, who is a Senior Counsel, then went through the Bill. He took it apart. While fully in favour of what it proposed to do, the lawyer pointed up problem after problem.The rest of the parliamentary party said nothing. Even Marc MacSharry, who earlier supported McGuinness, went quiet.The TD still insisted that his Bill should go before the house as it could be tweaked along the way. But he was told there was too much tweaking required.If they were just to “throw it in” and hope the Government would help it along, “I think they’d just laugh at us,” concluded O’Callaghan.Nothing like clearing the air.Don’t expect a rapprochement between John and Micheál anytime soon.Culinary news from Kildare Street, where politicians like to keep on top of the latest trends in the food world.Wednesday saw a groundbreaking development on the evening menu in the Dáil canteen when the phenomenon known as “The Spice Bag” made its debut in Leinster House. Strips of deep-fried seasoned chicken mixed with shreds of carrot and onion all jumbled up with spicy, salty chips were presented for the delectation of diners. The delicacy was not on the menu in the Members’ restaurant, where delusions of grandeur are the order of the day.However, we hear some TDs sneaked in portions from the adjacent canteen and Joan Burton was heard explaining the finer points of this Chinese takeaway favourite to a number of her nonplussed Dáil colleagues.The offering was a runaway success. Politicians and staff couldn’t get enough of it.

This academy is more widely known as the GRU Conservatory.In a further apparent security lapse, Bellingcat also discovered a Russian vehicle ownership database that listed Aleksey Morenets as the registered user - and perhaps also the owner - of a Lada car. As well as his name, his passport number, verified in the October 4 disclosure, was included on the vehicle document.This car is registered at Komsomolsky Prospekt 20, the address thought to be the headquarters of Unit 26165. Other vehicles registered to the same address revealed the names of a further 305 iniduals. These people were all aged between 27 to 53, Bellingcat revealed, all well within the ages of military service.All 305 names had passport numbers and, in most cases, mobile telephone numbers attached. All information can be found on the publicly-available automobile registration database.The  understands that registering a private car using the GRU’s address would mean the inidual would not need to pay car tax and would be ignored for any traffic offences.Bob Seely, the Tory MP who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said: It is extraordinarily unprofessional on the part of the GRU. It shows that subversion is probably beyond their professional capability - they can\u0027t even cover their tracks in the most basic of ways. It is very sloppy and makes President Putin look foolish.We need to be finding out where all these people have been travelling. 305 is the best part of a battalion  - let\u0027s find how many of them have been to the UK and whereabouts.This image released by the Dutch Defense Ministry on Thursday Oct. 4, 2018 shows the diplomatic passport of Aleksei Morenets, one of four Russian officers of the GRU.Mr Seely has said he will unveil the real identity of the second Skripal suspect - hitherto known under the pseudonym Alexander Petrov - in a joint event with Bellingcat in Britain’s House of Commons on October 9.Speaking exclusively to the , Carnegie Moscow Centre analyst and former Russian diplomat Alexander Baunov argued that since the 1990s and 2000s, when Russia was impoverished and friendly with the US and Europe, the once-formidable GRU has lagged behind Western spy agencies.It now finds itself unprepared for the Cold War level of tension and scrutiny that followed the annexation of Crimea, he suggests, and vulnerable to innovations like online open-source investigations.Mark Galeotti, a scholar of Russian security services, has argued that the GRU\u0027s sometimes crude methods stem from its previous focus on special forces operations which has only recently been shifted toward the covert actions typical of a traditional intelligence agency. Writing last week he said GRU was a particularly aggressive service with a “wartime mindset,” now at the forefront of “Moscow\u0027s murderous active measures campaign abroad”.Please review our commenting policyBeware the wounded bear: Russia could hit back hard after inept spies exposedComment: Are you being targeted by Russian spies?

He shredded them.Only in this case it wasn’t a stack of worthless documents, it was an envelope filled with more than $1000 (£760) in bank notes that his parents had been saving up to pay for American football tickets.We realised it was gone the next day and started to search. We searched everywhere in our house and could not find it, Jackee Belnap told CBS News.I have a bin where I put junk mail and any files I want shredded and my son and I shred it when it gets full. I looked through that and then it made me think to look in the shredder.The money was all there. If not exactly in mint condition.We were silent for about five minutes and just sorted money out and then I broke the silence and said, \u0027this will make a great wedding story someday,\u0027 said Jackee.In all, the envelope contained $1060 that was supposed to go to her husband’s parents who had paid for University of Utah football season tickets. The envelope had been left on the counter to remind them to hand it over at the weekend.She and her husband knew exactly who the culprit was.Leo had no idea he did anything wrong, she continued. It felt unfair to get mad and he probably doesn\u0027t even know what cash is as we use our credit card for almost everything.There may yet be a happy ending. The family has been told they can send the shredded notes to the Department of the Treasury which reimburses tens of thousands of people every year for their mutilated currency – as much as $30 million in all.Beware the wounded bear: Russia could hit back hard after inept spies exposedComment: Are you being targeted by Russian spies?

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of UK spy agency GCHQ, said that it agreed with those denials from the two companies.Apple and Amazon deny report they were hit by huge Chinese hack“We aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple, an\u0026nbspNCSC\u0026nbspspokesperson said.“The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us.”The denial came after Apple and Amazon – the two companies named in the report – both emphatically rejected the content of the report. They both said they were unaware of the claims and had undertaken detailed investigations to find any chips and had discovered nothing.Apple even published a special page on its website, under the title What Businessweek got wrong about Apple, that took all of the claims on in detail. It said on that page that there is no truth to these claims, that it never found malicious chips, and that its contacts in law enforcement had not heard of such a case either.As we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue, Apple concluded.\u0026nbspApple has never found malicious chips in our servers.Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organisations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is their victory and nothing to do with any politicians, despite what they might have you believe\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentUnilever had planned to consolidate its headquarters at its base in RotterdamPoliticians of varying stripes were quick to jump on marmite maker Unilever’s decision to abandon plans to pull its headquarters out of London, and its shares out of the FTSE 100, and no wonder. It’s created quite the froth.\u0026nbspBut let’s be quite clear: This is not their victory, whatever their stripe.\u0026nbspIt is not down to London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Kahn and it has nothing to do with any efforts made by Theresa May’s Tory Government. As for the ramshackle army of gloating Brexiteers? They can belt up too.\u0026nbspUnilever scraps plans to move HQ from London to RotterdamLegal \u0026amp General vows to vote against Unilever’s planned Dutch moveThis was, in point of fact, a battle fought and won through the prosaic virtue\u0026nbspof responsible engagement and activism by big City institutions acting\u0026nbspin the interests of the people who invest with them, which is not something that they always do.\u0026nbspUnilever moving its headquarters out of the UK and abandoning its dual headed Anglo-Dutch corporate structure would have seen it ejected from both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share indices.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspwould have forced funds run by the likes Legal \u0026amp General, Standard Life, Aviva and others, to sell up (full disclosure, I have\u0026nbspfunds that track FTSE\u0026nbspindices\u0026nbspand Unilever’s presence within them thus benefits me) because of the rules they operate under.\u0026nbspAs a result, there would have been an awful lot of stock hitting the market in a short time, which would have depressed the selling price. But Unilever’s London exit - a Lexit? - would also have deprived their funds of a high quality, well run, company\u0026nbspa reliable performer with a reliable idend that is\u0026nbspthe sort of hardy perennial every investor needs.\u0026nbspIt was thus very much in the interests of the\u0026nbspclients of London institutions\u0026nbspfor them to say no, and for them to do so publicly, as a number of big fund managers did (but not, sadly, BlackRock, a heavy hitting index\u0026nbsptracker manager).This left Unilever, which needed to secure the support of 75 per cent of its UK shareholders, facing a potentially embarrassing defeat.\u0026nbspIn the City you don’t hold a vote you can’t win if you can help it, so it sensibly withdrew.\u0026nbspNot happily, mind. The statement it issued explaining the decision had\u0026nbspthe feeling of a Scooby Doo style “we’d have got away with it if it weren’t for those meddling kids”.I imagine there will be some strained conversations between a board that robustly defended the plan - “guided by the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders by creating a stronger, simpler and more competitive Unilever” - and investors over the coming months.\u0026nbspShareholder value was clearly not the sole issue in bringing this forward, however.\u0026nbspForget Brexit. Going Dutch would have made it much harder for the likes of Kraft Foods to come forward with opportunistic, and bad, bids in future because of the regulations in that country. Remember, Unilever only narrowly avoided getting taken out by Kraft last year.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It was an emotional day to say the least,” Evans tweeted on Thursday night.“Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor. To everyone in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in the audience, thank you for the memories! Eternally grateful.”The as-yet-untitled fourth Avengers movie\u0026nbspwill be Marvel’s 22nd film and Evans’ 10th as Steve Rogers AKA\u0026nbspCaptain America, the superhero supergroup’s tactician and cool head in fiery situations.Evans’ tweet has had a staggering 246,000 retweets\u0026nbspat the time of writing, with his farewell to the role receiving an outpouring of love from fans and colleagues alike.Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds tweeted: “I’m not crying. I’m weeping. There’s a difference,” with Dwayne Johnson adding: “What a run you had brother. Congrats on breathing life into such an iconic character. Keep on keeping’ on.”Though Captain America didn’t appear\u0026nbspin the Marvel Cinematic Universe until five movies in, he is seen as one of the original Avengers, having fought all manner of evil forces alongside Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor and others.Evans’ exit won’t come as a huge surprise as he has previously spoken about wanting “to get off the train before they push you off,” and Avengers: Infinity War left the fate of several characters in the balance.It remains to be seen how his version of Captain America is written out in Avengers 4, one fan hoping it’s not one particularly sombre departure Steve Rogers made in the comics.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit. The Ash Project was conceived and is managed by the unit.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Andy Martin says it’s time to revive the sound of silenceClick to followThe IndependentIllustrations by Izzy OrtonI’m sitting in my local library, in Church Street, London. Trying to concentrate, the way you do. There are people reading and writing, and taking books off shelves, and reading the newspaper. There are also two people, one man and one woman, making telephone calls. I imagine it’s a WhatsApp call or Skype, via the library’s decent wifi setup. The guy is keeping his voice down a bit (some kind of business deal), the woman, if anything, is speaking louder than normal. She is upset. Something about how she has thrown her partner out of the house for excessive drinking or something. Either way, it’s a sad tale.\u0026nbspBut what I really want to know is this: whatever happened to those signs in libraries that said,\u0026nbsp“SILENCE PLEASE”, or “SILENCE MEANS SILENCE”? When did libraries become silence-free zones? The telephone callers come in here specifically to shoot the breeze. The library has become a mecca for mobile phone users who can’t get a decent signal in the street.I was recently on a train journey from London to Bristol. An hour or two. I had reserved a seat in the “Quiet Carriage”. A train is not a library (although that’s not a bad idea). But it seems reasonable to have at least one compartment dedicated to people who want to keep it down for a while. There are polite notices (that not everybody reads) asking passengers to refrain from (as per the library) making telephone calls. But what about loud conversations? Is there a protocol about that? Two women, sitting opposite one another, keep up their dialogue, punctuated by laughter, all the way to Bristol. Maybe they really are old friends who haven’t seen one another for years. But I get the feeling that, overt content aside, everything they say is a protest, a revolt against oppressive peace and quiet.‘Africa’ by Toto to be played at Bristol music venue for entire nightYou will often find me walking down the street (or, indeed, sitting in libraries or in quiet carriages) wearing a pair of headphones – the big ones that go right over your ears. And you are welcome to tap me on the shoulder and say:\u0026nbsp“Aren’t you that curmudgeon who goes about complaining about noise and yet here you are with headphones on, listening to music. Isn’t there some kind of contradiction here, verging on hypocrisy?” (or words to that effect). And I might reply to you – perhaps wordlessly – by removing the headphones and inviting you to listen to… the sound of silence. I am wearing the headphones to keep the music out.\u0026nbspBut in any case, even if I were listening to that old song by Simon and Garfunkel (now to be heard in a rather louder version by a band called Disturbed), there is a big difference between consensual listening and the non-consensual kind. Take, for example, my local gym. Again, the gym is not a library or a quiet carriage. You expect to hear a certain amount of grunting and groaning and huffing and puffing, not to mention the chugging of X-trainers and rowing machines and the clang of weights hitting the floor. But do I have to listen to yet another droopy Ed Sheeran tune as well? In fact most of the “songs” at the gym are not songs at all but rather extended disco programmes consisting of some endlessly repeated electronic pulse. Like static, but too irregular to count as white noise.Even in the post-industrial landscape we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountainI went to the trouble of writing to the higher powers at the gym to register dismay at this aural fodder and trying to get them to change their playlist, but was told that the “music” is bought in as a package from some anonymous provider, so can’t be modified, and is deemed to be suitable for the purpose of exercising anyway. Someone is paying for this garbage? I’d pay not to have to listen to it.Does life need a perpetual soundtrack, as if it were a movie, with a theme tune denoting sharks or flying saucers or romance? Or commentary, as if it were the Big Match or the Big Fight? We are living through an age of maximum noise, which has driven me into the arms of a new book, A History of Silence, by the French historian Alain Corbin, who has also written marvellous histories of bells, beaches\u0026nbspand smells (and even a history of the weather). Books used to be largely audio. Since there\u0026nbspweren’t too many copies around (and there weren’t too many people capable of reading them), they would be read out loud to the assembled throng. It’s only in the era since Gutenberg and Caxton that the text has become the accessory of quiet contemplation, the opportunity for a silent conversation going on in your head, and Shakespeare can write:\u0026nbsp“Come and take choice of all my library and so beguile thy sorrow.” A History of Silence is definitely beguiling, like an oasis of tranquility amid the maelstrom.My father, I recall, was close enough to a bomb exploding to lose 50 per cent of his hearing. But I want to set aside acts of war and concentrate on what, for want of a better term, we can call acts of peace. Probably the least peaceful environment I’ve ever been exposed to is a metalworking factory. My job was to feed and clean out the machines. Which kept on ceaselessly stamping out nuts and bolts. Maybe they provide ear-protectors these days, but then you were on your own. It was the aural equivalent of hell, the dark but also ear-splitting satanic mills, where you can’t hear yourself think. I didn’t last too long in that cacophonic job, mainly because I thought it was going to inflict lasting cerebral damage, like getting in the ring with a heavyweight for punishing round after round. They worry about footballers heading the ball, but what if the ball is pounding into your head all day long?\u0026nbspAnd talking of headbanging, isn’t this the point of the typical rock concert? Was it on the Isle of Wight or that one in Suffolk –\u0026nbspLatitude Festival – where I found myself rammed up against one of the loudspeakers? My brain is still reeling too much from the experience to recall exactly. It seems ironic that even musicians need to wear earplugs. Probably didn’t happen to JS\u0026nbspBach. I know Beethoven went deaf, but probably not as the result of an over-amplified pianoforte. \u0026nbspI still don’t understand how Stephen King (according to his book\u0026nbspOn Writing) can write while listening to loud rock music (Metallica is one of his go-to bands). Or maybe it explains why Jack Nicholson can’t wait to pick up an axe in The Shining. Conversely,\u0026nbspProust needed the cork-lined bedroom to write in and even bribed builders working on the apartment above to stop work so he could finish a sentence.\u0026nbspA silent retreat would test me to breaking point. Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the wordThe rise of the Romantic sublime, with its adulation of the pastoral, was in part a counterpoint to the rise of industrial capitalism. Wandering lonely as a cloud tended to take you well away from the madding crowd and into the verdant wood to listen to the birdsong. When Wordsworth does stand on Westminster Bridge and look out over London (back in 1802), he makes sure it’s first thing, before everyone is up and around and making a racket: “This City now doth, like a garment, wearThe beauty of the morning silent, bareShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the skyAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.”Even in the post-industrial landscape, where the clatter and clamour of factories has given way to the constant chatter of mobile phones and annoying ringtones, we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountain. We want to get off the grid for a change. Switch off all the notifications. Leave an “on vacation” message on email. It’s like those telescopes that are installed on top of remote island peaks or in the Atacama desert\u0026nbspto get away from all the artificial light. You’re not excluding light altogether, you’re just trying to focus on a point. So too we seek to escape the noise with some notion of getting a clearer signal from the great beyond. I imagine even GCHQ surveillance wallahs eventually take the headphones off and stop listening in to all those myriad conversations taking place every minute of the day, clandestine or not.Considering the history of the universe, the Big Bang was actually the most peaceful event ever (and here I have to depart from Alain Corbin’s last-page shoutout to the “noise” of the Big Bang) because there was as yet no medium for conveying sound. Nor was there anyone around to lend an ear anyway. As the tagline of Alien used to says:\u0026nbsp“In space, no one can hear you scream”.\u0026nbspWomen driven to suicidal thoughts over ‘callous’ pension age changeHow a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityThere is a case for the music of the spheres. The whole of time and space is vibrating with gravitational waves, which are audible, so in this sense silence is an illusion. But noise is more of a human speciality, and the desire for serenity has risen alongside it. I just heard on the radio – maybe I should have turned it off? – Nicky Campbell denouncing as “pathetic… mollycoddling” the decision by Manchester University students to ban clapping and whooping, but I get that. It’s akin to mystics going off into the wilderness in their quest for the ine. They haven’t banned beer yet.I have a talkative friend who has joined a Talkaholics Anonymous group. I guess she’s getting on pretty well because I haven’t heard from her for a long time. The recurrent catchphrase of Lee Child’s novels, “Reacher said nothing”, is a mute testimony to our sense that, at a certain point, you have to turn off the tap and call a halt to the wisecracks and witticisms and Boris-Johnsonian bluster and speechifying.\u0026nbspBut I understand the fear of silence. “The rest is silence.” It’s the tragic end of Act 5. It feels like RIP. Silence is spooky. Even the deeply contemplative Pascal, who prided himself on being able to remain at rest in a room, could look up into the night sky and fear “the eternal silence of these infinite spaces”. I couldn’t sign up as a Trappist monk. Even going off on one of those silent retreats would test me to breaking point. How long could I stand it? Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the word.I can think of one guy who regularly used to lapse into silence, sometimes for days on end, as an alternative to the blazing row. I don’t blame his wife for leaving him. Coercive silence can sometimes be as much of an assault on the person as too many decibels.But there has to be scope for voluntary and consensual silence. Nietzsche once defined marriage as “a long conversation”, which is fine, but there have to be times (curled up in front of the fire, walking down the street arm in arm) when the conversation stops and silence descends like grace, as soundless as snow falling. Silence (whisper it) is the language of love. Or as Wittgenstein so neatly put it:\u0026nbsp“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child\u0026nbspand the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at Cambridge University.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business\u0027, says European Council presidentClick to followIndy PoliticsThe EU has told the UK to stop “wasting time” and find a solution to the Irish border row, with just two weeks until the next showdown summit over Brexit.Donald Tusk, the European Council president, turned his fire on Jeremy Hunt for likening the EU to the Soviet Union – accusing ministers of rousing the Tory faithful, instead of striving to reach an agreement.“Unacceptable remarks that raise the temperature will achieve nothing except wasting more time,” Mr Tusk said.French government says no-deal Brexit would be better than Chequers“I was a party leader myself for 15 years, so I know what the rules of party politics are. But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business.”Speaking alongside\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish president, Mr Tusk made clear the EU remained “united behind Ireland” in its determination to prevent a return to border posts and checks.But he also made clear his anger at the delay to Theresa May’s promised fresh border proposals – linking it to a reluctance to risk a backlash at the Tory conference.In Birmingham, Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, triggered fury across the EU by accusing it of trying to keep the UK in a “prison” with behaviour similar to the Soviet Union.After the Salzburg summit, the prime minister accused Mr Tusk of showing disrespect, but he tuned that accusation on the UK, saying: “In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return.“Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That will let people know how they are connected to WiFi, for instance, and tell them whether they should expect faster or slower speeds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

BREXIT BOMBSHELL: HMRC not preparing small traders for no-deal\u0026ldquoThe Unilever management had been acting in self interest to protect their jobs from a takeover but the shareholders knew that they needed access to London not Holland.\u0026ldquoThis is a slap in the face for the management of Unilever but also those who peddle Project Fear in this country.In reference to the companies products, he added: \u0026ldquoBrexit Britain clearly passes the Marmite test and this news will be of great Comfort to many in Britain.\u0026ldquoThe management\u0026rsquos analysis clearly didn\u0026rsquot cut the mustard and I suggest they get over it and go and have a cup of PG Tips.Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u0026ldquoBritain passes the Marmite test. After the announcement that Unilever is keeping its headquarters in London, this is another massive vote of confidence in the UK after Brexit.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a clear sign that successful businesses see a bright future in Brexit Britain.When Unilever initially announced its decision to move its headquareers from Britain, Remainers seized on the announcement that it was a sign big companies were fleeing because of brexit.However, it has become the latest example of a company making an empty threat with the prospect of a no deal with BMW also admitting earlier this year that it would not quit Britain.The announcements have come after remorseless campaigning by Remainers to try to undermine the credibility of Britain after Brexit and claims it would \u0026ldquocrash out if there is no deal and have to rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.However, expects at Economists for Free Trade have pointed out that a no deal situation could boost Britain by \u0026pound1 trillion while hitting the EU by \u0026pound500 billion.There are also government plans revealed this week by the  to slash corporation tax and personal income tax in Britain to compete hard with the EU in the event of no deal.                Key problem with plans to reverse Brexit that Remainers will HATE                Brexit news: Northern Irish Remainers accuses May of pandering to DUPUnilever has throughout insisted the move to Rotterdam was nothing to do with Brexit (Image: ADRIAN DENNIS)Unilever said that it was withdrawing a proposal to simplify its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch legal structure, which would have seen its corporate base move to the Netherlands.It follows pressure applied by several shareholders over the past few weeks.Those voicing their disdain included Royal London, Columbia Threadneedle, Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management, Aviva Investors, Lindsell Train, M\u0026ampG Investments and Brewin Dolphin.Unilever said on Friday: We have had an extensive period of engagement with shareholders and have received widespread support for the principle behind simplification.However, we recognise that the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore consider it appropriate to withdraw.Had the move gone ahead, Unilever\u0027s shares were unlikely to have continued trading on the FTSE 100.Chairman Marijn Dekkers said that the board continues to believe simplifying Unilever\u0027s structure is in the firm\u0027s best interests.Thousands take to the streets of London for Brexit march.                    PA1 of 21People took to the streets of London to march for a second EU referendumHe said: Unilever has built a long track record of consistent and competitive performance. The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever.The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders. We will proceed with the plan to cancel the NV preference shares, further strengthening our corporate governance.Unilever first announced plans to simplify the business from two legal entities into a single one, incorporated in Rotterdam, in March.It dealt a major blow to the UK Government and its efforts to uphold Britain\u0027s status as a centre for business after Brexit.However, Unilever has throughout insisted the move to Rotterdam was nothing to do with Brexit.It also said at the time that its 7,300 workers in the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands would be unaffected by the changes.A spokesman for the Investment Association said: The feedback from many of our members has been that there was no compelling reason for Plc shareholders to accept the proposed simplification in this form. They did not believe it would be in the long-term interests of their clients, and would have resulted in many shareholders being forced to sell their shares.We welcome the fact that Unilever has listened to the feedback from their shareholders and not pushed ahead with their plans. We look forward to engaging with the company on their future plans.Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Unilever has a long and proud history in the UK and I welcome this decision by Unilever\u0027s board having listened to its shareholders. Keeping Unilever\u0027s HQ in the UK builds on two of its three global businesses being based here.The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters.

They are thought to come from clusters of massive stars.Billions of the particles shower the earth every day, and physicists believe they are capable of penetrating the Earth\u0026rsquos surface.But according to the Standard Model, they should not be able to pass all the way through the planet and shoot out of the other side.Cosmic rays are thought to be produced by clusters of massive stars (Image:  IMAGES)Last month, a research paper from a group of researchers led by the Pennsylvania State University physicist Derek Fox proposed a new theory for the strange particles detected by ANITA.The study suggests that the rays picked up by the balloon were in fact the first evidence of supersymmetric particles.Mr Fox acknowledged that the theory is just one interpretation of the strange data recorded by ANITA, according to Motherboard.But the researchers also analysed much more comprehensive data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in the Arctic and discovered three occurrences of the phantom particles.A research paper suggests the rays detected in Antarctica could have passed through the Earth (Image:  IMAGES)The researchers are now hoping to gather more data from ANITA\u0026rsquos most recent mission in 2016.Of the study, Mr Fox said: \u0026ldquoFrom my perspective, I go trawling around trying to discover new things about the universe, I come upon some really bizarre phenomenon, and then with my colleagues, we do a little literature search to see if anybody has ever thought that this might happen.\u0026ldquoAnd then if we find papers in the literature, including one from 14 years ago that predict something just like this phenomenon, then that gets really high weight from me.

Security and criminal checks would be completed before a visitor arrives in the UK.Long-term workers will also be required to earn a minimum amount to cut competition for low-skilled jobs that could be filled by workers from the UK.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Where are you parked  It’s best in a car.She then whispered that she offered punters the chance to touch her all over for twenty quid.One mum shook her head in despair as she walked her little boy to school.She said: “I work in one of the shops and they are often there when I go to work at eight in the morning after I take my boy to school. It’s terrible.”Meanwhile, other horried locals said they are regularly approached as early as am as they make their way to work.Funeral director Steve Smith, , claims he was solicited while standing at a cash machine before starting work.He told The Sun Online: “I was stood outside the bank and she said: ‘Are you looking for business “I thought that was funny since I am in the funeral business. She was a bit young to end up in a box.“I was wearing my suit and funeral gear and she was dressed in a pair of shorts and a crop top so it was a really bizarre thing to happen at am.Just four years ago, Hull became the first UK city to create a prostitute-free zone, meaning people caught loitering, soliciting or having sex in the area could be arrested and charged.However, the ban has done little to deter the problem, and residents now claim as many as  to  prostitutes tout the streets every day.Newsagent Jo Thirkettle, , said: “They wear skirts like belts, hot pants and other revealing stuff.“They come into the shop asking the customers ‘Do you want business ’ When I tell them to go outside they go after blokes using the cash machine.“They don’t charge very much because people around here can’t afford much anyway.Many of the girls take their customers to an open car park behind the shops which is littered with condoms, cigarette butts, empty beer cans and smashed spirits bottles.Some are even said to be using a disused phone box for sex, often leaving their business cards behind along with condoms, syringes and other drugs paraphernalia.There are seven primary schools within a mile radius of the road - Adelaide, Newington Academy, Hessle Penhurst, Francis Askew, Wheeler, Chiltern and St Georges Primary - as well as two nurseries.A local shop owner, who did not wish to be named, said: There have been prostitutes down here for decades.“They seem to come go – sometimes they are at one end of the street and sometimes at the other.Then they will disappear altogether for a few weeks trying a dferent area. But they always come back.“You’ll see them arguing among themselves about pitches and where they should stand.“I’ve seen them here when I start opening up at am.”Last year, the police launched a clampdown on the notorious spot.Coppers caught  kerb crawlers approaching prostitutes over a three-month period,  of them were then slapped with section  orders, banning them from the area.Councillor Daren Hale insists everything is being done to clampdown on the number of sex workers which “causes misery for residents.”Inspector Kirsty Tock, of the Hull central community policing team, said: “Hessle Road remains our main focus and, at the moment, we are tackling those seeking out sex workers.“We are continuing to carry out patrols and using the injunctions to prevent prostitution on Hull’s streets.“We have changed our approach recently and are using plain-clothes officers and now punters are feeling the full force of these section  orders.We are also using CCTV to collect further evidence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000439038144-e1538602636221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"conservative party brexit unity rod liddle opinion","story":"I don’t think Theresa May is going to be on Strictly any time soon. Whoever convinced her it would be dead cool to walk on stage at the party conference and jig about to an Abba song needs a bit of invasive brain surgery, right now.It was like a remake of Re-Animator, or Night Of The Living Dead.There’s no point in Theresa trying to tell us she’s the le and soul of the party and actually a bloody good laugh.We know she isn’t. She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose. And you’ll wake up to find John McDonnell is in charge of your finances and Diane Abbott is Home Secretary.Come on — surely that should concentrate the mind a little Hero of the week is Jane Lunnon, head of a girls’ school in South London.She has stuck the boot into “image-obsessed” reality TV – especially that coven of gurning and pouting imbeciles in Love Island, such as Megan Barton Hanson.Such programmes are “incredibly damaging” to young people, she reckons, calling them “trivial nonsense”.I think Jane is right. And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers. She says they didn’t give spectators enough protection.This is ludicrous. What were they supposed to do And what will happen is that in future crowds will be kept even further back from the action. Just because of one horrible accident.Wait until the same thing happens in cricket...The uni magazine said: “It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression.”With anxiety or sensory issues  What is wrong with these people They are “triggered” by almost everything.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that.

a ready meal paella - picked up his shotgun and drove to the local leisure centre, where he murdered his we Claire and daughter Charlotte in cold blood.With a rambling -page note in hand, in which he attempted to justy the slaughter of his family - “I had to do this… Revenge is a dish best served cold” - he then shot himself.It came as a bloody end to a campaign of abuse that lasted years, with Lance taking every chance he could to inflict emotional wounds on his family.His relentless bullying had become so bad that Luke and Ryan, now  and , had helped their -year-old sister and mum to escape from the family home, in Spalding, Lincolnshire, just days before the killings.And now the brothers - who have recently written a book about their ordeal - know the terrying truth: their evil father had been planning to butcher his entire family all along.In his murder note, Lance, a builders merchant, claimed he “had to” kill Claire because she and Charlotte had decided to leave him.But police found drafts of it on his laptop from long before they’d left the family home - a desperate move they had been forced to make five days earlier, fearing for their safety.“We want to get across that our dad didn’t kill because of a reaction to something. It wasn’t emotional. It was planned,” Ryan tells The Sun.“He was writing drafts of his murder note at least a month before we decided to move out.“So we were sitting there with him as he was typing up a note about killing us.“I think he’d always had it in the back of his mind that he would kill us when we were no longer useful to him.”“He used to march around the house at night, he says. And that’s exactly what witnesses said he did before he shot himself. So at home he was clearly trying to work himself up.”Before the day of the murder, Lance didnt physically attack his family, but he did coercively control them - taking charge of every aspect of their lives.However, it was only after they lost their mum and sister that the brothers discovered this kind of non-violent domestic abuse is more likely to turn deadly than violent domestic abuse.“We thought he’d start hitting us and we’d know this is getting lethal,” says Luke.But that never happened.The brothers childhood was spent in the Cambridgeshire countryside, living under their fathers bizarre and oppressive tyranny.“We were poor. We grew our own food. We were almost like Russian peasants,” said Luke.Lance didn’t have any friends, except on forums online, and he didn’t want Claire to have any either.But she was naturally friendly and managed to make connections in the community.Unhappy that his we was defying his control, Lance moved his family to a small village outside Spalding in Lincolnshire so fast that nobody knew where they had gone, and his behaviour escalated.Claire started working in Morrisons but he made her hand over her wages, rationing them back to her.Meanwhile she’d look after the children and complete lists of chores he’d leave round the house for her, including filling up his car - that only he drove.The one time she had a friend around he sat in the neighbouring room listening.“If he could keep her busy she had no time to see other people or build a le,” says Luke.“It was part of his isolation strategy.”Ryan remembers arbitrary rules becoming a normal aspect of their lives.“We got the bus back from school, ing at . nearly on the dot every day. Dinner was ready at ..If we were late, which we always would be, we’d be shouted at.“He wanted to find ways to attack us - whether they were legitimate or not.”The brothers realise now that their father saw them as competition.“He only ever got involved in our lives to try to hinder us,” says Ryan. “He liked humiliating us.”So the boys learned to never express an opinion or question anything.They didn’t make friends - too scared for them to come around and face Lance - and spent all their time silently doing homework.“Our le was a prison. We never had an identity,” says Luke.They were also followed around the home by their dad.“In winter we didn’t have the heating on except in the living room to force everyone in there, says Ryan.“If we moved he would sneak around and follow us, adds Luke.He would break into the toilet sometimes just to keep an eye on us.”He’d even secretly stalk Claire to her work at Morrisons, spying on her to see who she was talking to.But bright Luke and Ryan figuredthey could ace their exams it would lead to earning good salaries: a means of escape for their mum and Charlotte.After getting straight A*s, Luke went to Warwick University, and Ryan Durham, and they worked as engineers after graduating.“Going to uni was the first time ever I’d been able to relax. I realised people were actually quite nice, says Ryan. “That’s when I started to think we could live a better le.”Five days before the murders, in a terrying two-hour window before their dad came back from work for his lunch, Luke and Ryan moved Claire out of the family home into a house theyd found.“We were on edge. We knew we had to get out by  and we just made it,” says Ryan.Claire left Lance lunch and a note saying she’d left and would email him later.They’d planned to meet on Monday to exchange documents so she wasn’t surprised to see him the car park of the leisure centre - but she didnt expect him to be holding a gun.“When he realised his control had gone that’s when he decided to kill us all,” says Luke.The brothers were both away when it happened, but remember the sickening sense of dread they felt when they turned on the news.They believe the only reason he didnt kill them too was because they were away, and Luke adds that he is unsure his dad ever loved them.“I think it’s impossible to love when you hate,” he says.“And I think he always wanted to die. I think really violent men inherently become very reckless and self-destructive.”In the months after the murders, Luke started writing to process his feelings, and has now published a book, Operation Lighthouse.Named after the police’s name for the case, the book is a rallying cry for society to act on domestic abuse - and they hope it will help people recognise the signs of coercive control.However, the brothers say the emphasis shouldn’t be on the woman escaping because this can be near-impossible.“The abuser takes financial resources away, isolates you from friends and family, takes your work away, destroys your esteem and then you have nothing, explains Luke.So how do you escape  You have literally nothing. That’s the problem.Their mum and sister couldnt have been more dferent to Lance.Claire,  when she was killed, cared about other people so deeply that she had learned sign language to speak to one customer who she saw for just a few minutes a week.Charlotte, meanwhile, used to spend her time volunteering with the elderly and disabled.“They were angels and our father was evil,” says Luke.A lot of families are plagued by these behaviours eventhey’re not lethal, he adds. They still ruin people’s lives.“So we’re trying to start a conversation and make as much noise as we can.”Operation Lighthouse: Reflections on our Familys Devastating Story of Coercive Control and Domestic Homicide is out now, independently published, Amazon £..Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t like taking out bricks.“Will the mortar chip out, or will the bricks crumble  Will the [honey] combs be usable once the bricks are out of the way  As much as I dreaded removing the bricks the final view of the hive was AWESOME!“The homeowner was more than pleased that we were able to remove and relocate the bees and their hive.”Incredible images and video footage helped the beekeeper identy where the bees may be living before proving it with an infrared picture and then starting to remove the bricks.As he removed more bricks he began to uncover a huge honeycomb beneath a window, which remained intact.After safely removing it, Glover pointed out the stain left behind by thousands of tiny bee feet walking on the white surface.He explained to Bored Panda: “Step-by-step the area of the home is opened, and all combs removed. Brood combs are rubber banded into hive frames and honey goes into a bucket .“If the homeowner is willing to eat a piece of comb with me, it’s probably never been sprayed. The bees who do not follow the combs into the new hive box are vacuumed into a two-stage vacuum. They are added back to the new hive once they are set up in their new yard.After the Bee Whisperer rescues bees, he uses them to repopulate empty hive boxes for local beekeepers who have suffered colony losses.He added: “No one is aware of the size of their honey bee hive. They are all surprised because they are expecting something the size of a wasp nest or hornet’s nest.“The infrared gives them the first clue, but that’s only the brood combs of the hive.The babies are incubated at . degrees Celsius. Any honey combs in the hive are cooler and usually don’t show on the IR.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000250345507.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"asshat douchebaggery and fam among 1400 new phrases added to oxford dictionary sparking controversy","story":"Other controversial additions, which were announced today, include douchebaggery, asshat, updation and Pooh-sticks.A surprising number of slang words have also made it into the dictionary - most notably the phrase bump and grind, which OED describes as a dancers erotic gyration of the hips.Among the slang words set to appear on the pages of the dictionary is butters, an adjective commonly used to describe someone or something as ugly.Another on the list is bum-suck, which is a colloquialism for a brown nose or suck up.

Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and a former Unilever employee, did his bit to smooth the way by promising to abolish a tax on idends that made holding the shares in the UK more attractive than in the Netherlands.One by one, the big battalions of City fund managers, many of whom prefer to speak on an anonymous basis to the financial press, broke cover to say what a dreadful idea this was: Colombia Threadneedle, Lindsell Train, Schroders, Aviva Investors, MG and Royal London all publicly stated their opposition.

Two crucial senators said that the sexual misconduct accusations against the judge would not prevent them from voting to confirm him. Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin, both seen as swing votes, said they would support Kavanaugh, after weeks of debate about sexual violence and the nominees character and temperament that gripped the nation. Sen. Collins, from Maine, sparked a furious backlash which saw more than million raised to challenge her in the  election within hours of her vote. She addressed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and last weeks Senate hearing regarding the assault allegations brought against Kavanaugh.  She told the Senate committe: I found her testimony to be sincere, painful and compelling. I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her le. Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events.  Collins also mentioned the #MeToo movement, brought about a year ago following accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She said: The #MeToo Movement is real. It matters. It is needed, and it is long overdue.  A sharply partisan battle over the nomination became an intense personal and political drama when university professor Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students in Maryland in . Collins, in remarks on the Senate floor explaining her decision to back Kavanaugh, said Fords accusations against him fail to meet the more-likely-than-not standard.  As protesters in a Capitol Hill hallway shouted, Shame! Shame! Shame!, Manchin told reporters an FBI investigation, which did not find corroborating evidence of Fords accusations, was thorough. “I believe Dr. Ford. Something happened to Dr. Ford. I don’t believe the facts show that it was Brett Kavanaugh, but I believe something happened,” Manchin said.  Earlier on Friday afternoon in the US, the Senate voted - in favour of his nomination. The final vote on whether the -year-old will get a lelong seat in the highest court in the US is set to be announced later today.  President Donald Trump tweeted: Very proud of the U.S. Senate for voting “YES” to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh! Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the role by President Trump, has denied the sexual assault allegations during a dramatic marathon hearing in front of a Senate committee. His fate might still be in the hands of a few key senators in a chamber where Republicans hold only a razor-thin majority. Confirmation would hand President Trump a clear victory and tip the balance on the court to a - majority in favour of conservatives in possible legal battles ahead over contentious issues such as abortion rights and immigration. On Thursday evening, actresses Emily Ratajkowski and Amy Schumer were arrested while protesting against Kavanaughs nomination. The stars, along with more than  others, were detained by police as they took to the streets in Washington DC. Ratajkowski shared a photograph of herself in front of the US Capitol brandishing a sign reading Respect female existence or expect our resistance. She wrote on Twitter: I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power.  Schumer is also a vocal supporter against controversial Kavanaugh being appointed to the highest court in the land when the vote is carried out this weekend. She previously wrote on Twitter: We BelieveSurvivors and refuse to accept Brett Kavanaugh as our next Supreme Court Justice.” She encouraged others to join protests across America. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard emotional testimony from Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers.  University professor Dr Ford fought back tears before the Senate Judiciary committee as she said Kavanaugh assaulted her at a High School party when she was  and he . I believed he was going to rape me, she declared. She said she tried to yell for help but Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. He and a friend of his were drunkenly laughing during the attack, she added.  Dr Ford said she could not remember the location or exact date of the incident  years ago, but said she was  per cent sure it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her. Two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, have accused conservative Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the s. But in an angry, extraordinary statement at the committee, Kavanaugh blasted Democratic senators and accused opponents of a calculated and orchestrated political hit.  Calling himself a victim of grotesque and obvious character assassination, Kavanaugh said he unequivocally and categorically denied Fords allegation. I swear today, under oath, before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge, he said. The protest in the US capital city last night took place after senators were given a report by the FBI which investigated the allegations made against Kavanagh and which Republicans have said proves there was no wrongdoing. Last night Kavanaugh also took the highly unusual step for a judge of penning a Wall Street Journal opinion piece denying the claims against him.

Bloc chiefs hope to strike a deal in Brussels in less than two weeks, before rubber-stamping the pact at a one-off meeting in November. Mr Juncker hoped October’s European Council summit would make “enough progress” that “we can see it through in November”. No deal would be “devastating”, he added. Mrs May was under mounting pressure tonight to bring forward plans to break the deadlock over the Northern Ireland border. Dublin’s Europe Minister Helen McEntee was confident a deal could be struck, but warned negotiations were reaching a “critical point”. Mrs May rejected the EU’s proposal for a “backstop” to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit.

In the next few weeks the Brexit negotiations will reach their final stage.Can Theresa May strike a deal  And,so, what happens then The Prime Minister still has to reach a compromise with Brussels on her unloved Chequers plan .Then she has to present the deal to Parliament for MPs’ approval. The stakes could not be higher. Hundreds of thousands of jobs, our national security and economic well-being depend on what happens. Any  step by the Prime Minister and it could spell the end of her time in office. Here’s your guide to a crucial few weeks: What is the next stage   Britain and the EU will resume the Brexit negotiations next week after the stalemate at Salzburg.At the Austrian summit Mrs May’s Chequers plan was bluntly rejected as unworkable.The EU said it did not resolve the Irish border issue and her trade proposals gave Britain access to EU markets without having to abide by the rules on free movement of goods, people and services. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to travel to Brussels on Monday to try to break the deadlock. On Wednesday  the President of the EU Jean-Claude Juncker is scheduled to make a declaration on the future trading relationship with the UK. Many believe he will offer the UK a Canada +++with a carve out on Northern Ireland. When will a decision be made   Mrs May will join EU leaders on Wednesday  for a working dinner on Brexit, migration and foreign policy. The following day will be the moment of truth. This is when we will discoverboth sides have found a way to resolve their dferences and have the basis for a potential agreement. If there a deal is in the offing then there will be another summit, pencilled in for November , to sign it off. How could the deadlock be broken   The simple answer is through a large amount of fudge and kicking the contentious issues into the long grass.Theresa May could agree to stick to EU rules on trade and goods to allow the UK to stay in a customs union after the transition period ends in .This would give us more time to bring in the technology needed to allow for frictionless trade across borders. But this would limit our ability to strike independent trade deals - the main prize in the eyes of the Brexiteers of our leaving. To resolve the Irish border question Britain could agree for Northern Ireland to have dferent regulations from the rest of the UK with the checks on goods taking place away from ports, borders and airports.This will require the agreement of the DUP which has been adamant there can be no border in the Irish Sea. Theresa May is expected to presents her plans to Parliament at the end of November or early December. MPs have been offered a meaningful vote on the final deal. What happens depends on who is best at counting. Labour has signalled it would vote down any deal unless it meets all six of its demands.The question for Jeremy Corbyn is what happensMrs May brings back a package which is within a whisker of passing his party’s six tests.The ultimate prize for the Labour leader is for Parliament to vote down Mrs May’s deal paving the way for a general election. But Mr Corbyn has to weigh up the cost of being seen to block what voters may regard as a sensible deal. If Labour does vote against the agreement the Prime Minister will have to rely on a handful of Labour Brexiteers to get it over the line.But they could be outweighed by the diehard Tory Brexiteers who have vowed to block Chequers including Jacob Rees-Mogg , Boris Johnson and Owen Paterson.There is also a risk that one or two Tory remainer MPs may side with Labour. Allies of Mrs May are still confident she can get a deal through Parliament. They believe that when forced to make a decision Tory Brexiteers would rather swallow the Prime Minister’s offering which they can unpick later than risk losing the prize of Brexit altogether. Tory remainers could also drop their objections rather than unleash the chaos which could lead to Jeremy Corbyn coming to power. What we do know is that when the vote comes the numbers will be nail-bitingly tight. What happensthe deal is voted down by Parliament   The short answer is nobody knows. Theresa May would be under immense pressure to resign. MPs would have to conjour up a motion that called on the Prime Minister to go back to the negotiating table.With time running out we would also have to ask for an extension of Article  which set the timetable for our departure.Extending Article  requires the unanimous approval of all  other EU states. They are likely to agree rather than allow the UK to crash out without a deal but we don’t know what price,any, they will demand for such a favour. The EU would have us over a barrel: the options would be the economically ruinous crashing out with no deal or bowing to Brussels in order to get an extension.

The boy and three friends had been able to easily gain access to a Tyne Yard railway depot, in Gateshead, which was a common haunt for youngsters. A company has now been found guilty of a safety breach after the schoolboy was set on fire and lost his legs and seven fingers following a rail yard electrocution. A jury found freight operator DB Cargo guilty of failing to protect people from risk, Chronicle Live reports.  A disused signal box known as the “haunted house” was a popular attraction to children at the site, near Birtley, and prosecutors said inadequate measures were in place to keep people off the premises. When two lads began climbing up a wagon, one of them got too close to the live overhead wire and suffered catastrophic injuries. During the trial at Newcastle Crown Court, prosecutor Gordon Menzies said the railway yard was a potentially hazardous area by nature but added: “It was made much more dangerous by the fact that in this yard, on the defendant’s land which it leased from Network Rail, there was a signal box which had not been used since . “It had a reputation among local children and was known as the haunted house. It was something of a lure to not just young children but older children as well.  “The prosecution say the dangers those children were exposed to arise because of the inadequacies of the defendant’s arrangements for keeping that site secure. “It was a hazardous area and was left insecure.” The court heard access to the yard, which is off the East Coast Mainline, could be gained by four bridges off Lamesley Road, near Birtley. Two of them had been safely fenced off but the third had a gate which did not lock properly, while a fourth did not have any gate to prevent pedestrian access, Mr Menzies said. On Saturday June  , two boys and two girls aged between  and , who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to the yard to go to the signal yard. DB Cargo had denied failing to ensure non-employees, including the four children, were not exposed to risk. Mr Menzies told jurors: “There was not a single fence or credible obstacle to prevent them getting to the haunted house and being exposed to the risks that were involved.Mums terror of dragging her children out of bed after home was set on fire in arson attack“There was no security patrol present, there weren’t even any warning signs on the bridge to provide even that minimal level of deterrent. “The prosecution say this was an obvious trespassing route.” After spending time in the signal box, the children began to explore the yard and played on large piles of rubble. The two boys started to climb up a railway wagon in the sidings and one reached the top but suffered an electric shock after getting too close to the overhead cables. It is not necessary to even touch them in order to get an electric shock, jurors heard. His -year-old friend behind him also suffered an electric shock and was thrown to the ground but escaped with minor injuries. Mr Menzies said: “The children described a loud bang andwas thrown to the ground. “ was set on fire and fell to the ground. “He suffered le-changing injuries, including the amputation of both of his legs, one above he knee, one below, and all the fingers and thumb on his right hand, and on his left hand two fingers and part of his left hand itself.”  Prosecutors said DB Cargo did not do enough to ensure people were not exposed to risk. One of the youngsters said for a time she would go there every day and prosecutors say the signal box was a “den”, which the company denies. DB Cargo had arranged security patrols of the signal box but only at night on weekdays, the court heard. It also put up warning signs but pictures showed these had been ripped off. Its own risk assessments showed it was a high risk environment, the court heard. Referring to the children going to the sidings, Mr Menzies said: “There was nothing to stop them, no security guards, none of the staff stopped them, there’s no CCTV in that area. “They were able to roam about half a mile from where they entered the site.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fantasist posed woman lure straight","story":"NewsFantasist posed as woman to lure straight men into having sex with him wearing blindfoldDepraved Duarte Xavier, , trawled dating sites masquerading as Ana where he chatted to scores of heterosexual men and sent them saucy photosShareBySam Corbishley:,  OCT NewsXavier invited men to his flat under the pretence he was a woman named Ana \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA fantasist who posed as a woman on dating apps to lure men into having sex with him is facing years behind bars. Depraved Duarte Xavier, , trawled lonely hearts sites masquerading as Ana, chatting to scores of straight men and sending them saucy photos. When they agreed to meet up, Ana set a series of conditions they had to abide by, including a stipulation that they wear a blindfold throughout the liaison. Xaviers first victim, a -year-old man, agreed to a hook up at Anas flat on February   and agreed to cover his eyes in the bedroom. He realised something was wrong when they began having sex and was horried when he whipped off the blindfold and saw Xavier.  The enraged victim stormed out and later received a text from Xavier reading: I got a mental health problem, sorry. On October  , a -year-old man messaged Ana, who told him she was a recently single female looking for a bit of fun. The pair traded flirty messages over WhatsApp and the oblivious victim arranged to meet for sex in a Wandsworth flat hours after they chatted in a video call. When he arrived he heard what he thought was a female voice saying: Stay there, dont take off and dont move the mask. Someone then crept up behind him and pulled the blindfold tighter, Kingston Crown Court heard. He was led into another room where Ana began performing a sex act but the brief encounter ended with disgust when he too removed the face covering. Xavier sent a series of messages to his victim pleading a misunderstanding but continued to pester him for oral sex.  That victim reported the incident to police and Xavier was arrested on October   on suspicion of causing sexual activity with a person without consent. But he was released under investigation. A number of mobile phones and masks were also seized. The third incident took place on April  this year when -year-old Ana lured another man to her darkened flat where she claimed to be concealing her identity so as not to tip off her husband to the fact she was having an affair. As the victim went upstairs, he felt a person grab him and pull his trousers down and throw a pillow case over his head. He asked for confirmation the person he had been talking to was really a woman but Ana told him no and began performing a sex act. But the suspicious date used his phone torch to check and was so horried he marched straight out to call the police.  Xavier was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and later charged with two counts of causing a male aged  or over in a penetrative sexual activity and sexual assault. He was remanded and later bailed at Wimbledon Magistrates Court.His fourth victim was only identied by police after reviewing phone records from seized mobile phones. The -year-old had been too humiliated to tell anyone of the encounter. Following their introduction in December , Ana explained that she was looking for a role play experience where the victim would be blindfolded. Both parties exchanged pictures and videos and agreed to meet at Anas address before she claimed her landlady would be home and they must meet where. Ana told the victim they would meet in King Georges Park, in Wandsworth, at around pm on December . Despite chatting in a video call and phoning to check he was heading the right way, the man had no reason to suspect Ana was actually a man.  He went to the agreed spot, a secluded area, when Ana arrived and performed a sexual act on him before they had sex. Ana then left and the victim remained entirely unaware he had just had sex with Xavier. WhatsApp records of conversations between the pair revealed that the victim had not realised what had happened and at no point did Xavier reveal his true identity. As a result, the pair arranged to meet again a few days later, on the same terms and same place. This time the victim held off on putting on the blindfold, curious as to who he was meeting. As Xavier approached, the pair saw each other and Xavier tried to hide. When the victim asked what he was doing, Xavier claimed to have believed that the victim was bisexual and approved of the arrangement. Xavier offered to pay his cab fare home, to which the victim said no and that he did not want to be contacted by him ever again. The defendant, of Wandsworth, of south London, was convicted of six counts of causing a male aged  or over to engage in penetrative sexual activity.

This did not breach rules as it was produced by Pret “on site” at Heathrow. All that was needed were warnings posted around the shop and “staff advice”. The coroner said “a cynic might think it was almost a device to get round regulation”.  At Greggs in Peckham, South London, on Thursshyshyday there was a sign listing nutritional information and customers were adshyshyshyvised to “ask about allergens”. The firm said it was “urgently reviewshyshying” the matter and had put up more prominent signs. Currently Wasabi cusshyshytomers are advised to ask for advice.

The st -year-old has a four-bed bay on a ward for himself and all the equipment needed to move him. He is medically fit for discharge, but because there is no appropriate social care space he cannot leave. Crawford, who has convictions for assaulting nurses, has been at the hospital more than five months, costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds. It includes up to pound, a week for a rented reinforced bed. It is claimed he habitually orders pizzas and Chinese takeaways to be eaten on the ward – and he even posted a picture of himself clutching a bottle of champagne. An NHS source said: shy“Everybody is sick to the back teeth with the shysituation and it’s about time it was exposed. There’s nothing medically wrong with Matt now but we’re powerless to get rid of him.  They added: “There’s space for four people who need to be on the ward being taken up by one bloke who doesnt. “He is taking up much-needed bed space that is supposed to be for ill patients. The situation is madness. “The NHS always gets slated for not having enough beds and he’s taking up four. It’s so frustrating. “Staff are at their wits’ end. They are still treating him because they are compassionate and it’s part of their job. But the situation is disrupting the ward and he needs to be moved somewhere more appropriate.” In January, King’s Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts, had to shypostpone more than  non-urgent operations which required overnight stays as it struggled with discharging patients into social care. Earlier this year, Crawford was convicted of assaulting four nurses at a care home near Newark, Notts. He was ordered to pay his victims compensation. His solicitor Michael Little said Crawford, shypreviously convicted of attacking a police officer, was too heavy to attend the hearing.  He told magistrates: “They do have ambulances big enough to support him, but then the consideration becomes how to get him into court.” Crawford was also said to have spent cash from his fortnightly pound Employment Support Allowance on takeaways he ordered from his bed. And he even moaned about the food in the home, posting: “Just want to set the record straight, I don’t spend all my money on takeaways. “I might get  quid a shyfortnight but I spend over  quid every fortnight on food shopping. “If people tasted the food in this place you would know why I buy my own food.” The court was told Crawford had been discharged from the care home weighing st but ed weighing st. He was moved to King’s Mill Hospital in May. Sources said the football fan was sent a discharge letter months ago. But a nationwide lack of appropriate obesity beds means he is still on the ward. His mum Linda Belshaw insisted a deal is being arranged for him to leave. Speaking from her home in Newark, she said: “He’s waiting to move [to a care home]. “Everything including the funding has been sorted. They have got his room ready. They are just waiting for the shyequipment to be installed.” Linda also denied claims by hospital staff that shyCrawford orders takeaways or she brings in food for him. She added: “Do I look like I can carry food  I’m on a walking stick, I’m disabled, I’m a pensioner. “I have to go by voluntary transport to visit him. So it is nonsense. I don’t know who is trying to stir it for him. “He doesnt have any deliveries [of food] whatsoever.” Sherwood Forest Hospitals’ deputy chief nurse, Phil Bolton, refused to comment on shyCrawford’s specic case. He said: “Whenever we have patients in our care with complex needs, it can sometimes take longer than we would like to ensure we can safely transfer patients to a place more shyappropriate for their needs. “In cases where multiple conversations have to take place with dferent agencies across a number of geographical areas, it is more likely that delays can occur. “We continue to work with agencies and the community to identy the most suitable place of care for our patients as quickly as possible, but we appreciate how frustrating this can be for our patients, our staff and our partners.” Bed-blocking costs the cash-strapped NHS millions of pounds every year as operations are postponed or axed.

Royal Mail begged environmental campaigners last month to stop sending bags back to the PepsiCo brand, which owns Walkers, as a form of protest because they arent yet recyclable. Now Walkers has announced the new scheme which is set to be up and running from December. Customers will be encouraged to either drop off their packets at collection points or alternatively post them for free directly to TerraCycle for recycling.  Once the packets have been collected they will be cleaned, shredded and turned into small plastic pellets which will then be converted into useful plastic items, such as benches and fence posts. Under the scheme, developed in partnership with the recycling company TerraCycle, all crisp packets will be accepted. Full details of exactly how it will work and locations of the nationwide collection points will be announced nearer the time. Geraint Ashcroft, whose petition against the Leicester-based crisp maker has been signed by more than , people, said the announcement was really exciting. I hope other snack companies get on board, he said.  This is a great first step and makes all the work thats gone into the petition worthwhile. Walkers’ long-term ambition is to make all of its packaging  per cent recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by . It is focusing signicant resource on developing the technology and infrastructure to make this happen. Ian Ellington, General Manager of PepsiCo UK said: “We share people’s concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging. Our new Walkers recycling initiative starts to tackle this issue right now by repurposing used crisp packets to create everyday items such as plant pots and benches. We hope people will embrace this idea and join us in ensuring crisp packets are recycled.

In a bizarre series of complaints, people living in Gilbert, Minnesota, spotted feathered friends flying into windscreens and trees. It is now thought they could be acting strangely because they are tipsy. Gilberts police chief, Ty Techar, told residents that birds have been feasting on berries - and that cold weather means theyve fermented earlier than usual.In Facebook post he wrote: The Gilbert Police Department has received several reports of birds that appear to be under the influence flying into windows, cars and acting confused. The reason behind this occurrence is certain berries we have in our area have fermented earlier than usual due to an early frost, which is turn has expedited the fermenting process. Many birds have not migrated south, so it appears to be more prevalent than in past years. It appears that some birds are getting more tipsy than normal.  And it added that younger birds are the most likely to be affected by toxins. The Facebook message said: There is no need to call law enforcement about these birds as they should sober up within a short period of time.

Raunchy antics are often ignored by club owners and staff, mostly thanks to the citys open-minded attitudes to sex and drug use. One legendary institution, the KitKatClub, is famous for openly encouraging guests to perform sex acts while on the dancefloor. The techno club hit the news today after one guest picked up bacterial meningitis at the venue last Saturday, sparking a city-wide alert which asked guests to visit doctors for tests. Like Berghain and neighbouring Panorama Bar, these clubs have staunchly refused to clean up their acts despite growing in popularity. Speaking anonymously, one Londoner lted the lid on what really goes on in the sex-obsessed bar after visiting with friends.

One of my friends had heard about the club so we decided we wanted to check it out.After a day of sightseeing, the three lads made their way to the club from their hotel. Following a -minute journey, they arrived at KitKatClub, located in a former industrial section of central Berlin. They knocked on the door which was partially opened by a woman who looked them up and down before they went in. They were initially turned away by staff because the club only admits patrons who wear fetish or bondage gear.  At first we nearly didnt get in because we were wearing normal clothes, he said. But we had the idea of taking our tops off and the guys at the door let us straight in. The man says he couldnt believe his eyes when he stepped through the doors. They were confronted by a small group of clubgoers wearing a iety of outlandish leather clothing. As soon as I got in, the first thing I saw was an overweight middle-aged man being led by young women across the nightclub, he said. We sat down on a sofa where we were given body paint to use all over our body. While we were sitting down a man in a gimp mask approached us. He put his hands down my friends pants, which he wasnt too happy about.

Lothario Chatupoom Losiri posted pictures of several young woman sleeping naked on his bed on Facebook , claiming they had spent the night together. The -year-old also claimed to have bedded a young Russian woman he met outside a grocery store. But furious locals have voiced their fury at his antics, calling for him to be evicted and prompting police to search his home in the Full Moon Party island of Koh Phangan. Despite claims that he lacked decency after his online bragging, no evidence of any wrongdoing was uncovered in the search. Chatupoom calls himself the Thai Caveman - a persona he uses to pick up women.  After posting a picture of a group naked women sleeping, he wrote that he was very tired from the previous evening but still woke up to drink coffee and meditate while they slept. The cavemans antics sparked outrage from locals who accused him of showing a lack of decency after dozens more images emerged of women he had taken back to his cave. Police arrived at the cave, a former tin mine, yesterday and searched for anything suspicious but found nothing. They admitted that Chatupoom had not broken the law but said they would monitor the situation.  Koh Phangan Sherf Kairik Kraisong said: Officials on Koh Phangan have investigated the situation and performed a background check on the person, who was originally domiciled in Bangkok. He graduated with a degree from Silpakorn University. Koh Phangan district has made an inquiry to the landowner whether he will continue to let Mr Chatupoom live in the area or ask him to leave. Now there are no complaints. If there is a complaint, the officers can take legal action. This situation is precarious and risky, so I sent the staff to check and talk with Mr Chatupoom. Speaking to reporters, Chatupoom denied that he had done anything wrong and said that all of the women who visited his cave were there of their own choice.  He said: I came to Koh Phangan to play music but shortly after the band broke up. Now I earn a living by painting art and selling it to tourists. The women who sleep here, there is no compulsion in any way. None of the women are forced to do anything, and sometimes we dont have sex. Sometimes we just hug until morning. They are all happy and Im happy, too.

Matthew and Candise Raison, from Australia, were on holiday in Bali along with his sister Tamzin when they decided to get a relaxing massage. They opted for a go jek massage where the masseur comes to you as the ultimate holiday treat. But Matthew didnt know what the masseur meant when he askedhe wanted him to get the red dragon out of him.  Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Candise said her husband thought the masseur was trying some prayer thing. She told him: I dont know what youre saying but my husband will try anything, go for it! However, they soon found out what the masseur really meant as he started to carve into Matthews back with a coin. The massage is called Gua sha which is an Asian medical practice where the side of a coin is rubbed in parallel stripes on the chest and back. Its often referred to as scraping or coining and is believed to release unhealthy body matter from sore, tired, or injured muscles and stimulate new, oxygenated blood flow.  The red marks ran from the top of his neck all the way down to his tailbone. Despite looking like he had been hurt with the red raised marks covering his back, Matthew and Candise saw the funny side. Its fair to say we were all in tears of laughter, she said. Despite the unsightly appearance, the massage brought Matthew some relief from his chronic back pain.

signed from English National League side Sutton United last summer, has missed the entire start of the season after having ankle surgery.Picking up the injury in the final game of last season, the enigmatic attacker ed for the final six minutes of the club’s first league win of the season – at the seventh time of the asking – at Hamilton and, in the process, set up the second goal.And hiswas hailed by manager Neil McCann.He said: “Roarie Deacon I am really pleased about getting back in because we have suffered some real injury problems of late.“He hadn’t featured at all, he’d only had  minutes of football all season before Saturday but I knew putting him on he could secure the ball because he is so strong.“You can’t get close to Roarie and he turned the boy beautully, then he had the composure.“I have to commend the other boys as well because they were still trying to get into the box at that stage to get the killer goal.”Deacon himself was delighted to be back in action after his y spell out.A process that was extended after an older injury reared its head once more.His debut season was also curtailed by injury with a troublesome thigh problem picked up in December at Hearts keeping him out of action for a big chunk of the middle of the campaign.And, on histo training this season, he hurt the same thigh once more.Deacon said: “I had ankle surgery the first week into pre-season.“I twisted it and damaged ankle ligaments in the game against Partick and through the summer it didn’t heal itself.“The surgeon didn’t want to operate initially but it didn’t heal itself so we made the decision to go under the kne to sort it out.“I was supposed to be back a little earlier than this but on the first session back I re-injured my thigh, a problem I had last season, so I needed a bit of intense rehabilitation on that to get back.“Now, though, I am ready to go and I’m fit.”With goals being a real issue for the side – just four scored in their seven league games and half of them against Accies at the weekend – Deacon’sis a timely boost for the Dark Blues.In fact, he’s only played around six minutes this season but has already had a hand in a quarter of their league goals.Coming into the side struggling for goals and points, though, hasn’t ruffled Deacon in any way.And Dundee fans will be hoping his direct running and ability to go past people is the key that unlocks defences with tough matches against Kilmarnock on Saturday and then Livingston, Hearts and Celtic in the next month.The former Sutton man admits he’s surprised the Dark Blues find themselves bottom of the table as he s to fitness and has backed them to get up the table,they keep doing what they’ve been doing.He added: “I am very surprised, everyone is surprised.“No way we thought we would come in, do well in pre-season, and then come in and after six games not have a point on the board.“However, after Hamilton everyone is positive, you can’t not be because the way we’ve been playing it’s not like we’ve not created chances or played well despite not getting points.“Everyone is buzzing about in training, raring to go and wanting to do well for Dundee.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb72a3da9125.jpg ","title":"celebrity chef nick nairn cooks up a treat at dundee cooking

and BEAR Scotland’s North East Unit have stockpiled salt to the rafters to grit roads and paths from now until April.Following the mighty Beast from the East, which crippled the country’s road networks in March, the teams say they are now ready for anything winter throws at the region.Mark Flynn, deputy convener of Dundee City Council’s city development committee, said the council has stockpiled thousands of tonnes of salt.“We will have , tonnes of salt ready and waiting at the Marchbanks Depot by next week with the ability to bring in moreit is needed,” he said.“When you think that theof roads we have in the city would stretch from here to Birmingham and the pavements that would take you to beyond Exeter, the crews do a tremendous job clearing and gritting.”The council, through arms- body Tayside Contracts, has up to  staff,  road gritters and  footpath spreaders ready to tackle slippy streets.Eight tractors equipped with gritting carts can be called inthe going gets really tough.Gritters will prioritise main roads, later moving onto side streets and cul-de-sacs.Mr Flynn conceded that, as the cold weather bites, locals could be frustrated at a perceived lack of action where they live.However, with about  miles of roads and  miles of pavements to cover – and £. m spent each year on making them safe – he appeals for patience.He added: “It is obviously not possible to clear them all at the same time, particularly in snow conditions when the gritters and ploughs have to treat the same sections of roads and footways more than once.“So during snowy weather you’ll see the fleet of gritters around the city during the day clearing snow, but they’re also active at other times gritting early in the morning or during the night.”Meanwhile, BEAR Scotland is set to treat the trunk roads around Dundee with its army of curiously-named gritters.The firm’s North East Unit will deploy Plougher O’ Scotland, based at Cunmont Depot in Newbigging, should roads such as the A threaten to ice over.Other gritters being deployed across the North East include Gritty Gritty Bang Bang, Sir Grits-a-lot, Sir Andy Flurry and For Your Ice Only.In all, the unit has  machines at

hands of Ross County which, ultimately, spelled the end for Csaba Laszlo.Frans captained the side on the day as Csaba was relieved of his duties as manager in the wake of the Tannadice hammering.His No  Laurie Ellis has taken interim charge and will likely be in the dugout as United travel to Somerset Park to face league leaders Ayr United on Saturday.And, although he is still hurting after the County calamity, Belgian centre-back Frans believes they can bounce back straight away.“People should look at themselves, we don’t need to talk about somebody , we don’t need to talk about the manager or other players,” he said.“We need to look at our own performances and I feel embarrassed.“Especially in an important game like this against one of our title rivals. I can’t remember getting beaten like this.“At half-time there was a lot of emotion, we were trying to get things straight and after the game we’re angry but what can you say  We need to look at ourselves.“It’s easy to look at others and pass the blame on but there is no use in doing that.“We need to stick together.“You always have to be confident, it’s stupid as a football player to think you can’t turn it around. You have to stay positive.“Even though it’s hard to take we have to take it on the chin and go again this weekend.”The -year-old was at a loss to explain what went wrong on Saturday as a Billy Mckay hat-trick and goals from Sean Kelly and Joshua Mullin did the damage for a United side that could only muster one of their own through Pavol Safranko on  minutes.What Frans did accept though, was they need to improvethey want to get the better of the likes of Ross County and others now above them in the race for the Championship title.The Terrors lie in fourth, five points behind leaders Ayr and Frans feels they can learn a thing or two from their promotion rivals.“Sometimes it’s hard to explain in football, you get so much confidence and then this happens. It comes from nowhere,” he added.“I think we started really well. We had a great chance at the beginning and, obviously, we miss it. We concede a stupid goal on a set-piece where we need to be smarter.“We get back into the game with a great goal and, in that moment, I thought we were OK but again we concede a stupid goal again with a cross from the side.“Even then at - it’s bad but I thought ‘look we’ve got  minutes to turn it round’ and then we concede quite early.“The red card for Stewart Murdoch finished it. It’s easy to blame it on mentality but with the goals we conceded it’s about quality as well.“It’s about being smart. That’s what theydid better on Saturday, they were more dirty, more street-wise and we’re too nice.“I can’t blame boys, especially during the week in training, for effort because we train really hard butyou see the game on Saturday it’s logical for the first thing people question to be mentality.“You can run as much as you want butyou don’t do the basics and take a hold of the ball,you don’t pick up your man, simple things like that you’ll lose the game.”Frans apologised to fans, saying: “There’s not much we can say to the supporters, just sorry. I know it’s cheap to say but there is no excuse.

It’s time we started scoring first.”Stars were dealt a fresh injury blow during their midweek game against Cardf and now have two players on the treatment table.Matt Bissonnette’s back injury is still causing the Canadian forward a problem.

It’s a long drive but we should be ready for them.“We know Guildford are a fast team with skills. They score a lot of goals.“Again, we’ll have to re-evaluate ourselves for these two matches.”One player who Pacha will definitely be looking to keep his scoring run going is Jordan Cownie.The Dundonian has been finding the net on a regular basis and put in a Man-of-the-Match performance with his double against the defending champions on Wednesday.However, the -year-old’s copy book was blotted when he was sin-binned seconds into sudden death overtime, which undoubtedly contributed to Devils’ winner.Pacha was still sore about that soft hooking call but in no way blamed the young centre for his part in the defeat.The coach said with a wry smile: “I guess I’ll have to tell Cownie to stop working out and, at ft in and weighing around lbs, dragging out a guy at ft in and getting a penalty!”Sunday’s face-off is at the earlier family-friendly time of pm, with meals being served in the small bar from pm until the start of the game.

failures ndash costing not only more time for officers but lots more money from the councilrsquos budget, he said. ldquoIn addition to meeting administration costs, Highland Council is also having to burden the cost of rent arrears which have shot through the roof because of theof time people and landlords have to wait for payments. It simply cannot go on.According to figures obtained by Mr Hendry, the council spent pound, between - to administer universal credit but only received pound, from the government, leaving a gap of pound,.The figures also showed more than half the councilrsquos pound. million in rent arrears was directly attributable to the new system.Mr Hendry warned with nearly , people in the Highlands still to be transferred to universal credit the bill would continue to rise.Councillor Davidson also wrote to Ms McVey in August seeking full reimbursement of the costs but is still awaiting a reply.ldquoThe council continues to support claimants who are impacted by universal credit as a result of flaws in the system, Cllr Davidson said.But the councilrsquos Conservative leader Andrew Jarvie said lessons had been learned and issues ironed out.ldquoIt is easy to look at headline figures and see the situation gets blown out of all proportion, he said. ldquoPrior to universal credit, housing rent arrears were about pound million.A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said support was provided for claimants as they moved to universal credit while a flexible payment system had been introduced in Scotland.ldquoRent arrears are complicated and they cannot be attributed to a single cause, he said. ldquoOur research shows that many people join universal credit with pre-existing arrears but the proportion of people with arrears falls by a third after four months on universal credit.-Drew Hendry will hold a welfare surgery on Friday for anyone struggling with benefit or welfare issues as part of the Poverty Alliancersquos Challenge Poverty Week.It will take place between noon and pm at Merkinch Community Centre.Other organisations taking part include Highland Council, Citizens Advice Bureau, Inverness Cathedral, Advocacy Highland, Employability Skills and Welfare Project, and MFR Cash for Kids.Saturday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117775.jpg","title":"Inverness streets past preserved by key heritage trail","story":"The new digital heritage trail, a key part of the Inverness Townscape Heritage Project, spent the past two-and-a-half years engaging with the community around Academy Street.During that time some  heritage lsquoengagement eventsrsquo were held and people were invited to share their stories.In the end more than  came forward, representing people such as A.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

There was something for that Orange is the New Black fan, some Riverdale-style Serpent jackets spotted, and the s horror genre is still alive and well, ironically.This year#s convention featured a lot of zombies in costume and in the events.

You want a cupcake that looks like Cookie Monster  An original graphic novel  A Spider-Man bathbomb  You#ll find it.The passion for the arts is the main draw though.

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb.

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act.

The official address is a rented flat in Tottenham Mews in London’s swanky Fitzrovia. The new firm was incorporated as a limited company on September . The nature of the company is listed as “Buying and selling of own real estate.” Fty-two-year-old Eng Huat Ung and Alicia are the only directors and have split the shares.

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she is delighted to see it being implemented so swtly.She said: \"By encouraging people to top up from the tap using refillable bottles, we will help cut down on our use of plastics and promote the benefits of hydration building on Scottish Waters Your Water, Your Le campaign.\"I now look forward to refilling my bottle at the Top Up Tap outside the parliament in the coming months.\"The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers.Water samples will be tested every two minutes, on average, to ensure that quality is maintained.Licensed premises are legally bound to serve tap water on request, yet research shows Scots are uncomfortable asking, something this campaign hopes to change.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810834.1538764436!/image/image.jpg","title":"jane bradley where do you stand on clapping vs jazz hands debate","story":"Jane Bradley really doesn#t like clapping, but doesn#t think we should go as far as replacing it with #jazz hands#.I hate clapping. Organised clapping, at least. My worst nightmare is that bit at the end of a musical or theatre show when the cast decides to perform one of the songs again as an encore and everyone has to stand up and rhythmically pat their hands together in time to the music, while pretending they are enjoying it.For some reason, I just find it incredibly socially awkward. It does not show a spontaneous appreciation of anything, it doesn’t allow you to feel like you are joining in with the performance in any way. It merely makes me want to chew off my own elbow and sink down into my tippy-up seat until it is all over.Yet even I, as a confirmed clapping hater, find Manchester University union’s recent decision to discourage the practice strange.The student union last week voted to replace clapping at any official events with the British Sign Language equivalent – which is essentially “jazz hands” – or what some people seem to be calling “spirit fingers”. Meanwhile, all other student societies and organisations will be encouraged to do the same.The idea, the head of the student union said, was to “avoid triggering anxiety and improve accessibility” for students who may have autism, sensory issues or deafness.There is, of course, a long history to showing appreciation after a performance or debate and the fact that the practice is used in some form, worldwide, suggests that it is an inate reaction. Some cultures use clapping to demonstrate their enjoyment of or agreement with something, while others stamp feet, shout, whistle or wave things.: Jane Bradley: Children just aren’t bothered by P testsIn Roman times, it is said that Emperor Aurelian substituted the waving of napkins that he had distributed to the Roman people for the previously used technique of “toga flapping” to express appreciation, while Roman audience members were instructed when to chant their approval of a play – only after the chief actor called out “Valete et plaudite!”, which gave them permission to start shouting. The practice of politely patting our palms together is, to be honest, a very British way of doing things. It is controlled, fairly quiet in the big scheme of things and doesn’t require us to let go, emotionally speaking.Yet other people have also tried to do what they could to limit clapping. Richard Wagner famously stopped writing breaks into his operas, instead allowing the music to flow between movements, because he so detested hearing a round of applause after a section of music came to an end.Golf tournaments have their own special form of clapping known as a “golf clap” in a bid to not to disturb other golfers, who may be in the process of attempting a shot.Meanwhile, Manchester University student union’s idea has been mooted among student groups for some years now. In , a women’s event run by the National Union of Students asked delegates to use jazz hands instead of clapping as some people there had said it was causing them concern. Subsequently, the general secretary of the London School of Economics Students’ Union revealed that the practice was used throughout the National Union of Students in place of clapping as a way to “show appreciation of someone’s point without interrupting or causing disturbance”.: Jane Bradley: I’ve had it up to here with memesThere are some concrete examples of situations where people have been adversely affected by clapping. One, which I read on Twitter, was the story of an autistic young man who had been hospitalised by a panic attack because his friends had cheered, clapped and whooped when he was taking part in a race. Obviously, this must have been very distressing for him – and his friends and family.Yet, there are plenty of things which distress dferent people for dferent reasons, and we can’t avoid all of them.I have a friend who hates coming near my house because quite a few of my neighbours have cats . She can have a full-blown panic attackshe comes too close to a moggie in the street and worries for days about how she can get out of a social invitationshe discovers that her host has a previously undeclared pet puss. It sounds funny, but it’s not a laughing matter for her. It causes huge anxiety. Yet she accepts that she cannot stop the population of the world from owning pet cats.I have a couple of other friends who suffer from coeliac disease, which means they can’t eat gluten – with dire, potentially long-term consequencesthey do so. They spend their days checking and re-checking packaging, worrying aboutrestaurants which claim to be gluten-free actually operate a gluten-free area of their kitchens. It is stressful. Yet nobody has suggested that we should remove gluten entirely from society.It is sad – and dficult – for iniduals who have a condition or mental health issue that involves an ordinary activity.Yet, evenwe replace clapping with jazz hands the world over, there are still likely to be situations where sudden loud noises occur. Roadworks while walking down the street a car engine backfiring. We cannot eradicate all anxiety or health triggers, no matter how kind it would be to try to do so.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810832.1538764421!/image/image.jpg","title":"stephen jardine is the michelin guide biased against scottish food","story":"Despite the array of fine dining on offer, Scotland now has only eight restaurants with one star, writes Stephen Jardine.Nicola Sturgeon last month launched a new tourism strategy to help grow the Scottish economy by£ billion. The industry-led Food Tourism Scotland Action Plan aims to boost the sector through a range of measures to connect visitors with food. “Scotland is already renowned as the land of food and drink with our quality produce known throughout the world,” said the First Minister. With visitors already spending £bn a year on our food and drink, they clearly love what we offer. If only the restaurant industry bible felt the same. This week the Michelin Guide for  was unveiled and it didn’t take long for Scottish chefs to digest the contents. No new stars for Scotland this year. In fact, thanks to three deletions from the list, Scotland now has just eight restaurants with one star, the lowest total in years, and one with two.In contrast, a record  new stars were awarded in England and Ireland. With restaurants like Cail Bruaich and The Gannet delighting critics and customers in Glasgow, the absence of any Michelin stars in our biggest city remains a profound mystery but is a wider myopia at work  Does Michelin have a blind spot for Scotland  :  Scottish restaurants that deserve a Michelin starOne chef who was hopeful this week is convinced that is the case. “It is almost as though Scotland does not exist. It is staggering,” they told me. On paper it does look odd. Inver, Castle Terrace, Aizle, The Three Chimneys, The Torridon and Isle of Eriska all had good reasons to be optimistic. With great young chefs cooking at the top of their game and wowing reviewers, they appear to tick all the boxes. Except when it comes to the mysterious formula required by Michelin.Even chefs who did make it queued up to question the decisions made this year calling them “frustrating” and “very disappointing”. So what is the problem  Could it be a deep-rooted prejudice dating back to the bad old days when fine dining in Scotland was more tatties than tasting menus  Or are the exciting developments in restaurants here just going unnoticed : Stephen Jardine: Why we should thank Jamie Oliver for not shutting upTwo leading restaurant owners traditionally on the Michelin radar told me they are convinced they weren’t even inspected this year. Although inspectors book anonymously and pay their own bills, some then reveal their presence after eating. Others don’t but spotting them in remote rural parts of Scotland isn’t exactly rocket science. Despite the criticism this year, Michelin insist Scotland isn’t getting a raw deal. “There hasn’t been a change in the inspection process. We make an announced visit about every  months, and we certainly don’t have a blind spot when it comes to Scotland. There are some excellent restaurants there, and the team covers theand breadth of Scotland to make sure we are absolutely confident in our selection,” said Rebecca Burr, director of the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland.But a lot can happen in  months. Restaurants have launched, been savaged by TripAdvisor and closed far faster than that. If a week is a long time in politics,  months is an eternity in the world of food.

This is yet another reason why we need a moratorium on this industry. Existing businesses need to clean up their act before any new farms are developed, otherwise we risk trashing Scotland’s reputation for good food and a clean environment.“Sepa’s new regulations must deliver a sea change in the way the industry operates.

In  there was a slight drop in the industry’s compliance rate though we understand from SEPA that the issues have not led to any environmental deterioration.“The industry works closely with Sepa to ensure it meets required standards, and addresses issues promptly where there is room for improvement.  Indeed this is central to the way compliance is assessed, with farms required to demonstrate action to remedy non-compliance.  The industry is committed to raising standards higher.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves.

Islands proofing – ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation – must work.#There are too many cases right now where that is not happening, such as the government imposing car parking charges on leline airports where there is no public transport alternative.#For the Islands Act to be worth the parchment it’s written on, these things must change.#Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: #The Scottish Islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this Act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures.#They have very distinctive needs so the Act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future.“On a more visual front, it ensures Shetland will no longer be ‘boxed off’ on maps which has been a cause of irritation to those living in Shetland.#When producing a map of Scotland, the Shetland Islands must therefore be displayed in a way that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland.“It introduces a new duty on Scottish ministers and the wider public sector to have regard to island communities when exercising their s and preparing policy, strategies, services and legislation – known as “island-proofing”.“And the National Islands Plan will also be produced which, amongst other things, gives us a strategic direction to improve outcomes for our islands by creating the right environment for investment, empowerment and increasing sustainable economic growth.” raquoI#m glad to hear that Shetlandcan#t be put into a box on maps. It#s a start to getting the northern isles properly represented in their correct position on an atlas.On a similar line, in a number of the paper atlases of UK that I have, the northernisles are represented at a completely dferent scale. In an old OS map book, the southis shown at mile to the inch whilst the Northern isles are shown at about  miles to the inch. Similarly, a road atlas produced by RAC has The South shown at  miles to the inch whilst the northern isles can only get about . miles to the inch.So, the next step should be to get the northern islands correctly represented in scale as well as position.Saw a duvet set for sale in Debenhams in Inverness. you should see where they have put Shetland on their map.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.

The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.   Minister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd “You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”Of the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali. A specialist company is working to clear these but, because of the amount of damage, this is taking some time. However, our contractor is working as quickly as possible and we hope to have all the debris cleared in the near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"barrister taking legal action over electoral commissions decision not to investigate dup brexit donation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Good to meet and listen to @moneillsf, @StephenFarryMLA, @columeastwood, and Steven Agnew @GreenPartyNI together to discuss the ongoing #Brexit negotiations and the importance of a legally operative backstop for Northern Ireland. pic WLDWMlEXYp— Michel BarnierOctober , Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said the meeting signied a clear show of unity against Brexit by the pro-remain Assembly parties.Ms O’Neill said: “The parties stood together in the heart of the EU to make it absolutely clear that the DUP and British Government do not represent the cross-community majority of people of the North who voted against Brexit, and who do not want us to be excluded from the customs union or single market which only serves to increase business costs, and hamper trade, jobs and economic opportunity.She added: “We asserted our common position that the ‘backstop’ as already agreed must be maintained and is the absolute bottom line for Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party.”The EU and UK have expressed hope a deal can be reached to avoid a hard Brexit.Time is running out to secure an agreement and raty it before the UK leaves in March.Senior Democratic Unionist, Sammy Wilson, one of the DUP’s  MPs at Westminster who are holding up the minority Government, went on Twitter.He said: “If she is rolling back on her pledge that there will be no barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, then the Prime Minister should be under no illusions we will vote against her deal and it will go nowhere.”The EU and UK are at odds over the Irish border and the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan is under attack from Brexiteers in her own party.An EU leaders’ summit is due in Brussels on October  anda deal is close a special Brexit meeting could be called in November to sign off on it."},{"url":null,"title":"999 call from belfast baby caragh walshs sobbing father is played","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning. Customer services staff were on hand to deal with any passenger queries and  indeed any passengers with feedback or complaints we would ask them to contact the airport directly so that we may resolve their issues.\"Dont forget to arrive at least  hours before your flight and that carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security.

It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant sheep skinned in northern ireland field legs chopped","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

They claim that councillors have done nothing to help them solve the smoke problem at their Carlisle Park home.The chanting outside the meeting went on for well over an hour. Inside, councillors decided against calling in the police as there were children involved. They closed the windows in the chamber and tried to speak over the noise from outside.DOWNPATRICK mdash Down councillors are staying firmly on course with their plans to open a major dumping site in a picturesque area less than half a mile from the Quoile River, outside Downpatrick.Despite facing a mounting wall of protest from planners and conservationists, councillors decided this week to stick to their guns and push ahead with the scheme.The site eats up almost  acres of land, about half a mile from Quoile Yacht Club, and the council scheme entails a six-feet excavation of the entire area.Pollution controllers at Stormont have already come out against the scheme because they fear it could pollute the nearby Quoile River and local planners have received many complaints from conservationists.Even councillors themselves are split and some launched into fierce opposition of the scheme at this weekrsquos council meeting.Downpatrick councillor George Flinn, whose home is less than a five-minute walk from the river, was the sternest critic and he pulled no punches in an open attack on the plan.ldquoI am appalled that a council which prides itself on being forward-looking should be asked to agree to the vandalising of one of the areas of outstanding natural beauty within its district.KILLYLEAGH mdash Residents of Killyleagh and Shrigley have called for a full debate on the future of the harbour site and possible marina plans.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

the Guildhall in Londonderry to mark the th anniversary of civil rights.Given that I was not born in , I have been examining the three Northern Ireland daily newspapers from October of that year.Dferent staring points are used for the start of the Troubles, such as the killing of John Patrick Scullion in June , or the civil rights march in Duke Street, Londonderry of October  , or the Burntollet Bridge incident of January , or the increase in killings and arrival of the British Army that summer.It was sobering therefore to begin my research with the October ,  editions of the Belfast , Irish News and News Letter.You get a view into a bustling and what must then have seemed very modern world.All three papersare beginning to resemble big  newspapers in a way that the grey papers of the s did not.There is local and international news, TV listings, features and large ads of fashionable clothes modelled by young women, as well as pages of property and classied and ads .There are two pages or more of sport at the back . Only months previously George Best’s European Cup success was probably the first time in the then  years of the News Letter that sport led the paper on the front .The papers of early October  are filled with exciting scientic developments such as the birth of sextuplets in England and progress towards a lunar landing .There are reports of disputes about sex education and stories on economic developments, and plenty about the Vietnam war and the looming US presidential electoral contest between Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey.And there is next to nothing on civil rights.Of the three papers, the Belfasthas an innocuous brief report about a coming march in Londonderry which is “awaiting acceptance of the proposed route,” which ends in a way that is, with hindsight, poignant, “but they don’t anticipate any objection”.Legacy Scandal: ‘The Army kept good records but terrorists didn’t, so historic probes are uneven,’ says Lord Dannatt Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The next day’s paper and the one after that, Wednesday and Thursday, are similarly low key, albeit with increasing references to the march .Then Duke Street erupts on to all three front pages on the Friday, the day before it took place and the day after William Craig banned it.The march and the fallout from it in Londonderry, Belfast, Dublin and London dominates all three papers until the end of month.By late October the turbulence in the Province is on the front page of the News Letter a little less oftenthan the others,and the main angle taken by the Irish News and News Letter on certain days is dferent . On some of the most dramatic days the Belfastruns ‘on the one hand, on the other’ editorials on its front page. But it is clear in all three titles that the situation is serious.Even so, through October  there is little hint that within a few years, in  , Northern Ireland would be on the brink of civil war.Most of the newspapers of late October  are still largely filled with the world of the Beatles and sport and politics and commerce and agriculture and entertainment and weather.Looking at the papers reminded me of the opening passages in a book The Great World War  to , which describes le in spring . It was a time of prosperity and exhibitions and emerging technology such as cars and phonesand movies. There is no sense of looming global catastrophe.Similarly today is a time of prosperityand new technology and lots of interest in celebrity and trivial things.I do not think we are on the verge of either a fresh outbreak of the Troubles or a global war. My sense is that there is so little stomach for conflict at this time of western affluence and comfort that there will be almost no capacity to fight it until it is imposed on us by a hungrier, leaner aggressive external power such as China.But while it is hard to foresee war, these are the strangest, most chaotic times politically in my le, stranger even than the Cold War, the end of which I remember. I wonderour prosperity and technology increases our expectations and magnies our fury over small deprivations and dferences.It is also a time of deep polarisation in Northern Ireland. If one thing has become clear in the last three years it is that the underlying isions between the two communities have barely healed at all.Also, Brexit is the manestation of, or perhaps the trigger of, a major realignment in Europe the final shape of which is unclear for the continent but will be huge for relations within the British Isles. The UK has shown only a limited willingness to stand up to the demands of the EU and Ireland.If a sudden agreement is reached to the satisfaction of Dublin but with a small constitutional loss for unionism, such as a partial regulatory Irish Sea border, will unionists react with rage  Or will it all be so complex that very few people even realise the scale of what has happened try catch     .               ..

Yet Sinn Féin want to deny any equality or any rights for unborn children in Ireland.”Sinn Fein has also faced criticism for what one of the leading organisers of the  march, Eamonn McCann, described as “their claim on the civil rights movement and the civil rights demands”. Mr McCann said: “I know that many people who were involved in the civil rights movement  years ago are deeply resentful of the fact that these people can come along, after all this time, and parade through the town as the inheritors of the civil rights tradition.”President Higgins, meanwhile, is to deliver the keynote speech at an event organised by the Civil Rights Commemoration Committee at Londonderry’s Guildhall.He is expected to argue that the civil rights movement’s emphasis on non-violence and collective action was an example then, and can be an example today.The Irish president is also expected to place the events in Londonderry  years ago within the context of other campaigns in the late s around the world.Throughout the weekend there will be talks from figures such as Baroness Nuala O’Loan, Lord Alf Dubs, and Michael Mansfield.\"  \"  Fty years ago there was little sense of Northern Ireland being on the brink Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Then I made an eagle on number  after I topped it off the tee.\"I stuck my second to about  feet and holed the putt. The American Golf event makes you feel like a professional golfer because Sky Sports film you for T.V. Itrsquos pretty cool.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is unacceptable and must be urgently addressed.“We are calling for clear and fair remuneration and reimbursement so that investment can take place to meet safety, quality and efficacy requirements.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/group_v2_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland building long term business partnerships","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Eugene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group, Bank of Irelands Gavin Kennedy, Bridgene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group alongside Eamon McCay, Frylite, and Brian Connolly, Pinnacle Bank of Ireland UK has been backing Northern Ireland businesses across the generations. Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
