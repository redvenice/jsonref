The 007 number has been taken up by a new agent – a woman – who embarks on a mission which forces Bond to come out of retirement.Despite Bond’s legendary reputation as a womaniser, the new 007 manages to resist his charms. A source said last night: ‘Phoebe is the hottest young writer in the UK and Hollywood at the moment. \u0027Everyone wants her. She’s a natural choice for Bond. She flew to New York and met Daniel and they immediately hit it off. He thinks she’s a genius.         Pheobe Waller-Bridge (pictured here in Fleabag) has been drafted in by Bond producers to write the latest film in the series. The 33-year-old already boasts a Bafta for her peformance in Fleabag and her adaption of Killing Eve helped make the thriller a huge hit in the UK and USA last year. ‘Her dialogue is sharp and brilliant. It’s young, it’s fun and it is all about female empowerment.‘This will be a very modern Bond for the MeToo era.’For Ms Waller-Bridge, the coveted position of Bond scriptwriter is the latest chapter in her dazzling career.The 33-year-old already boasts a Bafta for her performance in Fleabag, the second series of which recently finished to universal acclaim. Her adaptation of Killing Eve helped to make the thriller a huge hit both in Britain and the US last year.She has also had a part in the Star Wars series, as an android in Solo: A Star Wars Story.The latest Bond, Craig’s fifth and final outing as the spy, has been plagued by difficulties. Original director Danny Boyle dropped out, citing ‘creative differences’ when the script he worked on with long-time collaborator John Hodge was rejected.The source said: ‘Phoebe was brought in to save it and she has. Whatever ends up happening in the script you can be sure it’s going to be memorable.’Craig is determined his last outing as Bond will be ‘one for the ages’. Bond director Cary Fukunaga and the crew are due to begin filming in Jamaica within weeks. The movie is due to be released in April 2020.

Videograb: Oireachtas TVPA WireThe FAI has said it is taking urgent steps to address its governance and financial issues while the future of its former chief executive John Delaney remains in doubt.In a statement released on Sunday evening, the FAI board said it would meet again on Monday to review its response to the controversy that began with the revelation last month that Mr Delaney gave the association a €100,000 loan in 2017 to prevent it exceeding a €1.5 million bank overdraft. This loan was subsequently repaid.Mr Delaney has insisted he acted in the best interests of the game when he loaned the money to remedy a short-term cash flow problem.The association said it planned a root-and-branch review of its rules and processes. It also said it was engaging with Sport Ireland on the composition of a new governance committee with additional independent members.The statement added: “The association continues to work to restore the trust of its stakeholders including the Minister and Sport Ireland as soon as possible. The FAI wants to ensure that all those who play football across Ireland do not suffer as a result of the actions of the association.”The association also said it would respond to questions raised by the Oireachtas committee for sport by close of business on Monday.Mr Delaney, who took up the role of executive vice-president with the FAI last month after stepping down as chief executive, was not mentioned in the statement.Further pressure was placed on Mr Delaney by news reports about his expenses on Sunday.Minister for Sport Shane Ross said he had “ongoing concerns relating to corporate governance at the FAI and the circumstances surrounding a financial transaction”. Mr Ross said the need for transparency and good corporate governance was paramount and confirmed that “sports capital funding will only be granted to national governing bodies who are in good standing and who have strong corporate governance.” Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd, who chairs the Oireachtas committee on transport, tourism and sport said he was “deeply concerned” about reports in relation to Mr Delaney’s expenses.“I want to see a forensic audit of all of the accounting activities of the FAI and I believe the Minister and Sport Ireland should insist on that,” he said. John O’Regan, secretary of the Kerry District League told The , Mr Delaney had texted him on Saturday to say he would be stepping down from the FAI board, but would continue his role with Uefa. The FAI has declined to comment on this. The organisation has hired financial firm Grant Thornton to investigate how the loan came about, despite three members of the board knowing about the loan when it was paid.The controversial €100,000 payment, which has raised questions about the FAI’s governance arrangements, was not flagged to Sport Ireland, the State body that oversees the public funding of sporting organisations in the country.Sport Ireland has temporarily withheld further funding to the FAI pending an auditor’s investigation.ReviewOn Thursday, The Professional Footballers Association Ireland called for a complete overhaul of the organisation after reviewing the board’s behaviour in the Irish parliament.A statement from the Management Committee of the PFAI condemned the board as “rotten”.On Sunday, the Sunday Times reported on details of Mr Delaney’s spending on his work credit card in the last six months of 2016, while he was on a salary of €360,000 as chief executive. There are also reports that other FAI board members are also set to step aside from their posts over the coming weeks. Cathal Dervan, the FAI director of communications said there was no board meeting at headquarters at Abbotstown on Saturday. The ongoing controversy led to protests at a number of League of Ireland matches on Friday night. Well-placed sources said several members of the FAI board are now wavering in their support of Mr Delaney. There are, however, significant concerns that if Mr Delaney was to leave his post, Ireland’s influence at Uefa, the European governing body for soccer, could also be diminished at a time when the association is pursuing a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup alongside the English, Welsh and Scottish football associations. Mr Delaney is a member of Uefa’s executive until 2021, having been elected in 2017. The terms of his departure from the FAI would also have to be addressed.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday questions “need to be answered” by the FAI and Mr Delaney over the €100,000 loan.Speaking after a week in which Mr Delaney refused to answer questions at an Oireachtas committee about the loan citing legal advice, Mr Varadkar said: “I don’t think anyone would be satisfied by it”.“The public, taxpayers, football fans would have like those questions to be answered.”Mr Varadkar added Mr Delaney had been under no obligation to answer questions at the Oireachtas committee.“The truth is that he was within his legal rights not to answer those questions. He is not a public servant and therefore is not accountable to the Oireachtas,” he said.“However, the FAI is accountable to the Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement and is accountable to Sport Ireland for the money they get.”Elsewhere, sources said that they doubted sponsors would abandon the FAI immediately, despite several issuing statements on the controversy this week. One source close to a current FAI sponsor said it was likely brands would adopt a “wait and see” attitude, adding that it was “not the role of a sponsor to decide what the next part of the process should be”.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3860096.1555272426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"timetable of john delaney loan controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screengrab taken from Oireachtas TV of FAI executive vice-president John Delaney before the Joint Committee on Sport.

Judge Anthony Barr refused to grant an injunction. On Saturday night, Mr Delaney issued a statement describing the €100,000 payment as a short-term loan to aid the association because of a cash flow problem. The statement says the loan was paid back in full in June 2017. Sunday, March 24th: The Sunday Times publishes further details about John Delaney’s remuneration package. Along with earning €360,000 a year, the FAI paid his €3,000 monthly rent over a long period of time. The FAI announces that Mr Delaney’s new position will pay a lot less than his previous one.

Photograph: EPASTR The new head of Sudan’s military council said on Saturday a civilian government would be formed after consultations with the opposition and promised the transition period would last for a maximum of two years.Protesters, however, kept up the pressure for rapid change following the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat president Omar al-Bashir on Thursday.In his first televised address, Lieut Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Abdelrahman cancelled a night curfew and ordered the release of all prisoners jailed under emergency laws put in place by Mr Bashir before his downfall.During a meeting between the transitional military council and a coalition of opposition groups, including protest organisers, the protesters demanded that civilians be included in the council, opposition activists who were briefed about the meeting said.They will submit names of suggested members on Sunday.The military council also promised to “abolish all laws that restrict freedoms,” the activists said.The main group organiser, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), said in a statement that the council’s response was not satisfactory and called for protests to continue.The SPA said that among its key demands the restructuring of the country’s powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), the dissolution of militia forces that operated under Mr Bashir and the arrest of all “corrupt leaders” involved in what it called crimes against citizens.“There are clear demands and unless they are met, there is no escape but to publicise full rejection (of the council’s moves),” the SPA statement said, urging citizens to continue a sit-in outside the Defence Ministry.Thousands of people continued their sit-in outside the Defence Ministry in central Khartoum, a Reuters witness said.Mr Bashir was overthrown on Thursday after months of mass protests brought on by rising food costs, high unemployment and increasing repression during his three decades in power.But activists and opposition groups pressed ahead with demands that Mr Bashir’s close associates leave.On Friday, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, who was also Mr Bashir’s deputy, stepped down as head of the transitional military council after only a day in the post.On Saturday, state news agency and TV announced that the head of NISS, Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, better known as Salah Gosh, had also resigned.He was once the most powerful person in the country after Mr Bashir and protesters held him responsible for the killing of demonstrators demanding an end to military rule.Celebrations erupted on the streets of Khartoum overnight after Ibn Auf’s resignation. Thousands of protesters waved flags and illuminated mobile phones in the darkness and drivers hooted car horns. People chanted: “The second has fallen!” a reference to Ibn Auf and Bashir, witnesses said. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3860180.1555276145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"finland election social democrats leader declares victory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Finnish Social Democrat Party leader Antti Rinne prepares to vote at a polling station in Mantsala, Finland. Photograph: Markku OjalaEPA Finland’s leftist Social Democrat party leader Antti Rinne has declared victory in Sunday’s general election, after partial results showed his party winning by a tight margin with 17.8 per cent.The nationalist Finns Party was in second place with 17.6 per cent, after more than 97 per cent of votes were counted.“For the first time since 1999 we are the largest party in Finland. SDP is the prime minister party,” Mr Rinne said.The centre-right National Coalition of outgoing finance minister Petteri Orpo looks set to retain its seats with the Centre Party of outgoing prime minister Juha Sipila the big losers. Mr Rinne would be Finland’s first leftist prime minister in two decades.However, his ability to govern may be hampered by a surge in support for the nationalist Finns Party, riding a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment sweeping the Nordics.The Finns scored rapid gains since the start of the year when cases of sexual abuse of minors by foreign men emerged.Finns Party leader Jussi Halla-aho (47) cast his vote near his home in Eira, one of Helsinki’s most expensive neighbourhoods.“As you probably know we have doubled our support in opinion polls during the past six months,” he said. “We want to reduce to as low as possible the kind of immigration that is, in our opinion, damaging to the public finances of our country and to the safety and security of people.”Mr Rinne had earlier ruled out forming a government with the nationalists.With the European Parliament election less than two months away, the Finnish ballot is being watched in Brussels. A strong result for the Finns Party could bolster a nationalist bloc threatening to shake up EU policymaking.Anti-immigration parties have announced plans to join forces after the May 26th EU election.Just as the Social Democrats are benefiting from a growing sense of insecurity among Finland’s older and poorer voters, the Finns argue the nation has gone too far in addressing issues such as climate change and migration at its own expense.“We are going through a cultural shock in Finland. Part of the population is in a kind of state of shock amid all the change going on, and as a result they take the Finns Party’s hand,” said Karina Jutila, chief researcher at think tank e2.The success of the Social Democrats would mark a departure for Finland and the region, where leftist parties have struggled in recent years, yielding some of their hold on the working class vote as nationalist parties have emerged.In Sweden, prime minister Stefan Lofven has clung to power after his Social Democrats suffered their worst parliamentary election result in more than a century last autumn, enlisting the support of two liberal parties with a pledge to enact some right-wing policies.In Denmark, which holds an election in June, the Social Democrats are gaining ground, in part after espousing the populists’ anti-immigrant rhetoric.Mr Rinne favours work-related immigration to compensate for Finland’s ageing population, but also allowing in some refugees on humanitarian grounds, as the country has done thus far.The 56-year-old former union leader is also promising to raise taxes to fund welfare and combat economic inequality, which he says has risen under the centre-right coalition of prime minister Mr Sipila.Many of his supporters value Finland’s generous welfare state and are unlikely to be put off by plans to raise taxes.“I think the economy is very important right now and then the climate of course and then children’s issues,” said 33-year-old lawyer Elli Heino. “The environment. I can’t emphasise it enough,” business manager Lotta Makinen (30) said.Nineteen parties are running in the election, with eight of them holding seats in the parliament now, ranging from the environmentalist Green party, polling at 12.2 per cent, to the Feminist Party founded two years ago. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000194068109_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"petting zoos breeding grounds potentially lethal bugs","story":"A little girl holds a rabbit at a petting zooPetting zoos are becoming breeding grounds for potentially lethal bugs, tests have shown as parents are warned their children could be at risk from drug-resistant E. coli.A study of eight attractions found that more than one in ten animals were carrying strains of “highly virulent” bacteria against which standard antibiotics are useless.Petting zoos and show farms attract more than 12 million visitors a year in the UK and are hugely popular with parents and teachers as a means of educating young children.However, keepers were warned to improve hygiene on the sites in order to protect children in the face of the growing threat from antimicrobial-resistance (AMR).Decades of profligate use of...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

begum hiresgareth peirce human rights lawyer represented","story":"Gareth Peirce, who is now representing Shamima BegumShamima Begum’s family has hired one of the UK’s top human rights lawyers whose clients have included hate preacher Abu Qatada.Gareth Peirce, once described as the lawyer of choice “for every accused jihadist and IRA suspect” took over the former Bethnal Green school girl’s case last week, the  can reveal.It marks a significant development in the fight to bring the teenager back to Britain and will be deemed a timely coup for her family, coming as this newspaper revealed that Begum, according to sources, had served in the Islamic State’s “morality police” and had tried to recruit other young women to join the jihadist group.She was allowed to carry a Kalashnikov rifle and earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of Isil\u0027s laws, such as women\u0027s dress codes, sources claimed.Peirce, 79, of legal firm Birnberg Peirce, replaces Tasnime Akunjee, who had been working pro bono on the family\u0027s behalf since Begum fled to Syria in 2015.Mr Akunjee, whose attempt to meet Begum in Syria last month was blocked by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said the case was handed over because Peirce has the “legal aid contract to do the work” suggesting that the family has successfully applied for financial aid to appeal Sajid Javid\u0027s decision to strip Begum of her British citizenship.Shamima Begum in SyriaBegum\u0027s family is understood to have lodged a request for a judicial review to challenge the decision.  An appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission is said to require Begum\u0027s signature. It comes at a critical moment for the 19-year-old, whom it has also been claimed had stitched suicide bombers into explosive vests, intelligence operatives told Theresa May and Sajid Javid, according to The Mail on Sunday.However, there are concerns that such evidence may not meet the legal threshold for trial in Britain due to complications over whether it would be permissible in court.The allegations paint a very different picture of her time in Syria than that Begum herself has described.In interviews recently conducted from a refugee camp in northern Syria, she has insisted she lived as a housewife, doing little but care for her children, all three of whom have since died.“I just stayed at home and looked after my kids,” she said. “I didn\u0027t do anything dangerous. I never made propaganda, I never encouraged people to come to Syria. They don\u0027t have proof that I did anything dangerous.”Peirce, who was educated at Cheltenham Ladies College and Oxford University, made her name representing the Birmingham Six during the Northern Ireland Troubles and one of the Guildford Four from 1987.Abu Qatada, pictured in Jordan in 2014She has also represented Islamist cleric Abu Qatada, Moazzam Begg, the British terror suspect held at Guantanamo Bay and the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian mistaken for an Islamist terrorist and shot dead by police at Stockwell Tube station.Peirce is also currently representing Julian Assange in his battle against extradition to the US.In Qatada’s case, she was said to have pulled off a breathtaking coup against the Home Office in 2012 by filing an eleventh-hour appeal to Europe on behalf of her widely demonised client.The move wrong-footed the Theresa May, then Home Secretary, and delayed the extremist Muslim cleric’s deportation to Jordan, which eventually took place the following year.Peirce, who once turned down a CBE for services to justice, was played by Emma Thompson in film In the Name of the Father, based on the story of the Guildford Four, although she has reportedly never seen it.She did not respond to a request for comment about Begum.Comment: Only a proper Brexit can spare us from this toxic polarisationPhilip Hammond ridicules Brexiteer leadership candidates for forming \u0026#39suicide pacts\u0026#39 during last contestComment: Why I\u0026#39m standing for the Brexit PartyAssange tried to create a \u0026#39centre for spying\u0026#39 inside the Ecuadorian embassy, says nation\u0026#39s presidentRoyal wedding death threat revealed: Court hears chilling message warning day would be \u0026#39a blast\u0026#39New prison officer \u0026#39lucky to be alive\u0026#39 after having throat slit by inmate Painted cycle lanes are \u0026#39not sufficient to protect people\u0026#39 but instead cause motorists to pass closer, research findsSudan protesters demand army hands powers to civilian government US Muslim congresswoman says she won\u0026#39t be silenced by Donald Trump Gatwick drone was an inside job, carried out by someone who ‘had a link into what was going on at the airport’ says airport chief  Thawing Siberian permafrost soil risks rise of anthrax and prehistoric diseasesComment: The horrors of eating in bed eclipse even the trials of a loathsome house-guestRoyal superfans criticise Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s \u0026#39disappointing\u0026#39 decision to keep birth private as they vow to arrive in Windsor anywayItalian teenager accused of raping British girl on cruise in international waters walks free on legal technicality Ilhan Omar will not be \u0026#39silenced\u0026#39 after Trump attacks over 911 commentsIsil\u0026#39s leader in Philippines killed in gun fight, DNA test confirms GCHQ codebreakers crack the cryptic code of Frank SidebottomWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stratolaunch takes worlds largest plane with 117 metre wingspan","story":"The world\u0027s largest airplane - a behemoth boasting six engines, two fuselages and a wing broader than a football pitch - made its first test flight on Saturday in California.Taking to the skies over the Mojave Desert in California on Saturday, it was the first flight for the carbon-composite plane built by Stratolaunch Systems, started by late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, as the company enters the lucrative private space market.Designed to send humans into space at a fraction of the cost of rockets,  the white airplane called Roc took off shortly before 7 a.m. Pacific time (3pm UK time) and stayed in the air for more than two hours before landing safely back at the Mojave Air and Space Port, where a crowd of hundreds of people cheered.What a fantastic first flight, Stratolaunch Chief Executive Officer Jean Floyd said.Today’s flight furthers our mission to provide a flexible alternative to ground launched systems, Mr Floyd said.We are incredibly proud of the Stratolaunch team, today’s flight crew, our partners at Northrup Grumman’s Scaled Composites and the Mojave Air and Space Port.The plane is designed to drop rockets and other space vehicles weighing up to 500,000 pounds at an altitude of 35,000 feet and has been billed by the company as making satellite deployment as easy as booking an airline flight.Saturday\u0027s flight, which saw the plane reach a maximum speed of 189 miles per hour and altitudes of 17,000 feet, was meant to test its performance and handling qualities, according to Stratolaunch.Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, announced in 2011 that he had formed the privately funded Stratolaunch.The Stratolaunch aircraft has two fuselages and is powered by six Boeing 747 enginesThe company seeks to cash in on higher demand in coming years for vessels that can put satellites in orbit, competing in the United States with other space entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and United Launch Alliance - a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.Stratolaunch has said that it intends to launch its first rockets from the Roc in 2020 at the earliest. Allen died in October 2018 while suffering from non-Hodgkins\u0027 lymphoma, just months after the plane\u0027s development was unveiled.We all know Paul would have been proud to witness today’s historic achievement, said Jody Allen, Chair of Vulcan Inc and Trustee of the Paul G.

As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) in Life on MarsAshes to AshesThe 2006 time-travelling cop show, in which John Simm’s enlightened modern policeman woke (“woke” being the operative word) from a car accident in the thuggish policing era of 1973, spawned an accidental anti-hero in Philip Glenister’s swaggering bully-boy DCI Gene Hunt. He was a character so popular that he spawned a spin-off set in the early 1980s, Ashes to Ashes, in which Keeley Hawes was on the receiving end of his jocular chauvinism. Harvey (Bad Lieutenant) Keitel played Hunt in the US version of Life on Mars.220 19. Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia) in The BridgeRohde was the Danish partner (and polar opposite) of The Bridge’s Swedish cop Saga Noren, an empathetic foil to Noren’s Aspergers-ish detachment. Warm and very human he might have been, Rohde was also an unfaithful husband and morally flawed detective, finally shipped to her superiors after Noren suspected that he had poisoned (in prison) the killer of his 18-year-old son. He had.320 18. Gilles “Gilou” Escoffier (Thierry Godard) in Spiral His borderline policing methods and former drug habit always made Parisian lieutenant Gilles “Gilou” Escoffier a diamond in the rough, but he crossed the line by stealing gold ingots from a crime gang – enough for his long-term friend and partner Tintin Fromentin to quit the unit in disgust. The question for the upcoming new series is whether it’s also too much for boss and now lover Laure Berthaud?420 17. Jack Regan (John Thaw) in The Sweeney It’s hard to overestimate the impact in 1975 of this hard-hitting (literally) drama about the Flying Squad, shaking up the cosy world of TV police dramas, with “You’re nicked” and “Shut it!” replacing Dixon of Dock Green’s avuncular “Evening all”. Jack Regan might have been honest, but his tendency to punch first and ask questions later became a byword for 1970s-style policing. It’s hard to believe that Thaw grew up to be Inspector Morse.520 16. Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) in NYPD Blue Described by one critic as “a drunken, racist goon with a heart of gold”, the label homophobic could also be added to Franz’s character (first essayed in Hill Street Blues), although Sipowicz did make sporadic attempts to dry out and become more liberal in outlook. Invariably taking the “bad cop” role during police interrogations, it was always unwise to leave this bundle of anger in a comb-over and moustache alone with a suspect.620 15. John Wadsworth (Kevin Doyle) in Happy ValleySarah Lancashire may have been the star of the show, but Downton Abbey’s Kevin Doyle gave a quietly brilliant performance as cop-turned-murderer John Wadsworth in the second series of Sally Wainwright’s Yorkshire-set drama – 50 shades of horrified guilt and denial crossing his face as he investigated his own crime and witnessed an innocent suspect nearly go down for it. 720 14. DS Bill Otley (Tom Bell) in Prime SuspectWith his stare as adamantine as an Easter Island statue, and his mocking smirk, Otley was the intractable foe of Helen Mirren’s DCI Jane Tennison and the sexist ringmaster of the station’s sneering male clique. He wasn’t all bad, however, and when, in the last-ever episode, the alcoholic Tennison ran into Otley at an AA meeting, he tried to make amends and help her sober up.820 13. DS Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) in The FallStella Gibson may be dedicated to her job, but her strange fascination with Jamie Dornan’s Northern Irish serial killer Paul Spector always teasingly bordered on the psychosexual. And when it came to the actual sexual, Gibson wasn’t above bedding her police subordinates – although as Detective Sergeant Tom Anderson pointed out to her after a night between the sheets, he does bear a strong physical resemblance to Spector. Kinky.920 12. Gunvald Larsson (Mikael Persbrandt) in Beck The Stockholm police department’s human battering ram, Martin Beck’s right-hand man-mountain was never one to play by the rules. A former member of the merchant marine, Gunvald was a bully and a misogynist but fans came to love his short-circuiting of official procedure. That said, the character’s funeral after being shot dead was sparsely attended.1020 11. DCI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) in Endeavour It wasn’t looking good in the most recent series of the Inspector Morse prequel as Morse’s formerly avuncular mentor at Oxford City Police CID, Fred Thursday, seemed to be going the way of a forged 10-bob note. With a bent new boss, DCI Ronnie Box, Thursday was taking a more muscular approach to nicking suspects and pocketing envelopes stuffed with cash before seeing the light and returning to the side of the angels.1120 10. Eddy Caplan (Jean-Hugues Anglade) in BraquoThis relentlessly downbeat and violent Gallic take on The Shield (see below), created by ex-cop Olivier Marchal, followed a four-person squad of rules-disregarding officers we first meet gauging a suspect’s eyeball with a pen. It’s all increasingly brutal from there as Eddy Caplan and colleagues combat Parisian criminals with implacable force. What is the French for ‘an eye for an eye’?1220 9. William A Rawls (John Dorman) in The WireIf Dominic West\u0027s Jimmy McNulty is the nearest that the Baltimore police depicted in David Simon’s peerless drama have to a hero, then Rawls is the closest to a villain. A ruthless career cop whose rise and rise was facilitated by keeping inconvenient statistics – especially relating to murdered black men – off the books, he was also a bullying hypocrite, a married man cruising the city\u0027s dingier gay bars.1320 8. Frank Agnew (Mark Strong) in Low Winter Sun The downbeat Wire-wannabe Low Winter Sun started life on Channel 4 before being remade – Mark Strong included – by AMC and set in Detroit. Strong played homicide detective Frank Agnew who murders a corrupt fellow cop and stages it to look like a suicide after mistakenly thinking the victim had killed his girlfriend. As in the British original, Lennie James plays Agnew\u0027s co-conspirator Joe Geddes.1420 7. Dexter Morgan (Michael C Hall) in Dexter Not a policeman as such but the adopted son of a Miami cop who grew up to become a forensics specialist for a fictional Miami police department, Dexter had the perfect cover for his secret double life as a vigilante serial killer. And knowing what his fellow CSI officers would be looking for at a crime scene meant he was extra careful in his methods.1520 6. Chief Superintendent Lorraine Craddock (Pippa Haywood) in Bodyguard 1620 5. Chief Superintendent John Deakin (Tony Doyle) in Between the LinesLong before Line of Duty there was Between the Lines, the BBC\u0027s 1992 drama series starring Neil Pearson as a new recruit to the police\u0027s internal Complaints Information Bureau – a task hampered because his boss, John Deakin, a tough former RUC officer played with edgy menace by Tony Doyle, was more corrupt than most of the people he was investigating.1720 4. John Luther (Idris Elba) in LutherWhen we first meet John Luther he has chased a villain to the top of a staircase and has his foot on the miscreant\u0027s hand as he dangles several storeys up. Will he tread on his fingers and make him fall to his possible death? You bet. Idris Elba brings a brooding intensity to a policeman who will fall in love with the sociopathic murderer, Alice Morgan, he is investigating. They understand each other. Ahhh.1820 3. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) in The Shield Vic Mackey and his fellow Strike Team of corrupt LAPD officers used criminal means – including murder, torture and planting evidence – to take out the criminals in a TV show that made Dirty Harry look like Mary Poppins. Mackey started by shooting an innocent cop in the face in the show’s pilot episode, a taste of things to come, but he was made somehow sympathetic by an incredible performance from Michael Chiklis.1920 2. DI Fred Pyall (Derek Martin) in Law and Order Derek Martin, who went on to find soap fame as Charlie Slater in EastEnders, gave the performance of a lifetime as the blank-faced, hooded-eyed copper Fred Pyall, fitting up innocent suspects, putting the squeeze on snouts and nonchalantly taking back-handers from criminals. GF Newman\u0027s BBC drama was deemed so shocking in 1978 that it was locked away, never to see the light of day for another 30 years.2020 1. DI Matthew ‘Dot’ Cottan (Craig Parkinson) in Line of Duty Jed Mercurio’s BBC police drama is a positive barrel of bad apples – a rogue’s gallery where nobody, with the possible exceptions of detectives Kate Fleming and Steve Arnott – is above suspicion. Craig Parkinson gave a wonderfully slippery performance as DI Cottan, the AC-12 regular with a double life as a crime-syndicate insider known as the Caddy. Any redeeming features? He did die by throwing himself between an assassin’s bullets and Fleming at the end of series three.120 20. Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) in Life on MarsAshes to AshesThe 2006 time-travelling cop show, in which John Simm’s enlightened modern policeman woke (“woke” being the operative word) from a car accident in the thuggish policing era of 1973, spawned an accidental anti-hero in Philip Glenister’s swaggering bully-boy DCI Gene Hunt.

He did die by throwing himself between an assassin’s bullets and Fleming at the end of series three.Viewers are hoping to find out the identity of H in the current series, with many speculating it could be Superintendent Ted Hastings – the head of anti-corruption unit AC-12.The police drama, which first aired in 2012, has been commissioned for another series, but Mercurio admitted that he has not started writing it yet.“We are not going into straight into series six, we don’t shoot them back to back,” he said.Line of Duty series 5: Which police officer was identified at the end?The best TV shows of 2019 (so far)Jed Mercurio\u0027s zigzagging Line of Duty plot can leave you feeling dim“What we have always done, even though we’ve had two series commissioned, three and four, four and five, it’s helpful to the process that we are allowed time for the series to go out.“Then we can take stock of audience reaction and that’s really helpful to us, the stories have resonated.“Those help us plan ahead but we’re going to take stock after series five.”Additional reporting by agencies.Line of DutyThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ve adapted to change before. They must do so againClick to followThe IndependentIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics, the Tories must lead the way, both in tone and contentThe Parliamentary Conservative Party notoriously has two default settings: complacency or panic.The pressure of the Brexit process has moved the dial significantly towards the latter, although one should never underestimate the capacity of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership skills to encourage Conservatives into the former.For anyone who thinks long-term, though, the departure of colleagues with stinging remarks about destroying the Conservative Party should be worrying. Almost the worst thing about the early days of the Independent Group was that the Labour defectors were clearly distraught about leaving their political home, while the Tory defectors looked exultant.Is this the beginning of the end?I strongly believe that it need not be, and indeed will not be as long as the post-Brexit Conservative Party pours as much energy into its domestic policies and widening its base as it has into European affairs.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

In the late 1990s it looked as though Conservatives were destined for extinction in Scotland and Wales. The party now has significant representation in both countries, allowing it once again to become the truly national UK-wide party it has always been.Also over the last decade the party in parliament has begun to look much more like modern Britain in all its variety. It seems overwhelmingly likely that, just as the Conservatives were the first party to elect a woman leader, it will be the first party to elect one from a Bame background. Of course there is much more to do but the party has recognised the problem of looking and sounding too narrow and is taking effective steps to address it.Conservatives would be ‘wiped out’ in snap general election – Tory MPBefore I seem to sink back into the mode of complacency I should acknowledge that real problems exist. The membership of the party is not even representative of Conservative voters, let alone the wider country. It is much smaller than it used to be. It is possible to exaggerate how much older the Conservative Party membership is than Labour’s, but it is still true that some 44 per cent of Conservative members are over 65, compared with 30 per cent for other parties.There is also a whiff of intolerance in the air inside the party which is new and dangerous. Deselection is a word which in the past has only been associated with the unpleasant actions of the hard left of the Labour Party. If it becomes a habitual threat from the hard right of the Tory party it will signify a move away from being a party of government. It should be stamped out immediately.But to address any of these long-term issues requires progress on Brexit, and then a move on to other matters. We all know that the Brexit vote represented a myriad of discontents, some of them shared across the west since 2008, and some specific to this country. What the Conservative Party needs to do is address the various sources of discontent.Ashdown and Lord Kinnock (PA)This is more difficult than previously. In 2005, after our third election defeat in a row, I gave the Macmillan Lecture for the Tory Reform Group and observed that: “If the Conservative Party does not like modern Britain it is unlikely that modern Britain will warm to the Conservative Party.”Much of that problem was solved by David Cameron and his modernisation programme. The current leadership faces the even more intractable problem that modern Britain no longer seems to like itself. The tone of political discourse ranges from the harsh to the disgraceful. Violent language is common. Disgracefully, and occasionally tragically, this spills over into physical violence.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics the Conservative Party in its post-Brexit phase needs to lead the way, both in tone and content. The tone required is one of respect not just for each other and our varying views but for our political opponents as well. This is not easy.The current Labour Party is determined to establish a false and unpleasant narrative: that the (necessary) period of austerity after 2008 means that every inidual Conservative politician is complicit in creating poverty and misery and is therefore beyond the pale. It is very tempting to respond in kind, but this temptation should be resisted.Raising the debate from the gutter is the right thing to do and will in the long run benefit those who do it, as long as the underlying discontents are addressed at the same time.Long ago\u0026nbspRab\u0026nbspButler said he was keen to make it ‘perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory’. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a ToryInevitably, after the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent global recession, there are no lack of problems requiring a hard-headed but warm-hearted solution, in the best tradition of One-Nation Conservativism. As we move out of the austerity period we have the chance to provide a mixture of targeted increases in public spending and tax cuts which will provide future prosperity both for the country and the party.That chance will only come if there is a successful Brexit settlement which releases the large amount of stalled investment that has been waiting for certainty but if and when this happens, the opportunities are huge.In politics and economics maths is everything. If your economy grows at 2.5 per cent a year, you can afford to increase public spending, cut taxes, and have some left over to reduce long-term debt. If it grows at 1.5 per cent a year, which would probably be our fate if Brexit goes wrong, you don’t have enough flexibility.Although sorting Brexit is therefore the first and overwhelming priority, the choices the party makes about where it concentrates next are key.This is not the place for detailed policy blueprints, but the areas for activity are pretty clear. We need to meet the needs of those parts of the country which did not benefit from the finance-driven globalisation of the 1990s. The Northern Powerhouse was a good idea and needs to be made a reality. Coastal towns, and more generally medium-sized towns with no nearby big city, have special needs.Created with Sketch.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downAway from the geographical concentrations of disadvantage which the government should address, the national challenges are equally clear.The first tentative steps towards a revival of home ownership have been taken, but this ought to be much higher in the political mix. The unfairly neglected Industrial Strategy needs to be at the heart of what the government both does and talks about between now and 2022. If we get right our policy towards artificial intelligence, 5G, electric vehicles, and other new technology, then the effects of Brexit will be relatively small. The same is of course true on the downside.If it is to meet present\u0026nbspchallenges, the party will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevanceThis is not to neglect the traditional areas of policy dispute. Just as health now has a growing budget and a proper long-term plan, I would like to see education treated in the same way. By education I don’t just mean school and universities, but also the FE and apprenticeship sectors, which deserve more attention than ever before.In social policy, I think grasping the nettle on social care funding should be the start of a much deeper process of rethinking our attitude to the over-60s to recognise the fact that people commonly live to be 90 or older and are fitter and healthier than ever before into their 70s. We should stop assuming that everyone over the age of 65 is frail and just wants a quiet life. Staying in the world of work is not just better for the economy, it is usually better for the inidual.There is no shortage of challenges, and happily no shortage of thinking about them. Both my colleagues in parliament, and centre-right thinktanks new and old, are fertile in creating policy ideas. For the country’s sake, these ideas need a successful political party to make them real. Far from being defunct, the Conservative Party is needed as much as ever to shape Britain in the post-Brexit world.Tory Party being ‘hollowed out’ by ex-Ukip members, John Major sayIf it is to meet this challenge, it will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevance. It also needs to regain the mantle of the party that offers opportunity to all.Millennials have been foisted with an unfair reputation as entitled snowflakes. They are having to cope with a fast-changing world of work which offers less security than their parents enjoyed, and a significantly more difficult route to settled prosperity in their own home. Most of them want that, and the political prize for offering it is huge.These substantive policy areas will be much more likely to win first-time voters than any improvement to campaigning techniques on social media, necessary though they are.At the same time, leading Conservatives need to take every chance to show that being a Conservative does not in some way mark you out from the rest of the country. Corbyn’s Labour Party is determined to pursue this idea, and it needs refuting. Long ago Rab Butler said he was keen to make it “perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory”. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a Tory.These various policy suggestions involve recasting some traditional Conservative values, including opportunity for all, home ownership and support for business, to make them fit for the mid-21st century.This will allow the party to follow one of the wise points made by another Tory guru, Keith Joseph, in the 1970s, when he said that instead of the centre ground, politicians should seek the common ground. It is a subtle but important difference, in that it means that instead of triangulating between the existing extremes, you identify new areas of concern which the people may have reached before the politicians.The Brexit vote showed that there was indeed a disconnect between political conventional wisdom and the desires of the British people. Throughout its history the Conservative Party has been sensitive to such changes, and adept at adapting to them.It needs to do so again.Damian Green has been the Conservative MP for Ashford since 1997 and was the first secretary of state and minister for the Cabinet Office from June to December 2017Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Three for three boosters today on Falcon Heavy, what an amazing accomplishment.The Falcon Heavy soared from the space centre using the same pad that shot Apollo astronauts to the moon half a century ago and later space shuttle crews.Space is doing strange things to astronauts\u0027 bodies, Nasa study showsNearby beaches and other prime viewing spots were packed with tourists and locals eager to catch not just the launch but the rare and dramatic return of twin boosters, accompanied by sonic booms.The roads were also jammed for Wednesday night\u0027s launch attempt, which was scuttled by high wind.Because this was an upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes, SpaceX chief Elon Musk cautioned in advance things could go wrong.But everything went well and the satellite ended up in the proper orbit.SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheered every launch milestone and especially the three touchdowns.The Falcons have landed, Mr Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters.From our iconic launch pads at NASAKennedy, we will continue to support the growing commercial space economy, NASA tweeted.The launch comes a year after Mr Musk put his own Tesla convertible on the initial test flight.The red Roadster - with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, likely still at the wheel - remains in a solar orbit stretching just past Mars.SpaceX plans to launch its next Falcon Heavy later this year on a mission for the US Air Force. The boosters for that flight may be recycled from this one.NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine last month suggested possibly using a Falcon Heavy - and another company\u0027s big rocket - to get the space agency\u0027s Orion capsule around the moon, minus a crew, in 2020.But the preferred method remains NASA\u0027s own Space Launch System mega rocket - if it can be ready by then.SpaceX typically launches Falcon 9 rockets. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of those single rockets strapped together.Until SpaceX came along, boosters were discarded in the ocean after satellite launches. The company is intent on driving down launch costs by recycling rocket parts.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the\u0026nbspelectric car industry\u0026nbspthat will bring the technology to the mass market.But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit.Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone.The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic.\u0026nbspMr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise.Created with Sketch.

As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not been easy.”Meanwhile,\u0026nbspWikileaks tweeted that Mr Assange’s cat,\u0026nbspMichi, was safe\u0026nbspafter its owner was forcibly removed from the embassy\u0026nbspon Thursday.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Great to smell fresh air says freed Assange Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cat was given to\u0026nbspAssange by his children four years into his seven-year stay at the embassy.It became a social media sensation after being pictured wearing a tie in the window of the consulate, and had appeared in photos with\u0026nbspAssange on\u0026nbspTwitter and Instagram accounts with the handle @EmbassyCat.Wikileaks tweeted a video of\u0026nbspMichi\u0026nbsplooking at a television showing footage of\u0026nbspAssange’s\u0026nbsparrest.The Wikileaks founder, 47,\u0026nbspfaces up to 12 months in jail in the UK for breaching his bail conditions.

But now we’re holding European elections, not knowing whether MEPs will take their seats or for how long. It’s extraordinary,” he said.“We cannot remain stuck in this loop for another six months.

I found out when I heard it on TV, like everyone else.“It’s scandalous that it came so late in the Brexit process, not at the 11th hour, not even at five to midnight, but at five past midnight after she missed her own deadline of\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspMarch.Tories face election drubbing as support ‘drops to six-year low’“Nevertheless, we’re engaging in the talks in a serious and constructive way. But we must see those red lines moving and we must see real compromise.”During his address\u0026nbspthe Labour leader also referred to the Westminster political system as “another world”, as he criticised the “alien language” and arcane procedure.“When the focus of our national conversation is dominated by baffling procedures in parliament and when nothing seems to change, I understands why people feel frustrated,” he said.“People watch the back and forth in parliament. They see the arcane procedure and hear the alien language. It’s another world.

It wasn’t to placate his own Eurosceptic MPs instead it was to stop Conservative voters defecting to pro-Brexit parties. That process seems to have restarted and the Conservatives are beginning to suffer.”A separate poll by Opinium put Labour seven points ahead of the Tories.Conservative support dropped six points in a fortnight to stand at 29 per cent – the party’s worst performance in the survey since 2014. The poll put Jeremy Corbyn’s party on 36 per cent, up one point from 29 March.\u0026nbspThe research echoed the findings of YouGov polling which this week found Tory support had slumped to\u0026nbspits lowest level in six years. The survey for The Times\u0026nbspput Theresa May’s party on 28 per cent in the event of a general election, down four points since the start of April, with only a two-thirds of Tory voters in the 2017 saying they would back them again.Labour were on 32 per cent, up one point. The Lib Dems were on 11 per cent, with Ukip in 6 per cent and the Brexit Party on 8 per cent.Mr Corbyn’s ability to form a government in the event of a hung parliament would be likely to depend on the support of the SNP, who could demand a second EU referendum as a bargaining chip.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said on Sunday it would be\u0026nbsp”unforgivable” for Labour to avoid a new public vote on Brexit.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyHe blamed a series of concerning polls regarding the party’s prospects at a general election on the delay to Brexit agreed at the EU emergency summit in Brussels.“It was on the 29th when we didn’t leave that’s when this has all gone wrong. Up until then people were prepared to give Theresa May the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “The big problem was as soon as we didn’t leave you could see all the poll ratings start to crash.”On participation in the European elections on 23 May – something the UK is legally bound to take part in if a Brexit deal is not agreed by the date of the election – Mr Duncan Smith added: “It would be a disaster for the country. What are you going to say on the doorstep? Vote for me and I’ll be gone in three months. It doesn’t make any sense.Corbyn under pressure to make bold referendum offerCorbyn says Brexit talks challenging with ‘collapsing government’Will there be a new Tory leader by the October Brexit deadline?Tories face elections drubbing as support ‘drops to six-year low’“I always campaign for Conservative candidates but I absolutely do not want to campaign on the Euro elections ticket which would be almost impossible to justify.”His remarks on Ms May’s leadership of the party came as two former chairmen of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs raised the possibility of a change in rules governing challenges to any leader.Under the current a system, a move against a Tory leader can only be brought once in a 12-month period. It means MPs in the party cannot attempt to topple Ms May again until December – a year on since she successfully saw off a bid by Brexiteers.May could remain PM until October Brexit deadline, Hammond hintsLord Spicer and Lord Hamilton wrote in The Sunday : “Conservative MPs are responsible for their party. If they wish to change these rules there is nothing standing in their way.”Chair\u0026nbspof the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady also told the newspaper: “It is my understanding that the rules could in future be changed by the agreement of the 1922 executive.”He added that it was “less certain that it would be possible to change the rules during the current period of grace which was initiated with the triggering of a confidence vote on 12 December\u0026nbsplast year”.Speaking on Friday, Mr Hammond said: “The prime minister has said that she will leave once she has done the deal and taken us out of the European Union.The chancellor said that as far as he was aware “she doesn’t have any intention of leaving until that deal is done”, adding: “So, she is a person with a strong sense of duty. She feels that she has got a duty, and an obligation to the British people to deliver Brexit and she will certainly want to make good on that obligation.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the occasions that they don’t, things can end brutally.\u0026nbspWhile an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties of being gay in Russia, these incidents are not an entirely new phenomenon —\u0026nbspor even the worst examples of homophobia.\u0026nbspChechnya\u0026nbspaside, the peak of anti-gay violence in Russia came about four years ago, when groups led by the nationalist\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbsp(aka “The Hatchet”) entrapped, beat and humiliated dozens of gay men on camera.\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspand his “Occupy\u0026nbspPedophilia” gang operated on the heels of the Kremlin’s 2013 infamous anti-gay law.But Martsinkevich\u0026nbspand his crew were always less concerned with money than with serving a warped ideology.\u0026nbspActivists say the vast majority of the more recent attacks have been economic in their aims.When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, the state does everything to avoid prosecutionThat does not mean there have not been victims of violence. On several occasions, young men have been found in pools of blood following apparent robbery attempts, and without obvious signs of forced entry.\u0026nbspBut today’s gangs do tend to be less violent, and instead use the taboo of homosexuality in society to keep the crimes as hidden as possible.\u0026nbspIt’s an effective enough strategy, says Igor\u0026nbspKochetkov, the head of the Russian\u0026nbspLGBT\u0026nbspNetwork, a prominent advocacy group.\u0026nbsp“People are reluctant to go to the police because they don’t want to reveal their orientation,” he says. “And the regular homophobic statements from officials don’t exactly encourage them.”\u0026nbspRussia reinstates yoga into prisons following claims it turned inmatesThe Russian court system is not set up to help them, the activist says. When the odd case does reach court, it is usually processed as hooliganism or robbery the hate element is never included as an aggravating factor. When\u0026nbspMartsinkevich\u0026nbspwas finally arrested and jailed in late 2014, for example, it was for a racist video. No mention was made of the anti-gay aspects of his extremism.\u0026nbsp“When it’s clear homophobic crimes are at play, such as what happened in\u0026nbspChechnya, the state does everything to avoid prosecution,”\u0026nbspsays Kochetkov.\u0026nbspAccording to Andrei Petrov, programme director of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ advocacy group Stimulus,\u0026nbspa lack of successful prosecutions is allowing the problem of date extortion to become more widespread.\u0026nbspIn a survey conducted by his organisation in 2018, one in five members of the\u0026nbspLGBT+ community reported that they had been victims of such hate crimes. Only a similar percentage report the crimes to police, and even fewer are properly investigated.\u0026nbspGiven the lack of progress in Russian courts, Stimulus has decided to try their luck with the European Court of Human Rights.\u0026nbspTwo killed and 40 held in new Chechen gay ‘purge’, activists sayTheir test case, which dates from 2017, follows the familiar pattern. The victim,\u0026nbspYevgeny, 39, surname withheld, answered a profile on a love.mail.ru, a well-known dating site. He sent his picture the other party sent his, and the pair agreed to meet by a block of flats in Moscow’s suburbs. Again, there were warning signs. The date said his name was\u0026nbspDima\u0026nbspin messages, but introduced himself as\u0026nbspDanila. But regardless,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspagreed to go upstairs to the\u0026nbspflat.There, a gang of eight men were waiting. They made sure\u0026nbspYevgeny’s\u0026nbspquick date instead ended in a heavy beating, a request for money, and a threat to call the police for “paedophilia”.\u0026nbspEventually,\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspplucked up the courage to report the crime to the police. But since then, two years have passed without progress, with investigators refusing to open a criminal investigation.\u0026nbsp“I believe the police were covering them up,”\u0026nbspYevgeny\u0026nbspsays. “I’ve no doubt the guys think they are completely untouchable.”\u0026nbspActivists and victims allege the Russian government’s own “homophobia”\u0026nbsphas fuelled the extortion business.\u0026nbsp“The reason why these guys are getting away with it is because they are on the same side,” says\u0026nbspSergei. “One thing gives birth to another. They know they are doing the state’s work.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two! Half a Smartie. A minuscule fraction of the , a day a ten-year-old takes in.Banning buy-one-get-one-free deals on snacks and fizzy drinks would save eight calories a day. Moving “junk food” away from checkouts  Nine.These are negligible amounts, even added together.And they lay bare the arrogant folly of a Conservative Party which, in its panic over obesity and NHS resources, has surrendered to the middle-class public health zealots who spend their lives ­tut-tutting at working people’s grub.They imposed a tax on sugary drinks despite no firm evidence that it has cut obesity in any country which has tried it. It didn’t work there. It won’t here.Nor is there any basis to believe banning fast food ads on the Tube will reduce one single person’s weight. It’s a theory. A hunch. Feeble politicians deciding “something must be done”.Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies wants new taxes on chocolate and crisps. She must now be ignored. Tory nanny-statism has NO measurable ­benefits but does substantial harm.It saddles everyone with higher shopping bills. It damages food businesses. It earns the Government a reputation for obsessive interference in our lives which should never be a Tory trait.Few except Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss seem to grasp it.

To say that leaving the EU, which they used to claim had negligible impact on our sovereignty, is in fact too hard. That it’s “undeliverable”.Remainer politicians told .million Leavers a pack of lies about honouring their vote. Now, as they hoped, Brexit is “delayed” again. And the EU, with whom some openly colluded, are gloating about it maybe being reversed.You think our nation is humiliated now  Wait until MPs revoke Article .The Tories are carrying the can, and fair enough. But at least most have tried to deliver what the majority wanted.Corbyn’s MPs duped Leavers, then opposed every step towards Brexit, in a disgusting assault on our democracy.Let’s hope democracy bites them back.DO not forget the blinkered delusions of the Tory ERG in this betrayal.They convinced themselves Brexit was inevitable. The law was on their side. Remainer tricks could not stop them. They fatally rejected the one viable deal, thinking a harder one was days away.It was all cobblers. They missed what everyone outside their bubble could see: they were outnumbered by Remainers who will scrap Brexitthey can.Yet the ERG still won’t back Theresa May’s deal. They are still in denial.Yes, their Brexit might be possible under a charismatic new Tory leader with a thumping Commons majority.Anyone see that happening THEY backed the Kremlin over the Salisbury poisonings. Now Labour backs the fantasist, coward and fugitive Julian Assange.See the pattern  It’s not just that Corbyn’s rabble are reliably on the wrong side of history.

But there are risks to this approach.Labour coming out for a second referendum would cost them in their Leave-voting seats and in the places they must win to form a government.Of the  seats in England and Wales that Corbyn needs to get a majority,  voted Leave. While  of his  most vulnerable seats backed Brexit.Corbyn’s other option is to do a deal with Mrs May.If he pushed her into accepting a customs union, then he would further ide the Tories.A deal would also mean Britain was out and that Corbyn could fight the next election on the domestic issues he cares about most.As one Cabinet Minister puts it: “There is an appeal for Corbyn to support something. He can create fissures within the Tory party, look serious, andhe becomes PM he doesn’t have to deal with all this crap.” But there are big risks to this approach, too.If Corbyn helped a Brexit deal over the line, there would almost certainly be more defections from the Labour Party.It would also produce a rallying cry for Chuka and Co.They would be able to tell pro-Remain votersthat Labour had betrayed them, that it could have stopped Brexit but chose not to.This is a finely balanced decision for Corbyn. But he doesn’t have long to make up his mind. If the Tories take a pasting in either next month’s local elections or the European elections, then Mrs May could be gone as Tory leader — replaced by a Brexiteer.This new Tory leader would immediately break off talks with Corbyn.If he wants to do a deal, he needs to DO IT SOON. Which way will he go Well, one of those involved tells me that the situation in the talks is “less negative than people think”. But the likelihood of these talks producing something remains low. What would make a deal attractive to Jeremy Corbyn would make it unpalatable to Theresa May.Another complication is that, as one Cabinet Minister points out, “It’s quite finely balanced that a May Corbyn deal could get through” the Commons as Labour MPs passionately in favour of a second referendum would vote against it, as would Tories who viscerally oppose a customs union.The depressing truth is that there is now a growing risk that the Tory party doesn’t deliver Brexit AND doesn’t stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting to Number . This would be an epic failure.Unless the Tory hold-outs decide to back the existing deal when they come back from their holidays, this danger will become increasingly real.CONSERVATIVE MPs are taking a second look at Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary has more critics on the Tory benches than any other leadership contender.But the party’s precipitous fall in the polls is making Tories reconsider.If they are losing a quarter of their support to pro-Brexit parties, who is better placed to win those voters back than the man who led the Leave campaign  Boris’s campaign is more organised than it was.The arrival of the former MP James Wharton has helped and, as one of those on the team puts it, MPs are now “petried about their seats” and so more prepared to swallow their doubts about Boris.A decade ago, one of those who knows the Tory party best told me that the Tories would only turn to Boris when they were - down with  minutes to go.They now are three down and that means Boris is back in contention for the premiership.MRS MAY might still be in the post. But make no mistake, the Tory leadership contest is under way.We have now even got ministers saying on live TV who they will back when there’s a contest.This week, the Treasury Minister Mel Stride got  or so Tory MPs who want Michael Gove to run for leader together with their potential candidate for drinks.One of those present tells me it is increasingly likely that Gove will run.THE big decision on whether to press ahead with HS has to be taken in December.But with a change of Tory leader likely to happen before then, the project is in trouble.Scrapping the scheme would give any new PM billions to spend on other projects, such as better transport within and between northern cities and proper, digital infrastructure for the whole of the UK.There’ll be no shortage of candidates making this case come a Tory leadership contest.THE six-month Brexit extension is the wrong .It is neither short enough to force MPs to make up their minds about what they want, nor is it long enough to allow for a new Prime Minister and a general election campaign.Emmanuel Macron wanted to give Britain a short extension to force a decision, Angela Merkel favoured one long enough to give the UK time to come up with a new path. In the end, they compromised on this medium- extension.“Two potential routes out and they went to the middle one that delivers us to nowhere,” laments one Cabinet Minister.There is a real danger that the Brexit drt continues for another six months. This useless Parliament knows what it doesn’t want, but can’t say what it would actually accept.If this happens, Britain will end up back at the EU Council in October asking for a THIRD EXTENSION.This would be ridiculous. But one Secretary of State predicts that this is “where we’ll probably end up and at that point Macron’s view will probably prevail”.The French President might be so full of himself that you think he’s going to burst.But he’s right that only a HARD DEADLINE will force our MPs to make up their minds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why stand in them If they are still serious that we are leaving the EU, why waste money fielding candidates as Tory MEPs Leavers will vote for Nigel Farage’s new outfit now anyway.THE sacking of housing expert Roger Scruton exposes a Tory Party and political system derailed by one website: Twitter.Scruton’s blunt remarks on Islamophobia, Hungary and the Chinese were quoted out of context by a left-wing journo who cynically stitched him up, then gloatingly toasted his downfall.But today’s Tories lack the spine to face down a leftie Twitter mob.So they indulge in virtue-signalling or desperate damage-limitation.Two hastily demanded Scruton be fired. One, without irony, said it was a “no-brainer”.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire brainlessly obliged. Their mistake became obvious too late.Politicians forever come a cropper with knee-jerk tweets.Like Tory chairman Brandon Lewis demanding Boris Johnson apologise for burka remarks most of Britain then backed.MPs are hooked on it and presumably imagine Britain is too.But political Twitter is a bubble, not the national conversation.A visit to any town or city outside the M would tell them that.And the Tories and Labour might then begin to grasp the white-hot rage felt by millions over the abysmal state of our politics and MPs’ infantile tribal games.WE hope the Tory ERG have a long, hard and sober think over their Easter break.They may want to be remembered as heroic holdouts against a softish Brexit.Butthe decision of .million ­people is overturned, and the Tories are ousted by hard-left extremists who inflict poverty on Britain, it will not be the Remainer MPs history recalls.Fair or not, it will be two dozen ERG members who had the sole viable Brexit deal in their grasp and threw it away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, it’s quite the opposite.For a start, not one recipient seems grateful.But more importantly, we are almost skint ourselves, so not exactly in a position to be flash with our cash.Are you aware that we have to pay £BILLION A YEAR simply in interest, servicing our own debt.So that is before we pay off any of the actual debt.So spending £billion a year on an ill-thought-through and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target seems nonsensical to me.A couple of recent examples of the kind of thing that some foreign aid is spent on once it has been allocated include fixing potholes in Pakistan and India and helping an all-female pop group dubbed the Ethiopian Spice Girls.But another story this week shines even more light on how misguided our foreign aid spending is.Auditors investigating the way £.billion was spent through charities found poor management practices and delays by the Department for International Development, which was described as “dithering”, risked completely wasting the money.The net result is that these foreign aid projects — which spend ten per cent of our aid budget — are “unlikely to achieve lasting change”.So not only are we throwing money we can not afford at a problem that is not ours, that money may as well be flushed away for all the good it is doing.How galling is that  Just to reiterate, we are talking about a whopping £.billion here — not just a few thousand quid.This is enough money to change lives here profoundly and on a very grand scale.But that brings me back to my first point: Why on earth are we giving away such a colossal amount of money when we really are not in a position to do so And it was recently revealed that more than million people in the UK are living in poverty.By the way, that figure includes .million children who are living below the breadline — and suffering badly as a result.More than half of them will not be able to get themselves out of poverty and will find themselves trapped in a cycle that goes on for years, according to a new measure for tracking poverty that has brought together specialists from across the political spectrum.The scary thing is that even a relatively comfortable income is no guarantee that people can meet basic material needs —that income is eaten up by unavoidable weekly outgoings.And this problem is getting worse, not better. By - the proportion of children living in relative povertyis on course to hit  per cent — exceeding the previous record high of  per cent in the early s.This could mean an extra one million children living in poverty in the next five years.In other words, we have a serious problem on our hands.Many people will no doubt blame austerity for the increase in poverty over the past few years. And yes, sure, it is true that the cuts and freezes to welfare and disability benefits have had an impact.But just imagine the ways in which £.billion could begin to make a massive material impact on the lives of poverty-stricken people in this country.I believe that we should reserve some money — a couple of billion, say — for overseas catastrophes, such as tsunamis.But other than that, let’s stop giving away money that could be much, much better spent at home.I KNOW Jeremy Kyle has interviewed some dubious characters over the years, but the biscuit was well and truly taken this week by Georgina Clarke.This -year-old mother is so obsessed with cosmetic surgery that she allowed her daughter Kayla, aged , to dance for, and sleep with, a “sugar daddy” who then paid for both of them to have plastic surgery.Why does an -year-old “need” cosmetic surgery, you may ask.Kayla blamed the pressures of social media, as well as glamorous celebrities such as the Kardashians for making her want bigger boobs and plumped-up lips.But instead of reassuring her daughter that she didn’t need surgery, this mother gave it her blessing.Georgina justied this to Jeremy by saying she found surgery “quite addictive”, and revealed – unsurprisingly –  she is still not happy with her own look.It’s easy to wonder whether that therefore means she’ll be encouraging her daughter to wine, dine and dance for a few more older men.As mothers, we are meant to give our daughters self-esteem and confidence, not encourage them to surgically “improve” themselves.And for a mother to encourage her daughter to fund that surgery, as well as her own, by sleeping with a dirty old man The only explanation is that her moral compass is severely and sadly lacking.I can still remember going to watch Grease when it came out the first time. I got dressed up in a boob tube and skin-tight trouserswhen I was all of nine years old.And I can’t wait to see the prequel, although I probably won’t wear the boob tube this time around.Mind you, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that over the years so... never say never.WE all have moments of fantasising about just how much better le would bewe won the lottery and never had to work again.But for all too many people, realising their wildest dreams with a win turns out to be a le change that’s incompatible with the le they have lived so far.Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Colin and Christine Weir, have turned out to be the latest lottery casualties.This week they announced they’re orcing – eight years after scooping the £million jackpot.Colin, , and Christine, , took home the EuroMillions British record in  and had been married for  years before their recent split.In fact, let’s all take a moment to count our lucky stars that we haven’t won the lottery this week.IT’S hard to believe that Lori Loughlin and her husband could be facing  years in prison and fines of more than a million dollars for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern Calornia.I mean, yes, I know that bribing your child’s way through university is dishonest, dishonourable and not at all admirable.But  years in prison for doing so That does seem a little harsh.Justice has been served and his mum was given a -month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a -day rehabilitation activity.Far worse, though, she has now lost her son, who has been adopted into another family. Thank God for adopters.A judge told the woman – who can’t be identied for legal reasons – that leaving her son in such a state was “reprehensible” and “goes against the instinct of any caring mother”, which is true.Anyone who becomes a parent needs to understand that kids are forever.I speak from experience, by the way – mine are  and  and there’s still no independence in sight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past few weeks the EU has done just that to Theresa May.Only the dference is, we keep being flogged not because we tried to escape the EU but we failed to even TRY to escape.After all, we could have escaped with no deal on March , then again on April  and now we will have to put up with more floggings as we delay our departure until October.In the midst of this humiliating and embarrassing national failure, just when you think it can’t get worse, up pops the Chancellor glibly saying there will be a vote on holding another Brexit referendum and that the Government agree on a lot with Labour.This flies in the face of the fact that, in marginal seats around the country, Conservatives are aghast the Government wants to do a deal with Labour.Remember, this is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which wants a Customs Union, alignment with the EU single market and a second referendum.It’s BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.Worse, Corbyn’s brand of anti-British, Venezuelan-supporting Marxism is the single biggest threat to the UK’s future prosperity.Intriguingly, the Chancellor’s statement contradicts the Government’s previous view. After all, the Prime Minister used to say Corbyn wasn’t fit to be Prime Minister.The negotiating strategy it adopted has been aimed at trying to make an example of the UK to stop other countries thinking of leaving.At the heart of this has been their determination to insist on a deeply damaging set of proposals for the Northern Ireland border.It is these demands which have made it impossible to get a deal through the House of Commons. Those who believe in the importance of the union of the United Kingdom recognise the need to stand up for the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The EU’s arrogant refusal to continue negotiating a better way forward, using alternative border arrangements, is a deliberate attempt to interfere in the nature of the UK.In this they are supported by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose somewhat pompous elitism is in stark contrast to his poll ratings — which have been so low you could slide them under a snake.Instead of confronting the EU, prepared to leave by rejecting its deal, the Prime Minister has instead taken a dangerous decision.This is to agree to the EU demand for a longer extension, up to October  — a further  days of membership.This isn’t just a delay until October, it comes with strings attached. The EU demands that we fight next month’s Euro elections.This will be an utter disaster.At a cost to taxpayers of more than £million, and around £billion each month in EU membership fees, we would elect MEP’s who would have to leave office when we leave the EU in October.These will be elections no one really wants and would go down in history as the most pointless and expensive electoral mistake.There was a time when the Prime Minister had the sympathy of the nation. People used to give her the benefit of the doubt.They recognised that in a Parliament stuffed with an overwhelming majority of anti-Brexit Remainers, and with a Remain-leaning Cabinet, it was dficult for her.Most people I have spoken to hung on to the pledge the PM made to leave the EU on March .They remembered her constant refrain that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and persuaded themselves such a pledge would be delivered on.That all changed when we didn’t leave on March . Gone is that sense of sympathy and trust and in its place is a growing sense of betrayal. The country is crying out for strong leadership.Yet it is not too late. We can, even at this eleventh hour, rediscover our belief in the UK as a self-governing nation, the world’s fth largest economy and one of the most influential.After all, despite all the Project Fear warnings, while the Eurozone is mostly in recession the UK’s economy is growing, employment is at a record high and youth unemployment at a near-record low.No, we don’t need to fear anything.The Prime Minister has already said she is stepping down. She needs to heed the concerns, including those of her MPs, and not let this drag out.What better legacy than one where she recognises the optimism of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.They instinctively know that our best days are ahead of us. Now is the time to refuse to be bullied by the EU any more — no more national humiliation.If the EU won’t change their deal, she should say the UK will simply leave.Now that’s a great legacy, Prime Minister. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Firstly, they have a lot of top female obstetricians and midwives and she really wants a woman to deliver her baby.“The other is because they support alternative birthing methods and give the parents a lot of choice before, during and after the birth.“It is also, of course, very private, and seen as one of the safest places Meghan can give birth.”Buckingham Palace said this week that Meghan and Harry will not immediately share news of the birth of their son or daughter as they want to celebrate the arrival privately first.Royal bodyguards will be present when Meghan goes into labour — and security experts are believed to have “scoped” the maternity unit and given it their seal of approval.The maternity suite’s website says: “The Kensington Wing is designed to be a comprehensive maternity unit with private consultation rooms for your antenatal appointments, a medical day assessment unit, three labour rooms, a water-birthing suite, nursery, post-natal en-suite bedrooms and a luxury postnatal suite.“Our delivery rooms are furnished with all the equipment necessary to monitor you and your baby during labour and birth.“We encourage choices in birth position and can provide birth-balls, beanbags, floor mats, birthing stools and birthing pools. We offer all the services you would expect in a luxury hotel.”The Kensington wing — which is also where Cheryl Tweedy gave birth to her son with Liam Payne in  — offers smoked salmon for breakfast, £ bottles of champagne and private rooms with en suite bathrooms, TVs, fridges and wi.It also boasts , works of art, -hour room service, and complimentary toiletries.Obstetricians are available  hours a day and the suite offers one-to-one midwe care in labour. A consultant neonatologist carries out baby checks and there is full post-natal physiotherapy advice.Human rights lawyer Amal gave birth to daughter Ella and son Alexander at the Kensington wing in June .Our source added: “Meghan and Amal have grown extremely close.“Amal has become one of her dearest UK-based friends, and Meghan looks up to her and respects her.“She is listening to Amal and mum Doria a lot in the run-up to the birth. Amal’s influence can be seen in the choice of hospital and also in how Meghan plans to care for the baby after birth.”Meghan and Harry have recently moved into Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate while Amal and Ocean’s Eleven actor George live  miles away in Sonning, Berks.The Clooneys were star guests at the royal ­wedding in Windsor last May, while Amal was one of Meghan’s pals who attended her lavish baby shower in New York in February.Meghan and Harry have reportedly acted on Amal’s advice and hired celebrity nanny Connie Simpson — who has worked for A-list couples including Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake.Known as Nanny Connie, the childcare expert assisted with George and Amal’s twins for a short period and is set to work as a “family coach” — helping out along with Doria.In a previous interview, Connie said: “I’ll tell Meghan that in all the things you can give a person, the most important thing you can give is yourself and your love.“Meghan’s going to be overwhelmed. She needs to enjoy the moment and this special time with her baby.She’s going to be overwhelmed with information and ‘lookie-loos’ peering into her le. So I’ll say enjoy those ­subtle moments.”Meghan’s mother Doria — who also played a signicant role in the royal wedding — plans to be at the birth.The yoga teacher has told friends in the US she will be away “for a long while” as she comes here to help out the new parents.Our insider explained: “Meghan has been speaking to Doria a lot and is pleased she will have her by her side.“Meghan will be in charge but will be very grateful for her mother’s help and advice. She is not in touch with her father at the moment, but her bond with Doria is extremely strong and important to her.”Meghan and Prince Harry have been spotted at a posh wellbeing store as they prepare for their new arrival.Ilapothecary in Kensington offers “mother-to-be massages” with oils and balms and treatments focusing on encouraging “hormonal equilibrium”.And Meghan has enjoyed its “gong therapy” — a wellness trend that involves listening to the sounds that are rich in “harmonic frequencies”. The treatment — established in the US and growing in popularity here — “bathes” users in the meditative sounds of gongs and tuning forks.Practitioners claim the gongs have “vibrational energy” that reduces tension, and blood pressure, aids peaceful sleep and is calming for the unborn child.Meghan is expected to use similar calming techniques during the birth, including chanting routines, healing crystals and aromatherapy.But it’s not just royals and celebs who turn to New Age routines to help them with pregnancy and childbirth.Mum-of-two Natasha Harding used some of the methods when she had her son Zak in June  — and she reckons they will suit the Duchess of Sussex too.The -year-old writer from West Malling, Kent, said: “If it’s what Meghan wants to do, she won’t regret it.”“I used to tell people, ‘If I ever have a baby, I will ask for all the drugs they can give me.’“But when the time came I started reading up on what would happen.”To prepare herself for a natural birth, Natasha did yoga every day and used self-hypnosis to disconnect from the pain she would experience when her baby arrived.She also used healing crystals, massages and practised breathing for an hour a day to help her keep calm at the birth.During labour in her bathroom, Natasha burnt calming lavender oil.And she only had two puffs of gas and air before little Zak arrived weighing a healthy .lbs.Natasha, who is also mum to five-year-old daughter Lexi, said: “After Zak was born, I remember thinking I could do it all over again.“It will be amazingMeghan does the same thing. I am sure she will really benefit from it.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not to mention a convulsion of laughter when she accepted another six months’ membership on condition we behaved ourselves, effectively clamping an electronic tag on the ankles of Euro-haters who celebrated referendum victory as freedom from enslavement. But it’s going to be a hellish six months. And we need to impose some conditions on ourselves to stop the worst excesses of Brexit driving millions of us into depression or beyond. So here’s what I suggest. Theresa May, lose that blue coat and the addresses to the nation that say you mean business. We know you don’t. In fact, we know there’s nothing going on behind your mask as you’re a Doctor Who alien. John Bercow, stop thinking you’re being played by Tom Cruise in a blockbuster movie. You’re just the smallest sh** in the biggest sh**show. Unlock your ego.  The BBC, stop your “star interviewer” John Humphrys going softer on right-wing bores like David Davis than he would a Ku Klux Klan kangaroo court on a lynching party. Also, tell Laura Kuenssberg to have a lie down and scrap Question Time as it’s unhealthy to consume a pile of gammon before going to bed. We need to ban those yearners for the mythical pre-war, all-white uplands, called the ERG, from running to cameras to whine about betrayal. Keep Jacob Rees-Mogg under mansion arrest and force Mark Francois to admit he’s a Europhobe because at school he had his head stuck down the toilet every day while boys shouted “drown fat Frenchy, drown”. Commentators have to stop comparing Brexit with classic sitcoms like Fawlty Towers and Blackadder. They were funny. Brexit is as funny as Liz Truss. All TV stations must remove their gantries outside Westminster as they’re a wailing nutter magnet.    And those wailing nutters must be stuck in a glass, soundproofed pen in Parliament Square. If we’re having marches, let’s outlaw the painting of yellow stars or Union Jacks on people’s faces, and smug placards that point out bad spelling or grammar on other placards. We must remove from our language the phrases red lines, orderly withdrawal, meaningful or indicative votes. And make it a criminal offence to talk about surrender, D-day, Hitler, Normandy beaches and Churchill, or for anyone to say “don’t talk to me about Brexit” then proceed to bang on about it until your ears bleed. We have to outlaw all vox pops with voters who have changed their minds as we know you now think you were either “lied to” or just “want them to get on with it”. Stop treating Arlene Foster like she’s the head of state of some really important country. She’s not. Stop painting Jean-Claude Juncker as a lying, careerist alcoholic. The name you’re looking for is Nigel Farage.    And all MPs must cease looking for pity about working long stressful hours as we’ve more sympathy with lers being denied drugs in HMP Belmarsh. In fact, after their long Easter break let’s lock them in Westminster the way the Vatican does with ­cardinals and only release them when white smoke rises to announce they’ve reached a decision. Andthey can’t, then throw it over to us.

Amy Thornton, a forensic artist, used a D print from a CT scan of the prehistoric creatureaposs skull to recreate the animalaposs likeness.It is believed to be the size of a large Collie with similar facial characteristics to a European grey wolf, The Daily Record reports.The skull itself was found at Cuween Hill in Orkney in  - one of  discovered there along with the remains of eight human beings. It is thought the dogs were buried there more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting a ritual burial.    Ms Thornton used identical techniques to those the ones she would usually use to recreate a human head in her day job. She said: The reconstruction was originally created in clay using traditional methods, with a D print of the Cuween Hill skull as the base to build the anatomy on to. The completed sculpture was then cast in silicone and finished with the fur coat resembling a European grey wolf, as advised by experts. The resulting model gives us a fascinating glimpse at this ancient animal. Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at Historic Environment Scotland who co-produced the image, said: Just as they are treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.    But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago. Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the aposdog peopleapos. While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time. The model will go on display in Orkney this year.

But another daughter gave key evidence to friend Shahin MunirShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsShafilea went missing September  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Schoolgirl Shafilea Ahmed was brutally killed by her own parents.But without the key evidence from her friend, they may never have been caught. Pal Shahin Munir has now revealed how her bombshell secret helped to convict Shafileaaposs parents. Sixteen-year-old Shafilea was killed in  in a horrendous “honour killing” by her father and mother, who suffocated her by shoving a plastic bag down her throat after years of abuse. Her body was found in a river in Cumbria six months after she went missing from the family home in Warrington, Cheshire. But for nine years her parents, Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed, believed that had got away with the cowardly murder as police struggled to find evidence to charge them. It was only after one of the sisters, Alesha, broke ranks and agreed to testy in court that she had witnessed her parents kill Shafilea that they were finally charged with her murder.    But prosecutors knew that still might not be enough to convict them - until Shahin Munir came forward with a terrible secret she had kept for the last four years. Shahin produced photocopies of a letter, written by another of the sisters, Mevish, which described seeing the murder with exactly the same details as Alesha’s account. The evidence was now overwhelming and the Ahmeds were found guilty of the murder and jailed for a minimum of  years. Now Shahin has spoken of the moment she first discovered her friend had been murdered, and why she decided to break a vow of secrecy to reveal the secret in a new documentary When Missing Turns to Murder on the Investigation+Crime channel. Shahin Munir became friends with Shafilea and her three siblings after going to the same mosque as them.    After Shafilea was found dead one of them, Mevish, who was now  and studying at the same college as Shahin, began to confide in her about the cruel way her parents used to treat her sister. She said: “For one reason or another she started opening up to me about when Shafilea would be locked outside, that Shafilea would quite often be beaten up, how she wasn’t allowed to do anything. “There were physical beatings, they was a lot of emotional abuse going on, there was a lot of isolation for Shafilea where she’d be locked in her room or even outside. “When Shafilea was in the garden they would try to pass food to her without her mum seeing. “Our friendship was based on the fact that she would open up to me about the things that went on at home, and I was the person she would talk to when things got really bad. She had a genuine fear for her le too.”    When in , four years after Shafilea’s death, Mevish said she wanted to tell her something important, Shahin suggested she write it down in a letter. She said: “At that point I did have an inkling that it would be about Shafilea. I knew this was a big thing for her, I knew it took a lot for her to actually be able to trust me to this extent. “She messaged me saying, ‘Ok, I’ve written it down. “She was going to town that day with her mum, so I got there first and as they walked past she dropped the letters behind her without her mum seeing. “I picked them up and left as quick as i could, in fact i didn’t even look at them until I got home into my bedroom. I say cross-legged and started opening the letters.” Mevish had written in detail about the night her mother murdered Shafilea, while her brother and two sisters looked on.  She said: “They sat Shafilea down on this chair, they had this one chair where they would sit her and the family would gather round, and that’s when they started abusing her and beating her, one would hold her body and one would physically abuse her. “They got a plastic bag and they put it in her mouth and held her down on the sofa, and she struggled until she stopped. And then the kids were told to go upstairs to their room. “Her dad got rid of the body and her mum after came in the bedroom and got into bed with them like everything was normal. “And from that point on the kids understood, you’ll never talk about this again.” Describing her shock, she said: “I always understood the notion of honour within a family, I always understood the notion of shame within a community but I never believed that you could take it so far that you would kill your own.” In the letters the teenager told how Shafilea wet herself as she died, and her mother spent weeks constantly cleaning the sofa to get rid of it. And how they saw her dad put something in the boot of his car and drive off, believing it to be Shafilea’s body. And she wrote how she was constantly plagued by nightmares about the murder. Shahin remembered: “She asked for her letters back, which I knew she would, I think she was too afraid that somebody would find out. I met up with her gave her them back, and without even thinking she ripped them.”  But she had secretly made photocopies of the letters - which she kept for the next four years, telling no-one of their contents. A regular visitor to the Ahmed home before and after Shafilea’s death, Shahin saw the way the parents, who believed their daughter was becoming too “Westernised”, tried to control her. She said: “It was almost an uncomfortable feeling being around the family, because they seemed to be very controlled over everything they said, the conversations they had or what other family members were doing. Eldest daughter Shafilea wanted to wear western clothes like her friends, and have boyfriend she chose for herself. She  repeatedly refused her parents calls for an arranged marriage, which in her their eyes brought shame on the family. Shanin said: “Shafilea did have relationships with boys, you go to school with them, you get to know people. She was texting them but of course all of that had to be hidden. “It couldn’t be on her mobile phone in case her parents would check it, so that aspect of her le was very well hidden.” Six months before her death, Shafilea drank bleach in Pakistan after her parents took her there with the intention of marrying her off. Shanin recalled: “There were talks of a marriage to one of her cousins. She needed an escape, and for her the escape was, ‘I’m going to drink bleach. Because hopefully it’s going to end all of this’. All of her throat was completely burned from the bleach, she was very much skin and bones. Shanin said: “It was only when Shafilea was getting worse and worse that they were forced to buy aticket.  The story was told that actually she drank it by accident, she thought it was mouthwash.” Shafilea was killed on September ,  after her mother Farzana, , collected her from her call centre job and found that she was showing her arms by wearing a T-shirt. After killing her, Shafilea’s father Iftikhar, , is believed to have driven his daughter’s body  miles to Sedgwick, in the Lake District - where he dumped it next to the River Kent. Her remains were found five months later. Shanin said: “When Shafilea’s body was found it changed everything. It was found in a really horrible way and she must have had a really horrible death. It really upset me that someone in the community had died in such a horric manner.”  It was four years later when Mevish, unable to bear the burden of having to keep her sister’s death a secret, opened up to Shahin. Shahin, who had promised never to tell anyone, finally broke her vow of silence four years after that, after being impressed by the courage of Shafilea’s other sister, Alesha, who testied against her parents in court in August . Helen Morris, of the Crown Prosecution Service, described the moment Alesha stood up in court to face the parents who thought they would never be found out. She said: “She was screened from her parents, but the jury could see her. “They were absolutely gripped by what she was saying. She gave an account of how her mother had gone to collect Shafilea from her part time job in a call centre. “Shafilea was apparently wearing a T-shirt, was showing her arms and this had upset her mother.” She said that after getting into a heated argument at home, her mother “suddenly decided she’d had enough and she said words to effect of ‘let’s finish it here’. “She described how Shafilea was held down by he parents on the sofa, a plastic bag was stuffed into her mouth, they put her hands over her hands and nose so she was effectively being suffocated and the children who were all present watched their parents kill their sister.  “She described in great detail how Shafilea kicked her legs and how actually as she was losing control she urinated on the sofa. “Just the detail of how she saw her sister die was so compelling that it was quite clear she was telling the truth about what she had seen. The trial was already underway when police were contacted by Shahin. Ms Morris said: “She thought she had information which would be useful to the police investigating the case. By this time the trial was well underway. “The police met with Shahin and she told them that she had been so impressed by her courage in coming forward to give evidence that she felt she wanted to tell the police what she knew.” The judge then called Mevish as a witness, but she stayed loyal to her parents, claiming the story had been made up and was just an exercise in “creative writing”.

The security video shows a visibly-dishevelled Assange wearing a vest and shorts with his trademark long blond hair as he attempts to ride a skateboard round his dingy quarters. A female companion, believed to be advisor Stella Morris, watches on in the strange footage obtained by Spanish newspaper El Pais . Last week, the WikiLeaks founder was dragged kicking and screaming from the embassy in London, where he had barricaded himself on diplomatic refuge for fear of being arrested. He fears he could be extradited to face charges in the US, where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks. He could face up to five years in US prison.  Assange appeared in court last Thursday and  was found guilty of skipping bail in . He faces a jail sentence of up to  months when he is sentenced at Crown Court. He will next appear at Westminster Magistratesapos Court on May  by prison video-link in relation to the extradition case. It comes amid allegations from a Spanish security company hired by Ecuador to guard the Australian that he secretly spied on his Ecuadorian hosts.  Guards who worked for Undercover Global S.L said Assange would run the tap for fear British secret intelligence could be trying to listen in on his conversations in collusion with Ecuador. Listening devices were found inside Assangeaposs quarters - and when questioned by the Ecuadorian ambassador, his answers reportedly seemed “evasive”. Video monitors, a video recorder and also cooking equipment were installed in his quarters, which guards called The Batcave.  For months Assange had been trying legal action against the Ecuadorian government, accusing the South American nation of violating his rights by introducing strict house rules for living at the London embassy. Ecuador for their part believe the man known as The Guest was trying to hack the former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa. Ecuador finally gave him up, stripping his right to asylum before he was then found guilty of breaching bail in London last week.  It was believed the -year-oldaposs mental state was deteriorating the longer he was in the embassy - and was accused of smearing faeces all over the walls as guards grew annoyed at his hygiene and eating habits . Assange has been pursued by US authorities since  when he was involved in one of the biggest leaks in US government history - he has terried of the US coming after him ever since. But he has also been pursued on allegations of rape and sexual assault from  in Sweden, whose government are trying to extradite him. Assange denies the sexual assault and rape allegations."},{"url":null,"title":"man gets two offers bargain","story":"NewsMan gets two offers for bargain home - where he wants to live rent-freePeter Yielding, , wants £, less than neighbouring houses go for but the new owners will have to put up with himShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  APR NewsPeter Yielding is selling off his house for cheap, complete with a very special and surprising feature - himself \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man has slashed the price of his house by £, on condition he can live there rent-free after it sells. Peter Yielding, , wants just £, for his semi, which is in a street where the last house sold for £,. Despite his bizarre request, Peter says he has already had two “firm offers” for the house in St Albans, Herts. The listing on property site Rightmove says it has a garage and driveway and would be perfect for investors. But it also states: “The current vendor would like to remain at the property rent free as a long term tenant.”    Peter, who put the house on the market in February, said: “I just need the money. I’ll live here as a tenant.” The last house to sell on his street went for £, in January and another fetched £, last September. Some social media users mocked the advert, saying Peter should have been “laughed out of the estate agents”. But others described his offer as a “bargain” and predicted investors would be happy with the unusual catch.    One wrote: “This is possibly not as ridiculous as it first appears. £k is substantially less than what that gaff is worth. “I’d take on a long-term tenant for around £,, or whatever the dference in value is.” Leafy St Albans was recently voted the top commuter city for people working in London. The practice is called “home reversion” - where you sell all or part of your house in a cut-price deal. In exchange the buyer allows you to keep living there until you die or move into care. The older you are when you sell, the higher the percentage you will get of your home’s market value. This can work well for both parties but it can come back to bite buyersthe seller lives in their s or s.  In the most infamous example Andre-Francois Raffray agreed a knock-down price to buy -year-old Jean Calment’s flat in Arles, France. The -year-old lawyer signed a ‘viager’ deal in  to pay her £-a-month while she was still living in the property. Unfortunately for Mr Raffray, Mrs Calment ended up living another  years, becoming the world’s oldest woman. She outlived the new owner of her apartment, who paid more than double the flat’s value before his death in  aged . Mrs Calment died aged  in .

Members of the public are being invited to explore the stunning Frogmore House and gardens during a three-day charity open weekend in May. The coupleaposs wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at the historical Windsor building and their engagement photos were taken in the grounds. They reportedly had a summer picnic there in  before getting engaged.However a small area of the manor will be out of bounds when it throws open its doors next month in order to stop snooping royal fans peering into Meghan and Harryaposs new home Frogmore Cottage.By this time, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have welcomed their first child and be living as a family of three at nearby Frogmore Cottage on the estate. And it has now been confirmed there will be banned areas in the gardens of Frogmore House to stop prying eyes trying to get to close the coupleaposs newly-renovated -bed property, the s reports. As we reported last week, Meghan and Harry waved goodbye to their abode at Kensington Palace and moved into their new Windsor home as they prepare for their bundle of joyaposs arrival.   It is understood a £million renovation was carried out to turn the Grade II listed cottage into a family home, but work overran meaning their move in date was delayed. The home was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace saying Windsor is a very special place for the couple. The cottage is just  metres from the Long Walk - which is open to the public.    Frogmore house is also half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queenaposs summer residence, and St Georgeaposs Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Visitors on the open days will be able to explore the estate and see its own man-made lake, Frogmore Lake. It is also home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Those interred at the burial ground include King Edward VIII and his we Wallis Simpson - the orced American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in .

The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the gardens, initially flat, were filled with , trees and many rare and unusual plants.  Charlotteaposs Vice-Chamberlain, Major William Price, and the Rev. Christopher Alderson of Derbyshire transformed the estate, creating the winding lake, wooded mounds, glades, walks and bridges in the Picturesque style. Inside, there are grand and elegant rooms - including one decorated by th-century flower painter Mary Moser. Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of George III and Charlotte, painted garlands in The Cross Gallery. The Britannia Room is furnished with items from the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was decommissioned in . Watercolours by Victoriaaposs daughters, Princesses Victoria and Louise, are still in the House. Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements.  It was built by Hugh May, Charles IIaposs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding, low-lying marshy area. It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children. Victoria was fond of Frogmoreaposs peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat, visiting during her long widowhood and working on her papers there.

Ceri Baker says she went from being fit and active to suffering constant pain and discomfort following an operation in March . She was given a  minute procedure that promised to ‘change her le forever’, bringing an end to urinary incontinence.But now the -year-old is unable to have sex with her Peter, her husband of  years,  without it being ‘extremely painful’, Devon Live reports .The mum-of-three from Dartmoor canapost sit comfortably or do any of the physical activities and hobbies she always previously enjoyed with her children either.   Ceri documents her experiences on her YouTube video channel Vaginal Mesh Story Time .Sheaposs hit out at a decision by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellenceto issue new guidelines paving the way for the implants to be used again after a temporary ban. “This procedure was sold to me by the NHS as a small, minimally invasive procedure to relieve the stress urinary incontinence which I had developed since having my three children,” Ceri said. “It was something I did because I was leaking daily and it was annoying and embarrassing, especially when it came to running, carrying shopping and dancing on a night out. I was so bad I stopped having fun, but it caused no pain at all and I could in fact lead a perfectly ‘normal’ le, so long as I planned ahead. “My surgeon said to me ‘this operation changes women’s lives’, and it did, dramatically for the worse.  I was left in constant pain, she said. It never went away. The nerve pain was so severe that I needed to take strong nerve blocking medication toin any normal capacity. “I was back and forth to my GP and the surgeon, and had steroid injections twice under general anaesthesia. It never got any better and I was even considering having a hysterectomy.” In January the special educational needs coordinator  suffered a huge nerve reaction and hasn’t walked for more than  minutes or sit comfortably since then. “It was then I started making the YouTube videos, she said. I felt I had reached breaking point as I couldnapost sit at my desk to work and I felt constantly exhausted, and like I was being gradually poisoned.” Removing the mesh was the only hope Ceri felt was available to her to achieve ‘any form of normality’, but she had to fund it herself.    The mesh implants are designed to be permanent and during the first weeks after surgery become embedded in the surrounding tissue to provide better pelvic support. This means surgeons and doctors have to weigh up the risk of damage to nerves and nearby organs, including the bladder and bowel, before agreeing to their removal. “The NHS waiting time for referral, scans and surgery was looking likely to be over a year away, which is quite frankly a disgrace given the damage they have done to me,” she said.  “I paid for it privately in order to save myself. If I waited a year it is very likely I would have been unable to work or lead anywhere near a normal le. I was already struggling to do so and having to spend many days lying on the sofa working from home as I couldn’t sit on a chair for more than  minutes comfortably.  “Now, post-removal, I am unable to do anything at all physically and we have had to cancel yet another family holiday. I will need three to six months off work to recover and have been told it will be up to two years for full nerve and muscle recovery. “I am completely exhausted and maintaining good mental health is extremely challenging, especially as I am usually super active physically and mentally. “My main sadness as a mother is that I am losing precious time with my children again that I can never get back or ever be compensated for. Ceri, represented by medical negligence specialists Hudgell Solicitors, is currently taking legal action regarding the treatment she received and the impact the vaginal mesh implant has had on her le.  The implants are also currently the subject of an Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review into their use. Baroness Cumberlege, who is leading the review, said a number of conditions must be met before the use of vaginal mesh could again be considered safe – conditions she says have not yet been met and will not be for ‘some considerable timeapos. NICE said the limited evidence meant the true prevalence of long-term complications following surgery with mesh is unknown. An official at Englandaposs Department of Health and Social Care said: NICEaposs new guidelines and patient decision aids on managing urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse will help women make more informed choices about their treatment. The use of vaginal mesh was paused to ensure that patients receive a high-quality and consistent service. Mesh will still be a treatment for some women who understand the risks and following discussions with their consultant.

Teacher Gillian Sykes found out she had cancer in January and is preparing to have a double mastectomy operation in the summer, Liverpool Echo reports .She has had to quit work as a supply teacher but says she has been left to aposfight for survivalapos with the Department of Work and Pensions. Gillian explained how she has been turned down for support and was even made to take bank statements into the job centre just two days after her first draining bout of chemotherapy. She said she also had money taken away because of the DWP made mistakes over dates - and was eventually left with just p to live on, forcing her to rely on hand-outs from family and friends. Have you faced hardship because of Universal Credit  If so contact Mirror online at webnews@trinitymirror    Gillian was also told she needed to be looking for work - which the DWP later said was just an aposautomated response.apos The -year-old, who lives in Ashton-in-Makerfield with her two teenage children, spoke about the devastating moment she discovered she had cancer. She said: I found the lump myself on the th December when I was going to bed - and I cried myself to sleep. Weaposve got a family history of it - its the th anniversary of my mumaposs death this year. I was in an absolute panic and got an appointment shortly after - then two weeks later I was sent to see an oncologist who confirmed what I already knew, that it wasnapost a cyst, it was a solid mass. A week later I got given the news and things progressed quite quickly from there. Iaposve now had three rounds of chemotherapy. My hair is coming out in handfuls daily. This summer I will be having as double mastectomy - which is not nice. Gillian began a y, draining battle with the Department of Work and Pensions to get the benefits she needed to help her through an incredibly dficult time.    After her cancer diagnosis, Gillian said she was never told she qualied for Limited Capability for Work Related Activity - which is supposed to provide extra cash for those who are unable to work. She was left battling with the department for weeks in a bid to get the extra support. Gillian said: To be going through that is enough, only to then to deal with this - after paying into a system as a teacher system that I desperately need help from. Iaposm having battles left, right and centre with Universal Credit - and issues with not being told what I can and canapost claim. Iaposve had more support from Macmillan nurses than the government. Two days after my first chemotherapy session, I was told I had to take my bank statements in to the job centre to prove that they had taken money from me that they shouldnapost have. Iaposve had statutory sickpay penalised - I complained and complained. I spoke to a dferent person on the phone every time. I just feel like Iaposm fighting for survival with benefits, that I shouldnapost be fighting with right now. Iaposve got enough stress.  After spending weeks waiting to find outshe could get the vital extra LCWRA payments, Gillian decided to apply for what is known as a Universal Credit budgeting loan - used to help those who are struggling. She said: This particular month was really hard, I rang them to be told by someone that nothing was available to me because aposall the buttons were greyed out - and we donapost know why. Someone  told me nothing was available because I had earned at least £, in the last six months - well of course I did, Iaposm a teacher, I was working full time with my agency up until Christmas - so Iaposve been punished for actually going to work. What I do get from Universal Credit, Iaposm paying a mortgage, Iaposve got two kids. I didnapost expect this to happen to me. I have suffered with depression for several years, which has been greatly under control and I have been able to work - and this is now whataposs happening on a daily basis when I find out the next step, the next fight.

The following day she was told she would be backpaid hundreds of pounds that were owed to her, and an apology from the DWP followed. A spokesman told the ECHO: We have apologised to Gillian Sykes for the distress caused by this delay and are paying her full arrears. She has been placed in the long-term health condition group, meaning she receives a higher level of support and will not be required to seek work. “We want to ensure that anyone with a health condition gets the support they need, which is why the Government is rolling out a recovery package to support people diagnosed with cancer and over , people will benefit every year by .” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george princess charlotte cousin","story":"NewsPrince George, Princess Charlotte and cousin Mia enjoy funfair rides togetherDuke and Duchess of Cambridge and Mike Tindall kept a close eye on their Royal offspring at the Burnham Market horse trials as Zara competedShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  APR NewsPrince William and Mike Tindall look on as Prince George and Mia Tindall play together\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal cousins Prince George and Mia Tindall show that the going is fair on this family day out.

He said: What happens in the middle of this week is that we lose the chilly east, north easterly wind coming off the North Sea and begin to draw some of that warmer air from the south. What that means is that warmer air spreads from somewhere like Paris, which is expected to hit  or  degrees this Easter, and slowly moves north over the UK. Weaposre currently expecting Saturday to be the warmest day, with temperatures of around  or  degrees certainly possible - particularly in the south, and in certain well-sheltered parts of the west of the country like Devon, south Wales and north Cornwall.

The -year-oldaposs condition rapidly worsened and doctors pulled her husband Rory, , to one side and said: This is really serious now, do we have your permission to put her into a coma  It left Rory, from Guisborough, with what he described as a feeling of absolute terror that their kids would grow up without their mum. Lisa had initially thought she was suffering from the flu, but a few trips to the doctors couldnapost figure out what was wrong.    Then one day, around a year ago, things took a turn for the worse.Rory told Teesside Live : I had gone to bed, she woke me up in the early hours saying she couldnapost breathe,Her heart rate was absolutely crazy. Next thing you know she was getting rushed into resuscitation. I knew things were getting pretty serious then. Then they decided to move her to the high dependency unit.

Seriously.An unnamed woman has claimed her heavily pregnant bridesmaid upstaged her at the wedding before ruining the ceremony and helping to out her brother as gay. Itaposs a lot to take in.  The woman, who goes by the username aposIgnoredBrideapos, revealed all in a post on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. She starts by telling her fellow users that sheaposs been married for one and a half months and the big day took a whopping three years to plan.Everything was going well with the wedding planning, until one of her bridesmaids discovered she wasnapost going to be getting a plus one. She explained: We had six people on each side of the bridal party. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaid were single, including Anna, the star of this story.    I just wanted to give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones, Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off. Eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna married four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as a plus one and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers . And this is only the tip of the ice berg.She continues: [Anna] was hugely pregnant, and didnapost refrain from showing it off. Weaposre both fairly youngand in my husbandaposs culture, getting pregnant before late s s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION.The woman claims that all anyone could talk about during the wedding was Annaaposs pregnancy and her electric personality, which left the bride feeling upstaged.    When [Anna and her husband] got up to dance, all eyes were on them. Annaaposs friend ended up hooking up with my brother, outing him as gay and causing a huge scandal, she wrote. I ended up leaving midway through the reception in tears, and never attended the next morningaposs brunch. I canapost even look at the pictures without crying and desperately want a do-over. She goes on to reveal that the big day cost over £, and she feels like Anna owes her another wedding for what she did.    Iaposm not a bridezilla, she added, But this was beyond the pale. It felt like a celebration of Annaaposs marriage. Iaposm sorry but I put so much planning, effort and money into this while someone that got pregnant without a thought and married spur of the moment reaped the benefits. I honestly feel like Anna owes me a wedding and did all of this for revenge for me offending her years ago. More than  people have commented on the post, with many people slamming the bride. One person wrote: You are the a**hole and I donapost even know where to begin to explain why. Another replied: Itaposs not Annaaposs fault she decided to live her le. Your planning spanned three years without any consideration OR expectation of possible changes within the people involved. You are  percent a bridezilla. A third added: This whole post reeks of jealousy and insecurity and is just sad all round.

Miraculously, after an hour and a half of surgery, the rod was removed safely with hardly any bleeding or injury to the surrounding area.  Sanjayaposs main venous sinus to the brain was preserved by just millimetres, said Dr Giri. He said: Giving anaesthesia to the patient in such cases is dficult.

I attempted to summit Mount Kilimanjaro in , but I got really ill with altitude sickness and I wasn’t able to finish.“My dad used to read from adventure books when I was younger and I’ve always been interested in exploring.“So I thought this would be a good way to raise some funds.“Roxburghe House is an excellent NHS facility that always went an extra leap for my family and especially Mum in her last days.”Before Robert took off for Nepal, he trained for about three months.He said: “I would travel up to the Cairngorms and train for about four to six hours a day.“I also have a German Shepherd dog so I would go running up mountains and hills like Bennachie to keep my fitness up.“Towards the end I was just focusing on putting my kit together and getting the injections.”Aside from the adventure of climbing to Everest base camp, Robert had to first touch down in what is widely considered to be the most dangerous airport in the world – Lukla. vw, px\"  Robert said: “Lukla has a very interesting airport.“It’s basically on a clf and all I heard were the airplane’s machines beeping and it saying ‘pull up’ over and over – it was a bit nerve-racking.”Once on solid grund, Robert spent the first few days getting used to the weather and altitude sickness.“We had enough breaks to acclimatise and get used to the altitude,” he said.“I was able to visit the nearby villages and local areas, which was great.“For the trek itself, I wasn’t sure what to expect. All I had to base it on was my previous hike in Kilimanjaro, so I was worried about altitude sickness but I was really lucky this time.“One night it got to minus  degrees Celsius and the inside window of our hut froze over – it was grim. vw, px\"  “There was a snowstorm the day we got to the base camp and we had to head back down immediately.“The trek was a good way to clear my head while doing something good for charity.“And I couldn’t have done it without my partner Lucy Rowe, who was posting on social media for me and keeping the interest in the fundraising.”Although Robert is now back in the Granite City, his Nepal adventure has rubbed off on his le in other ways. He said: “I’ll be fixing up my back garden with the breathtaking colours I saw on the trip. vw, px\"  “I’ve just finished painting my shed red – that’s how I’ve brought back a piece of Nepal with me.”So far, the Torry resident has raised £, out of the £, he hopes to give to the NHS-run facility.To contribute to Robert’s cause and find out more information visit: bit.ly KpNWZo"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit navel gazing and naval support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe fraught question of Brexithas been exercising the thoughts of our contributor Ann Thomas.Tarbert artist Ann imagines a time in the not-too-distant future when we might have to resort to unusual means to export goods to the EU.Down in Westminster our politicians continue to squabble.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"young argyll players make their mark in shinty finals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnthusiastic crowds looked on as the  National First Shinty Championships were held across two Fort William venues.The GS Campbell finals on Saturday February  brought together more than  of the best young players from across Scotland, all vying for the coveted national P and P titles.The P and under tournament was played at the Nevis Centre and the standard of play throughout the day was of the highest order with all  teams giving a great account of themselves.Section A saw Aberdour edge out a classy Strachur Kyles side on goal dference to clinch second spot.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields south ayrshrie council","story":"NewsBob Shields: South Ayrshrie Council need new plan to build hundreds of homesRiiverside flats face being pulled downShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’ve dominated Ayr’s skyline for exactly half a century. They’re aesthetically unappealing, architecturally worthless and my three year old grandson could probably knock up an exact replica in Lego while his left hand was peeling the foil off his Easter egg. Carbuncles, eyesores, blots on the landscape - you can call them what you like. But for a couple of hundred people at least . . . it’s the place that they call ‘home’. Last week, South Ayrshire Council started the first phase of what could end in the demolition of Ayr’s trident of riverside flats. Officials began door knocking at Riverside Place as part of the promised consultation with the remaining residents to help decide whether the flats should be renovated . . . or simply razed to the ground. By all accounts – including my dear old  year old dad – the housing staff were considerate and sympathetic while listening to everyone’s point of view. And while the many senior citizens at Riverside didn’t exactly link their arms defiantly and chant “We shall not be moved” – they left the consultants with a similar but equally strong message - “We don’t want to be moved . . .” This leaves South Ayrshire Council between three, fourteen storey blocks – and a hard place. The flats all need “core” work to their internal cladding which has reached “the end of its design le”. To simply ignore the advice of the independent structural engineers isn’t an option. In this post-Grenfell era, the words “cladding” and “tower block” make even the pencils on a health and safety officer’s desk stand to attention. But with an estimated price tag of £ million for the renovations, South Ayrshire Council must balance whether saving Riverside Place is best value compared to simply knocking them down and starting a new-build site. They next conundrum for SAC is then the poser – is best value always best practice  Re-housing – and I mean satisfactorily re-housing – what is likely to be at least  people is a decant operation of Normandy proportions. Personally, I don’t think old Bob Snr is physically or mentally equipped to be transferred anywhere. And there must be dozens - or even scores - just like him at Riverside Place. A good place for SAC to start would be to put hundreds of minds at rest and pledge ‘no compulsory transfers’ out of Riverside Place. And after that . . . work out how the heck they can achieve it! Getting the number of tenants down to  – enough to fill two blocks – would be my starting point. Decanting from one block to a similar flat in another is the least intrusive option. I don’t like the phrase ‘natural wastage’ – but it can’t be ignored. Like anywhere  in the world, Riverside Place will have its share of residents who pass on to a much higher level than fourteen floors. I’ve also spoken to several residents who would seriously consider a temporary move to other parts of Ayr – in exchange for a ‘rent free’ package. Yep – it’s called bribery . . . but it could work. And it would mean work do be done to one block at a time – with residents moving between the two that are habitable. However,the final decision is to demolish Riverside Place, it’s a whole new ball game. Butthis really is the ‘pivotal point for Ayr town centre’ that everyone is talking about – it’s the ideal time for SAC to come up with a new local authority housing plan to build hundreds of new homes over the next few years. And finally, let’s not forget the third option. Empty the flats . . . surround them in scaffolding . . . cover them in white plastic . . . and forget about them!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"coral scottish grand national festival","story":"NewsCoral Scottish Grand National Festival set to welcome thousands to AyrMore than , race fans will attend the track over the course of the two day festival.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsRace fans are set for a great time at Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe stage is set for Ayr’s busiest weekend of  – the Coral Scottish Grand National Festival, writes Iain Ferguson.

Assistant Chief Officer for Response and Resilience Lewis Ramsay said: “Our crews across Scotland have had a challenging weekend attending numerous incidents. “Due to the outstanding collaborative working with land owners, The Forestry Commission and Police Scotland we have been able to ensure the safety of our communities. “I would like to thank the wider community for their ongoing support, the hard work of our partners, and the crews on the ground for their tireless efforts.” Firefighters are also still in attendance at a wildfire at Paul’s Hill wind farm near Aberlour. A number of fire engines were mobilised to the area after the call came in at .pm on Saturday, April . A wildfire warning was issued in conjunction with the Scottish Wildfire Forum for this weekend. Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended.They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildle and threaten the welfare of nearby communities - swallowing up emergency service resources. SFRS Area Manager Bruce Farquharson is the chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum. He said: We saw last year the devastating effect wildfires can have on communities and wildle. The dry and warm weather we are currently experiencing means there is a heightened risk of wildfire across the country. Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause signicant environmental and economic damage. Livestock, farmland, wildle, protected woodland and sites of special scientic interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The SFRS works closely with land managers, communities and other safety partners to prevent these incidents ever occurring. Area Manager Farquharson continued: At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation leftover from last year - this fuel can dry out quickly with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels. A great many people will be enjoying the outdoors in the good weather this weekend, we urge everyone to make sure that they don’t increase the chance of wildfire – be aware of the risks and follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Wildfires are a major threat to our wildle and wild places. We encourage people visiting the outdoors to be extra careful, and check the advice in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code before starting a fire. The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound.

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

The site has been vacant for many years and the evidence suggests it will remain so.But Councillor Norman Hampshire said: ldquoI cannot support the application: it would send a message to other owners of land designated for business use.The committee rejected the planning application by six votes to three.Following the meeting, Ms Leslie said: ldquoNaturally we are disappointed at the decision and are considering whether to appeal against it.ldquoWe have worked very closely with East Lothian Council over the last three years on a number of projects to enhance the provision of good-quality affordable homes in the area and have enjoyed a very positive working relationship with them.ldquoOur proposal for Prestonpans was a design and build project for  homes, very similar to our recently completed development at the disused site of the former boatyard in Cockenzie. This proved to be extremely popular and was vastly oversubscribed, so there is an urgent need for homes like ours.ldquoWe understand that this site in Prestonpans had been earmarked for commercial use but, in the absence of any confirmed interest, we had hoped that our plans, which would enhance the local environment and provide much-needed affordable housing, would have been supported."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-was-five-and-a-half-times-over-drink-drive-limit-in-prestonpans","story":"Gayle Duffy has been banned for  months after she was caught with mcg of alcohol in ml

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient

agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are

Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

Follow The Threads, which opens at Glasgows Lighthouse museum on Friday, includes artefacts from the Vale of Leven-based United Turkey Red Company, Templeton  Stoddard Carpets and and Paisley thread manufacturers JP Coats and Clark  Co.It will also focus on House of Fraser: the venerable UK retail chain which began in , when James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened a small drapery shop on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street, Glasgow. That companys records are voluminous. \"The House of Fraser archive extends to  metres,\" says McDade, indicating long rows of floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked with cardboard boxes and antiquarian leather-bound volumes. And what a tale these fusty old log books tell, recording, as they do, the way tastes and aspirations have evolved over generations.Despite its humble origins, House of Fraser went on to become a retailing giant, buying up companies such as Army  Navy, Binns and Harrods until it owned  stores at its peak. McDade pulls out a large folder bulging with yellowing envelope files, each containing a dress catalogue, fabric sample or advertisement stamped with the branding of John Falconer  Co Ltd. Founded as a drapers in , this Aberdeen-based company would eventually own four department stores before being acquired by the Scottish Drapery Corporation Ltd, which in turn was bought by House of Fraser in .The folder we are looking at dates from the companys early s heyday. One beautully illustrated catalogue displays pages of \"graceful afternoon gowns\", \"boudoir suits\" and \"tailored coats for matrons\". What are \"matrons\", I wonder  \"Women like you or me,\" suggests McDade ndash meaning, I suspect, \"past the first flush of youth\" though presumably, given the price tags, fairly well off. One elegant coat retails at four pounds,  shillings and sixpence ndash almost a fiver, but equivalent to around pound in todays money. Ten shillings and sixpencewould buy you a set of pure wool long johns and vest, fetchingly modelled by a jaunty gent with a military-looking moustache.As McDade points out, however, in the s, \"you generally didnt get ready-made clothes, you bought fabric, went home and made garments\". Twelve shillingswould buy two yards of \"Morocaine\", an \"uncrushable\" synthetic silk available in \"dove, salmon, rustic plum\" and a shade called \"zulu\". What might that be, wonders McDade, hinting that the colour terminology used by empire-era textile companies could be appallingly racist.As the th century advanced, department stores began to offer off-the-peg clothing. \"Think about Are You Being Served,\" says McDade. \"Youd have someone on the furs department and someone  on the ladies unmentionables section. Dferent people would be trained up to these specialisms and theyd take great pride in it.\"Speaking of furs, one  catalogue advertises an expensive range of winter coats in musquash, mink marmot, pony and squirrel. What all this tells us, says McDade, is \"what women of a certain class were wearing. Obviously, your tweenaged servant wouldnt be rushing out to buy a fur coat but they would all aspire, just like we do today. Weve got the Kardashians theyd be looking at the movies and saying, Oh, did you see Greta Garbo in her big fur coat  That was the style of the time\".Before we leave the House of Fraser archive, McDade picks up an expensively produced  brochure. \"Hurrah! Hes  today,\" declares the cover blurb above a photograph of a handsome young man. A peek inside reveals the menu of \"a Christmas luncheon given by the directors and executive staff of the House of Fraser in honour of Mr Hugh Fraser junior on the occasion of his st birthday ... a milestone in the companys history\".The six-course French-themed meal at Glasgows Central Hotel looks delicious but although at , \"Mr Hugh\" became a director with responsibility for all the family firms Scottish stores, the managements \"loyal greetings\" and wishes for his \"health, happiness and success\" were only partially realised. While he did take over the House of Fraser empire on his fathers death in ,  years later he was fined under the Companies Act for the misclassication of a loan and improper share dealings. Hed been selling House of Fraser shares to finance his gambling.He died in  aged just .That birthday menu wont feature in Follow The Threads, but it offers a tantalising taste of the treasures waiting to be discovered in the universitys extensive business archives and McDade hopes the show will encourage people to explore for themselves some of the \"vast range of stories\" to be found among the racks and ledgers.She also hopes it will highlight the textile industrys pivotal role in Scotlands industrial history ndash a legacy thats often overshadowed by heavy industries like shipbuilding and engineering. \"In the mid-th century, one in  of the Scottish population was employed in the textile industry, says McDade. ldquoIt was really important. Why did we need the ships and the railway  It was to get products to market, to export and import ndash and textiles really were the driving force behind the industrial revolution,you think of inventions such as the spinning mule.\"The show doesnt gloss over the industrys dark side: there are photographs of child mill workers, references to industrial accidents and a list of factory \"rules and regulations\" including stern warnings about the wage-docking consequences of being late for work.Theres also a Glasgow Herald press cutting from , reporting on the day the River Leven turned \"blood red\" following a leak from the United Turkey Red factory which poisoned all the fish. Established in , that dying company was famous for producing a vibrant and durable shade of red that was extremely fashionable ndash not least, among Indias well-to-do Hindu population. \"It was a technique that had come from the Middle East,\" explains McDade, \"but it had been perfected in Britain and was then exported back to India.\" Follow The Threads will feature sumptuous fabric produced by the company, which was, according to the exhibition blurb, ldquolargely responsible for creating the communities in the Vale of Leven.The companys closure, in , was a huge blow to the area and today, says McDade, theres little physical sign that it ever existed.Glasgows Templeton Carpet Factory is perhaps better remembered, partly because the famous Glasgow Green building remains as an abiding monument to a business which once employed thousands. In its prime, Templeton and Stoddard produced carpets for three royal coronations as well as for luxury ocean liners such as the Titanic. The show includes photographs of the mainly female workforce and even some of their voices. Last year, Strathclyde University research student Rory Stride interviewed seven women whod worked in the Templeton Carpet Factory during the s and s, and their stories are illuminating.They told Stride that the weaving machines were so noisy, workers invented a kind of sign language in order to communicate above the din. They said the air was often dirty and foggy with carpet fibres. But they also told him theyd enjoyed the workplace \"banter\" that they used to \"bang their bobbins\" along to the rhythm of the Dave Clark Fives Glad All Over, during the single hours radio listening they were allocated each morning.They talked of the lasting friendships theyd made in the factory and of the \"downbeat mood\" that descended in December , when the entire workforce were issued with redundancy notices following the companys merger with Stoddards of Elderslie. And tellingly, many said that no-one before had ever asked them about the work theyd done in that famous factory.As Claire McDade points out, the vast majority of textile workers were female. Could that explain the relative obscurity of the industrys history  Perhaps. Finally, however, those carpet workers stories are being told, with extracts from their testimony expected to feature in Follow The Threads.Right now, McDade and her colleagues are putting the finishing touches to the show ndash spinning yarns that deserve to be told about the people who produced and sold the fabrics that clothed the world.Follow The Threads is in Gallery One of the Lighthouse, Mitchell Lane, Glasgow April -May  www.thelighthouseFor more information on the Glasgow University Archives visit www.gla.ac.uk myglasgow archivesBrowse the House of Fraser archive on www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"perthshire-project-sells-birch-water-for-health-properties","story":"For the first time, a commercial operation has begun in Scotland to take and bottle the ldquobirch water and sell it to the public.Gabrielle and Rob Clamp use maple syrup kits bought from Canada to syphon off the natural tonic which is reputed to cleanse kidneys and liver, ease arthritis and rheumatism, and help strengthen teeth.The process is popular in Finland and the Baltic countries and the water is drunk by celebrities including Victoriarsquos Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. But it has never been seen here on a large scale.However, there is a history of birch water in Scotland going back millennia. Rob, whose company Birken Tree collects around , litres of sap each year, says: ldquoWe trace it back at least , years. There was a Neolithic lady whose body was dug up in Caithness where I am from and there was evidence of some food and some of that was birch sap. In the Highlands there are records of people using it as a tonic after a long winter giving it to babies, themselves and even cattle. It makes sense because it is so full of minerals and vitamins and it is a lean period .Although still known about in other countries Rob says there could be a simple reason its use died out here. ldquoThey have a very dferent history to us in Scotland. People were cleared away to the New World and that connection to the land was severed.Sat amid the birch trees of Grandtully Forest in Perthshire, Rob explains the unique taste: ldquoI like the silkiness of it, almost creamy. There is a very slight sweetness, depending on the tree or the season. Some people compare it to melons or cucumber, it is very subtle.When they first tapped the sap last year Gabrielle said she was ldquoexcited: ldquoWe realised the taste of fresh sap was dferent from the bottle we had before ndash we really loved it. That is why we use glass bottles to keep the taste right. And,you warm it up slightly the flavours are more intense.There is usually only a three week window to gather the sap in spring because as the warmer months arrive it develops a bitter taste.However, the season has been is longer this year though because the warmer weather in February meant they started in the second week of March.They collect about , litres a year but estimate that each tree only loses a tiny amount of its sap. Rob says: ldquoWe take about one per cent. We know they take up s of litres a day and we take about five.Gabrielle gave up a job as a chiropractor to concentrate on the business. And while Rob still works as a forester he aims to concentrate on their start up business full-time.Internationally, the market is worth millions of dollars and Gabrielle and Rob were introduced to it when a friend gave them a bottle marked ldquoMade in Finland.Gabrielle says: ldquoWe thought someone must make it in Scotland but no. As a result, they became the only Scottish producers on a commercial level, selling to local delicatessens and through a wholefood distributor.Gabrielle adds: ldquoThere are lots of vitamins and minerals, enzymes and amino acids. There is xylitol as well which is good for the teeth.ldquoA lot of people askit iswater because it is called birch water but no, it is pure sap.The sap ferments in three days so they freeze it and then pasteurise it a little to give it a longer shelf le.Rob says: ldquoAt some point it would be nice to focus on it full time and we have launched a crowdfunding campaign. Growing the business will mean adding flavours such as cranberry, bilberry and meadowsweet and also creating sparkling birch water which has been asked for by high end hotels and restaurants.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, , has written about birch water on her Facebook page saying the ldquonutrient-dense liquid is a ldquohero ingredient.Despite the trendy, modern feel to the product Rob insists its , year history means what they are doing is ldquonothing new. He adds: ldquoWhat we are saying is lsquohello, you should be drinking this stuffrsquo.Hayley Bruce, Commercial Marketing Intelligence Manager at Scotland Food  Drink, said: ldquoScotland has a rich heritage when it comes to food and drink production and it is great to see traditional techniques being adopted in the modern world. Searching through the past for inspiration, whether looking for ancient wisdoms, indigenous ingredients or heritage produce, can open up some fantastic new opportunities for the Scottish food and drink sector."},{"url":null,"title":"less-than-half-of-universal-credit-claimants-have-rent-paid-directly-to-landlords","story":"A majority of iniduals who get the housing element of Universal Creditare receiving the payment themselves, a practice critics believe can lead to rent arrears.Labour MSP Mark Grfin said:ldquoUsing new social security powers to ensure housing benefit is automatically paid direct to landlords to protect the roof over peoplersquos heads is a no brainer.Universal Credit, a means-tested payment which is replacing a number of existing benefits, is one of the biggest shake ups of the social security system in decades and is being rolled out across the the UK.Although the benefits system is largely reserved to Westminster, Holyrood has flexibility over some payments as well as having top up powers.Under the Scotland Act , Scottish Ministers can introduce flexibilities in relation to who receives UC and when.Options include paying UC twice a month rather than every four weeks, splitting payments between partners in a household, and paying the UC housing element directly to social and private sector providers.Surveys by housing associations have also found that UC claimants are more than twice as likely to be in rent arrears as people who did not claim the benefit.However, of the , UC households in Scotland that receive the housing element of the payment only goes to the landlord in , of cases.The number of UC households not signed up to direct payment currently stands at ,.In evidence to Holyrood last month, John Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords, said UC should go straight to accommodation providers in all cases. He said:ldquoPrivate landlords in Scotland want to provide high quality accommodation to anyone who wants it, including those receiving Universal Credit. However, landlords are constantly frustrated and discouraged from doing so because of the uncertainty inherent in the current system.ldquoWe want to see changes made that would see the housing element paid directly to landlords in all instances. This would provide a degree of certainty and help prevent tenants getting into rent arrears, thus encouraging private landlords to continue to provide housing to those on Universal Credit.Grfin said: ldquoAcross the country thousands are suffering the misery of Universal Credit, and are still having to juggle paying the rent heating their home or eating. We need to do more to prevent arrears building up, risking low-income families becoming homeless.ldquoLast year, Holyrood unanimously agreed payments of Universal Credit should be automatically split amongst both members of a couple and, with growing support from landlords and experts across the housing system, itrsquos time we did the same for rental payments.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe think it is important that the person has the choice about whether or not to have the housing cost element of their UC award paid to their landlord, just as they have choicethey are paid monthly or twice monthly.ldquoIn line with our social security principles of respect, dignity and fairness, we support people to make an informed choice based on their own needs and what works best for them."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-theresa-mays-zugzwang-means-a-long-hot-summer-of-indecision-on-brexit","story":"What I didnt foresee is that Theresa May would still be in office after being forced to go to Brussels, twice, to beg for an extension to A. Not only was this a national humiliation, and a breach of promise, it has cost nearly pound.bn in No Deal preparations that had to be cancelled.Whatever happened to ldquoNo Deal is Better than a Bad Deal  Or the PMs insistence that holding European elections would be ldquoutterly unacceptable. Has a prime minister ever in history been so wrong so often and yet remained in office  I cant think of one. Theresa Mays staying power is formidable and has become a political force in itself. They used to say that, after a nuclear war, the only ones left would be cockroaches and the indestructible chanteuse, Cher. But Theresa May will still be there too, lecturing insect le on the merits of her Withdrawal Agreement.While she remains in office, nothing can really change. Indeed, the six month stay of execution on Brexit, awarded by the European Union last week, almost guarantees that nothing will change. The pressure is off. Negotiations with Labour over the customs union will surely stall. Brussels wont reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and neither will the DUP and Tory hard liners accept it. Theresa May is still blocking a Peoples Vote, about which Jeremy Corbyn is anyway distinctly cool.The European Elections are going to be an unavoidable nightmare for both the big parties. The Tories will suffer mass defections from disgruntled No Dealers. Labour will likely be torn apart over its manesto. The membership will want to include a Peoples Vote, which many Labour MPs, especially in northern English seats, will bitterly oppose.The new independent party, Change UK, will try to syphon of disgruntled Labour and Tory Remain voters, and could do quite well. Six million peopled have signed the parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be Revoked and they will want to turn the European elections into a proxy referendum. But the Tiggers will be fighting for votes with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.One consolation is that the Brexit right is split also. Under Nigel Farage, Ukip came out top in the  EU elections and even won a seat in Scotland. On Friday, Mr Farage, launched his own rival political vehicle, the Brexit Party, following Ukips lurch to the Tommy Robinson far right.Thats going to be confusing for Leavers because Ukip is an established political brand. But it was essentially the Nigel Farage party, so it seems likely that his new Brexit Party could succeed in being the natural destination for hard Brexiteers. By the same token, moderate Tories will not want to touch anything led by Nigel Farage and will probably not vote at all.The one party which should do well hands down in the European elections is the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon will happily hoover up the independence and Remain votes. Labour has stalled badly in Scotland under Richard Leonard, and the Tories are indelibly tarnished by the behaviour of Theresa May and the Brexit right. Were the six Scottish MEPs to be elected on first past the post, the SNP might well have swept the board come May rd. But the European elections are conducted under a strict version of PR, so the SNP target will probably be to increase from two seats to three.After the European Elections, Theresa May, assuming she is still there , will presumably try to put her deal to parliament for a fourth time, or seek to have the Withdrawal Deal ratied by other procedural means, given that the Speaker has blocked a fourth Meaningful Vote. This will almost certainly fail, and a war-torn parliament will collapse into the long summer recess with ill-disguised relief.Nothing ever happens in Brussels over the Summer months, so discussions with Europe will stall, and in the autumn the EU will be pre-occupied with installing a new President of the European Council, replacing Donald Tusk, and a new President of the European Commission, replacing Jean Claude Juncker. This discontinuity means Brexit is in danger of falling into black hole of indecision. Europe is fed up with Britains Brexit psychodrama, and just want us to go away.Back in the UK, the run up to the latest Brexit deadline on Halloween, st October , will be by the UK party conferences. Both Labour and the Conservatives will be hopelessly ided. There will be harsh words in Labour between supporters of Mr Corbyns managed Brexit and supporters of a Peoples Vote who constitute the majority of Labour activists, especially the younger ones.The Tories will be even more ided at their party conference in October. The pro-Brexit representatives of the Tory grass roots will have their first opportunity to vent their collective frustration at the leadership, and Theresa May in particular. Andshe still tries to promote her deal, which is loathed by the hard Brexit Tory membership, she will be roasted by representatives who are in a state of incipient rebellion.The PM will almost certainly come out of the Tory conference having had to harden her Brexit negotiating position against the customs union compromise. Liam Fox the International Trade Secretary, has told the Tory backbench  Committee that a customs union is incompatible with Brexit and that Britain would be ldquostuck in the worst of both worlds.With her options closed off, and with the Halloween deadline approaching, Theresa May will be left trying to run down the clock as before. Presumably parliament will again intervene to vote against hard Brexit. So the PM may have to go back to Brussels, cap in hand, on November st asking for another extension. Brussels will hum and haw about this, and no doubt Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will continue their bad-cop-good-cop routine, before stling their giggles and giving the UK yet another stay of execution.This time it might be permanent because the May government would surely fall, and there would be a general election. I know that I said as much last time, but there must be a limit to Theresa Mays ability to struggle on in the face adversity. The DUP and the hard Brexiteers of the ERG are incorrigible.She cannot get her Withdrawal Deal through parliament and she cannot strike a deal with Labour without destroying her own party. In Chess this is called a Zugzwang, when the king has to make a move, even though every option makes the situation worse.

Chanting, whistles, the thud and clatter of rocks hammering into walls and metal barricades and the ominous occasional pop, pop, sound of automatic weapons fire.In the darkness, barricade bonfires and the occasional bursts of flame from petrol bombs hurled from buildings spilled across the street.In the moments of light it was possible to make out the silhouettes of supporters of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Many rushed forward in yet another vain attemptto retake Tahrir Square from government opposition supporters who had turned the central Cairo landmark into the epicentre of their revolution.As daylight broke, these same opposition supporters who had camped in the bitter cold overnight repelling the onslaught, rose to face another day of stand-offs and fighting. So too did the soldiers of the Egyptian army, whose tanks and personnel carriers sat in the square as calls for a crackdown against the opposition grew.The opposition billed it as the ldquoDay of Departure, and as the early morning sounds of the muezzinrsquos call to prayer reverberated across the city, the calls for Mubarak to go also grew louder. ldquoDown with the regime, they chanted over and again.Those were heady and violent days back in  when I witnessed the overthrow of Mubarak. But they were also days too of hope for those who sought political change, as the early salvoes of the Arab Spring uprising reverberated in Egypt just as they had in Tunisia weeks before and would in the months to come from Libya to Yemen, Syria to Bahrain.In the eight intervening years since those momentous times, many people have pronounced the hopes of the Arab Spring as being dead and buried. They are lost they say to the likes of the military rule that now prevails in Egypt or the ruins of Syriarsquos cities obliterated in the civil war that followed the uprising there.Then came those nine extraordinary days over the past week or so during which two of the Arab worldrsquos most entrenched autocrats were deposed.In Algeria and in Sudan, the departures of Presidents Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Omar al-Bashir both of whom weathered the turmoil of , has sent fresh shock waves across the Middle East and North Africa and given rise to talk of a new Arab Spring.Those massive crowds we have seen on the television news lately clamouring in Khartoum for the removal of President al-Bashir of Sudan, so evoke the crowds that gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo or outside the Tunisian interior ministry eight years ago. All of a sudden it appears that the popular uprisings of - were not the dead end many have portrayed them to be.But is what we are witnessing in Khartoum and Algiers, really the brewing of a new Arab Spring andso will the outcome be any dferent this time around According to Georges Fahmi, a research fellow on the Middle East programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs , the straightforward answer to the first question is yes, eventhe final outcome of these latest protests is as yet unknown.ldquoThe  Arab uprisings had four main characteristics: they were nationwide, sustained over time, political in nature and interconnected. This new wave of protests ticks all of these four boxes, says Fahmi.He highlights the fact that in both Sudan and Algeria, for example, the ongoing protests have spread across dferent cities, including the capital cities of Algiers and Khartoum. Also that the protesters have been able so far, to sustain their activities for three months in Sudan and one month in Algeria.ldquoThis wave has also gone beyond socio-economic grievances to develop clear political demands evidenced by its slogans, lsquoJust fall that is allrsquo in Sudan and lsquoNo to the fth mandatersquo in Algeria, as well as other slogans borrowed from , explains Fahmi.For years leaders in countries like Sudan and Algeria have sought to stoke fear in their people and warned against such mobilisation in popular revolutions. The misery that ensued in places like Libya and Syria following the uprisings there in  has also been invoked as a deterrent.But what has become increasingly clear is that the root causes of these previous uprisings have not been addressed and continue to fester, making for a political timebomb among the populations of countries like Sudan and Algeria.Across swathes of North Africa especially, regimes there have imposed austerity measures, cutting food, energy and fuel subsidies. And just as joblessness has soared so too has living costs.Currently the Arab world has the worldrsquos highest youth unemployment rate, with about  per cent of  to -year-olds out of work.The World Bank predicts thatcurrent demographic trends persist, the Middle East and North Africa will need to create more than m jobs by .Just to keep up with the regionrsquos demographic bulge, the countries affected need to ldquocreate immediately more than m jobs a year, it warns.For the moment though what prevails in the lives of most people is a vicious cycle of being asked to do with less while political freedoms are increasingly restricted.Faced with such challenges, lessons from the past and whether they are heeded now is what will determine the final outcome of the present uprisings.Activists in Sudan and Algeria all say they are fighting to escape the fates of the Arab states that rose up in . All of those countries, except for Tunisia, have either plunged into chaos or reverted to authoritarianism.How ironic it is that back in Egypt in , Islamist activists worried openly about how to avoid what they called ldquothe Algeria scenario. Most being well aware that only twenty years earlier, Algerian generals had cancelled a parliamentary election to prevent an Islamist victory at the polls, and that for the next  years, the Algerian army and the Islamists fought a civil war that killed more than , people.Now Algerians are acutely aware of the need to avoid the \"Egyptian scenario\", whereby the army becomes the controlling body with all the repressive implications that could bring.Algeria after all is an institutionalised, multi-party state, run by a military and economic elite. These elite knows how to oppress the public, suppress criticism, lock up rivals and sometimes kill them, but are also aware of the publicrsquos power.When the moment came in the past few weeks to force President Bouteflikato resign, it was the army that pressured him to avoid confrontations with the public.In so doing of course the army allowed the elite to stay in power, something those on the streets of Algiers are determined should not persist. No point in getting rid of one authoritarian member of the old guard only to have him replaced by the countryrsquos opaque circles of generals and businessmen goes the protesters thinking.For years, Arab autocrats have relied on ldquosocial contracts to maintain stability, in effect using state pay-offs funded by petrodollars set against limited political freedom and this could still prove a dficult cycle to breakSome commentators and analysts remain sceptical that the current protesters are capable of ensuring this will happen.ldquoIf anyone insists on calling the moves in Algeria and Sudan the second chapter of the Arab Spring, they will have to make do with seeing it as the Arab Spring of the army and elites wishing to defend themselves, insisted Zvi Barrsquoel correspondent for the Israeli Daily newspaper Haaretz.ldquoThe publicrsquos awareness of its power was forged in the ldquooriginal Arab Spring, and this may be the most signicant achievement of these revolutions. But this awareness alone has not generated the real revolutions that will probably have to wait for another round, Barrsquoel concluded in one of his columns over the past few days.Whatrsquos certainly not in doubt though, is that whats occurred over the past nine days in Algeria and Sudan has firmly knocked on the head the old racist concept that ldquoArabs are not ready for democracy, because they are Arab.ldquoThe notion that Arabs need dictators to rule over them is a convenient myth for bigots and their symbiotic relationships with autocrats who have poor views of their own people, HA Hellyer, senior associate fellow at RUSI and the Atlantic Council was quoted in the UK press as saying over the last few days.ldquoIt has been proven wrong, again and again, and Algeria and Sudan, notwithstanding the vast ersity that exists in those countries, that are Arab but also African and have many identities, shows the shallowness of that myth, argued Hellyer, as events rapidly unfolded in both countries.And so for the time being Algeria and Sudan stand at a political crossroads. Where both countries go from here largely depends on a combination of internal and external elements. Internally the behaviour of the army and security services in both will be crucial. Also too will be the question of leadership within the protest movement. If there is one worrying parallel with the Arab Spring of  in Algeriarsquos protests itrsquos that they lack any obvious leader. The mostly young protesters are a movement with no formal organisation, no recognisable representatives. This was a fatal flaw back in  in that it meant its supporters had nobody to negotiate a transition to a more democratic system or to manage the protestersrsquo expectations.Externally meanwhile the outcome of the protests will also be determined by the response from the international community and in this respect there are clear dferences with the Arab Spring uprisings of .Itrsquos hard to see how this second wave of uprisings will gain the same support as that received by the first wave. Given the traumatic experience of the first wave, particularly in Libya and Syria, many Western policymakers will likely think twice before showing their support for political change in the region.Also since  right wing parties have gained power in several Western countries, most notably in the US, which have prioritised issues of migration and counterterrorism at home over political freedom and human rights abroad.Again looking back, Washingtonrsquos response to the Arab Spring of  was one of the greatest foreign policy failures of President Barack Obama.While his administration encouraged the ouster of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, when subsequent elections produced a government led by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood the Obama administration was lost for a response.Indeed it said next to nothing too when the Egyptian army stepped in and put into the presidency the military chief, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.Obamarsquos successor Donald Trump as we all know by now, has a penchant for so-called ldquostrongmen. On Thursday the State Department hailed the ldquohistoric moment as Sudanrsquos al-Bashir was toppled, but appeared to be taken by surprise with a senior official just days earlier declining to describe the mounting protests as a ldquocrisis.In both Sudan and Algeria, the US has only gently encouraged the two countriesrsquo new military leaders to support democracy, voicing support for ldquothe people.ldquoFor more than two years, the Trump administration has gutted Americarsquos diplomatic tools to respond to the complicated political transitions unfolding in Sudan and Algeria, and his team has made freedom and democracy a much lower priority in Americarsquos foreign policy agenda than any other US Administration in recent memory, warns Brian Katulis, senior fellow at the independent policy institute, the Centre for American Progress.Looking back now to those heady days of  itrsquos easy to be sceptical of the potential for a successful outcome to the protests in Sudan and Algeria. What they have shown though is that citizens in North Africa and the Middle East are sick of tyranny and long to participate in the shaping of their own societies. Those citizens too have also learned lessons from mistakes made back then.During the recent protests in Algeria, ordinary Algerians handed each other bottles of water and snacks, and cleaned the streets after themselves in gestures of civic pride. In Sudan, the protesters elevated women to leadership positions within the crowds and across both protests there was a spirit of non-violence.Itrsquos clear that the aspirations that surged to the surface right across the Middle East and North Africa early in  have not been killed off. The Arab Spring without doubt is definitely being revisited."},{"url":null,"title":"six-changes-that-could-transform-council-finances","story":"Here are six radical suggestions that could transform the fortunes of our local authorities:Scrap council taxUNISON is calling for council tax to be replaced by Land Value Tax , a proposal favoured by economists and deemed to be fairer to those living in low-value homes.It is one of the most important forms of income for councils, and along with business rates, fees and charges, is used to pay for everything from bin collection and roads maintenance to libraries and leisure centres.Experts have long criticised the current system, saying the inaccurate banding structures which use the value of property in  to determine how much householders have to pay are slanted in favour of those in high-value homes. Those living in the lowest-value homeswill pay around a third of what those in the highest valuepay, although band H homes will be worth at least eight times those in band A. The system hasnrsquot been updated or re-evaluated to take into account the changes in house prices since  either, prompting calls for it to be replaced.LVT would see a yearly charge based on the value of the land property sits on ndash reflecting the current value of homes. Businesses would pay an annual tax based on the value of business premises, including the land, instead of business rates.Report authors have called for a switch from the current council tax model to be seriously considered, but admit even getting the suggestions discussed \"has been extraordinarily dficult, with well-researched and argued proposals unable to proceed from the reporting stage to due consideration by political parties and civic society\".They explained: \"The introduction of a Land Value tax is extremely radical and could not be introduced suddenly. In planning its introduction consideration would be needed to be given to those impacted by it. For example, there are some elderly people who do not want to leave their homes, and who find themselves to be asset-rich, but with insufficient income ... A thorough analysis should be carried out and discussed widely before it is introduced.\"Nonetheless ... this is a goal which is worth pursuing.\"Wipe out debtAlthough one of the least likely ideas to be taken on board by Westminster, this idea could have the biggest effect on council finances.Around poundbn a year ndash half of all council tax collected ndash is spent simply on paying interest on loans from banks and for PFI contracts, so clearing the debts could save local authorities billions. The cash saved could then be used investing in local services again.Unisons report explains: \"Trade unions should explore how local authority debts and PFI PPP contracts can be taken over by the Treasury, saving local government many billions in interest charges each year and so releasing tax revenues for investment in local economies and communities.\"Around the millennium there was evidence that investors in the City would have been willing to lend long-term at reasonably low rates of interest. Those days are now well gone, and many local authorities are facing extremely expensive debt burdens, with lsquoLender Option, Borrower Optionrsquobank loans especially problematic.\"While finance institutions may be willing to lend the costs of borrowing from them do not offer a sustainable and reasonable source of funding.\"Increasing tax for second homes, holiday homes and property owned by non-Scottish residentsThe most recent Scottish Government budget includes putting up the amount of tax people pay on second homes and buy-to-lets by %, from  to %. These plans have been welcomed by economists in Unisons report, but authors say that this could go further, with careful analysis on the impact it could have on renters. They suggest: \"Obviously, this rate could be increased further with modelling and analysis needed to ensure that rents are not increased to the detriment of tenants.\"Taxes on property which is owned by people who do not live in Scotland, and therefore do not pay income tax here, should be extended to local authorities, allowing them to collect these fees.The report authors explain: \"Extending the tax base for local authorities to include all heritable property may be worth pursuing, by first checking that this would be legislatively competent ... This is an avenue worth exploring as it would target those who are able to benefit from property ownership in Scotland but not contribute according to their wealth.\"Crack down on tax avoidersMore staff should be brought in to councils, government and agencies to help catch those exploiting loopholes in the system or simply not paying what they should in taxes.According to HMRC, around pound.bn is lost across the UK every year by tax evasion or tax avoidance. Unisons report argues that more staff need to be employed to track down people not paying their share, explaining: \"In the short term, the Scottish Government, Cosla, local government and professional bodies can work together to identy where loopholes, avoidance and coverage has allowed some to escape making their fair contribution to the collection of tax revenues.\"It adds: \"Recruitment of additional staff to ensure that registration, regulation and collection of revenues is undertaken could be achieved cost-effectively so adding to total funds.\"Bring services back under public ownershipLothian Buses are the prime example, according to Unisons report, of how public transport can work for everyonetaken under council ownership. The firm, run by four councils, had a surplus of poundmillion last year and Edinburghs transport has been ranked some of the best in the world. Outside London, bus use across the UK has fallen by more than % since , with fares rising % above inflation, except in areas where local authorities have retained their bus services and run them themselves.In England, councils have been banned from operating their own bus services, and in Scotland a change in legislation would be needed to allow it to happen in local authorities. The report states: \"While it would take a change in legislation in Scotland for local authorities who did not manage to retain ownership to operate buses again, it would appear that this could be a viable source of revenue for local government.\"Furthermore,buses were again operated by local authorities then tax payers would be relieved of the current high levels of subsidy paid to, often overseas state-owned, enterprises who currently run much of our transport infrastructure.\"They also propose introducing a not-for-profit public energy firm, similar to that run by Nottingham City Council which launched in  and has , customers. Last year the scheme had a surplus of pound, which will be reinvested on expansion and bring down costs.Scrap tax relief schemes not fit for purposeDespite no need to change legislation, amending or scrapping the small business bonus schemehas faced \"political challenges\" according to Unisons report. Authors are critical of politicians \"adopting short-term soundbites rather than constructive dialogue\" on how best to fix the problems. The SBBS costs the Scottish Government more than poundmillion a year, but is described as \"deadweight\" cash, with the economic benefits \"exaggerated and unfounded\". Non Domestic Rates have also been described as in need of review, and costs around poundm a year, according to Unisons report.Finally, tax-free schemes for independent schools, charities and sports clubs should be made on a discretionary basis depending on what they contribute to the community around them, according to the report.It explains: \"Some of the particular tax reliefs, for example, independent schools and sports clubs, would be better considered locally where the health and social care partnerships and secondary education are also focused.\""},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-letters-what-readers-are-saying-this-week","story":"The abuse that Nicola Gilchrist, the chair of Scottish Womens Aid, has received is disgusting and should be addressed robustly by Police Scotland Rangers domestic abuse TV comment, Herald on Sunday, March . Her specic mentioning of Rangers was unfortunate but she has explained why that team was in her mindand that should be the end of it.Domestic abuse is a scourge on Scottish society, causing untold misery to those adults who are targeted as well as to their family members.

Ms Gilchristrsquos slip should not distract anyone from these facts.I have argued that feminist-inspired approaches to domestic abuse, including the recognition of ldquocoercive control as a key element, are to be welcomed Scotland, AMIS , but the implications of this move have perhaps not been thought through.In recent years the number of incidents of domestic abuse reported to Police Scotland each year has been around ,but , as Ms Gilchrist is reported to have said, domestic abuse was not about \"a black eye after [a football team] lose nor something\" then a number of these reports will have to be reclassied.It may be that saying ldquodomestic abuse is not about a black eye will have a chilling effect on those seeking to report domestic abuse or on those such as frontline medical staff who are urged to be alert to the possibility of their clients experiencing domestic abuse.Brian DempseyLecturer, University of DundeeIndyref - this is indeed not the right timeYou rightly urge the First Minister to resist the temptation to exploit Brexit turmoil for the pursuit of a second independence referendum .Many on the pro-independence side of Scotlandrsquos big debate argue the case for a rerun based on the mandate provided by ious votes, and the trigger of the Brexit result. Yet after the last few years of such uncertainty, surely Scotland deserves some time to allow the dust to settle and to reflect after the  Holyrood elections. If the SNP secure a clear majority based on a manesto centred on the pursuit of independence then they will have strengthened the case to put to the UK government. Alternatively,pro-UK parties have a collective majority then that updated will of the people will avoid the need for a further isive referendum.For the SNP to push ahead now will simply be interpreted by many as primarily an attempt to stir more grievance from the inevitable rejection by a UK government still embroiled in all the implications of Brexit.Keith HowellWest LintonIt looks like Nicola Sturgeonrsquos speech writers are in for a tough time at the forthcoming SNP conference.Of course theyll be able to fudge over - at least well enough for the SNP faithful - Ms Sturgeons failure to address the educational attainment gap, her apparent inability to reduce NHS waiting times and that Scot Rail lets down commuters on a daily basis across Scotland.But where the SNP leaders spin-doctors will struggle is Brexit. Conference after conference, she turns up to tell delegates Brexit equals independence - but she doesnt deliver. Shes been teasing dyed-in-the-wool separatists with another indyref announcement for months.Its not Ms Sturgeons fault Brexit is going slowly but many in the SNP establishment grow impatient, requiring her to demand indyref now - some even favour a Catalan style referendum.But the cautious SNP leader wants to play it by the book and wont risk an unofficial referendum - and the EU has now granted a six month delay to Brexit, with still no one knowing what form Brexit will take.So Downing St will inevitably continue to reject any renewed indyref demands until, very likely, after the next Holyrood election in . Good luck to Ms Sturgeons spin-doctor team trying to get a y standing ovation out of that message.Martin RedfernEdinburghAlexander McKay suggests \"a complete realignment of British politics\" and proposes \"a new three or perhaps four party system where the views of the voters are reflected properly\" .I can only assume that he is referring to the system that has been used by the Scottish Parliament for almost  years, which does properly reflect the views of the voters and incidentally, where the SNP is in its historic third successive term of government.Ruth Marr,StirlingLaw change is the right thing to doThe news last week that a small cross-party group of MSPrsquos remain opposed to attempts to legalise assisted suicide is disappointing. Just how unrepresentative this position is, when compared to that of their constituents, can be shown by the Populus survey, where nine out of  Scots support legalising assisted dying.The groundless claim that it would have ldquoa damaging effect on society in Scotland ignores the experience from other parts of the world, including the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium and Luxembourg. Their laws permit assistance to be made available,requested, to those in need. What evidence can the MSPs provide that civilisation in these countries has been wounded as a result of such compassionate legislation MSPs at Holyrood must change the law on assisted dying, but not because that would bring us into line with other civilised societies. They should do so because it would be the right thing to do.Dr Bob Scott DrymenA nit Im delighted to pickBeing a man of a certain age, the only pleasure I have left in le is nit-picking.

Even financial watchdog Audit Scotland last year acknowledged the reduction in funding for councils as a problem.What is worth noting is that solving the issue cannot simply be hinged on bumping up taxes for those earning the most. Everyone must take responsibility and acknowledge they may have to do more on less, pay more, wait a bit longer or do without until councils can get back on their feet.Taxing residents can only go so far to solve local authorities issues, and, whether you agree with them or not, the ideas offered up in this report should be the starting point for serious discussion on how we fix council funding troubles."},{"url":null,"title":"a96 project to consider impact of new awpr","story":"Two north east politicians have highlighted the need for the A dualling process to take into account the impact of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.Current infrastructure plans for dualling the A past Inverurie to Huntly are in place, and a selection of route options are being analysed.During During Portfolio Questions at Holyrood on Thursday, April , Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin requested information on how the impact of the AWPR and the projected impact of dualling the railway line between Inverurie and Dyce, as well as the building of a new station at Kintore, is being analysed and taken into account as part of this process.Commenting, Gillian Martin MSP said: “The feedback on the AWPR to date has been extremely promising and I’m glad to hear that its impact, as well as that of other infrastructure projects in the area, will be taken into account as part of the design for the A dualling programme.“The dualling of the A is one of the next phases in transforming our infrastructure and it’s great to see increasing SNP investment in the North-East.“This is a long-awaited project which promises huge potential for the region and I look forward to its continuing development.”Meanwhile north east MSP Lewis Macdonald called on ministers to reconsider the shortlisted route options for dualling the A at Inverurie, to take into account up-to-date traffic data.Following a period of settling down of traffic behaviour, a traffic data collection exercise will be undertaken by Transport Scotland and a comparison made between the forecast and actual performance of the project.The Online Inverurie or OLI option for dualling the existing A on the edge of the town was ruled out by Transport Scotland last year.Lewis Macdonald, speaking after quizzing Transport Secretary Michael Matheson at Holyrood, said: “Taking the Online Inverurie option off the table at this early stage is not only premature, but it is based on data which is seriously out of date.“I met Michael Matheson last month, to argue that Online Inverurie should be on the shortlist of possible ways of upgrading the A. I told him how strongly many local people felt about this, because of the impact of building a whole new road north and east of the town.“He revealed that Transport Scotland has no intention of looking again at the A options, despite the fact that they have made their case on the basis of completely out-of-date information.“Road users from Inverurie and further west know full well that the AWPR has had a major impact on the A at Inverurie, which only strengthens the case for upgrading that specic stretch of existing road.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Connie Sorrie with the award and the Greengrocer family team\"  National award for family firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Ministers must listen to local people on this issue, and base any decisions on up-to-date traffic data.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project is the latest in the county to be given funding by Sustrans Scotland, the aims of which is to encourage walking, cycling and wheeling, thereby boosting the public#s health and safety.Councillor Graham Sinclair is chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee. He said: “The Development and Infrastructure Committee recently approved a World Heritage Site Masterplan document in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and also agreed to undertake a feasibility study to look at active and sustainable travel options in the World Heritage Site.#This consultation will kickstart some of that work and it’s an important opportunity for the local community to get involved. By investing in walking and cycling we can not only stimulate local economic development in our rural areas but also support positive benefits for public health and wellbeing. Active travel is an important means of building physical activity into our daily routines, also improving air quality and mental health — and this plan is the first step towards that.”The council#s public consultation drop-in event will be held on Thursday, April , .pm to .pm at Stenness Community Centre.An online consultation questionnaire for the consultation is also available here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Hit the Brexit snooze button. Lived to fight another day. But let’s get real. The new deadline of Halloweendoes not solve very much. The extra time is no panacea. If anything, it’s allowed everyone a foolish and dangerous sigh of relief. It’s back to business as usual.We heard the same tired old soundbites from both sides in the House of Commons chamber and MPs have been rewarded by being gted back their Easter recess. If you want to avoid Brexit, avoid the Canary Islands for the next few weeks. This extra time off is problematic. It’s not long enough to do anything radical and is only going to make everyone double down on their entrenched positions. May is still trying to push the deal which no one wants. Cross-party talks are now a charade. She won’t move her red lines and why would Corbyn rescue her now, when the Tory party is at breaking point and the polls have finally offered him some comfort : Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon leads calls for People’s Vote during extensionThe Tory MPs of the ERG are thinking strategically for the first time in history and will focus on making May history as soon as possible so their mancan get cracking. Supporters of a People’s Vote are happy as they think a delay increases its chances. And the European elections have raised a weird cheer at both ends of the Brexit spectrum – although they could get nasty. Hard Brexiteers hope that a Farage pro-Brexit surge will scare the bejesus out of the Tory party and pave the way for their hardline Eurosceptic God. And the ‘revoke article ’ brigade want to use the elections to make the big, bold, unashamed positive case for the European Union, which they feel wasn’t made during the  EU referendum.They are excited. I know people who swore they were done with politics who are now busy applying to be MEP candidates.It will also, of course, give The Independent Group or Centre UKas well as the smaller pro-Europe parties a big opportunity to seethey can make an electoral splash.: Brexit: David Mundell says Tories could back customs union in talks with LabourThe particular choreography of the latest delay also provides the SNP with an opportunity which is already proving irresistible.Sturgeon has been careful not to use Brexit to pivot into Indyref but it is fascinating that she is now making the argument that countries with populations similar to or less than Scotland’s were lording it over the UK. “If we become independent, we get to sit at that table enjoying the same solidarity shown to Ireland – instead of being sidelined by Westminster.” This is double edged. She knows her SNP supporters will love it, but is smart enough to clock that many folk will translate the chaos of Brexit into Scotland breaking away and feel terror. She has said she will reflect over the Easter recess and make a statement, but she should be careful. She has won plaudits for her leadership on Brexit but that could changeit looks like she’s weaponising it for her own project.For now, this second extension is an Easter gt to all sides.

Another unhappy figure will be Michel Barnier, rumoured to want the Commission presidency – he argued for a short extension.There may time for a People’s VoteA six-month delay is less than Remainers hoped for, but there is just enough time to hold a second EU referendum.

Conservative Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg does a dependable line in being quaintly courteous during his frequent interventions on the vexing issue of Brexit, so when he lost his temper last week and threw a tantrum over the prospect of further delays to the UK’s departure from the EU, he revealed a side of him we don’t usually see.It was not a pleasant spectacle.If a Brexit delay meant the UK being – thanks to the need for us to participate in May’s European elections – “stuck” in the EU, then it would be incumbent on our representatives in Strasbourg to be “as dficult as possible”. Rees-Mogg suggested such wheezes as a veto on any increase in EU budgets, the obstruction of any moves towards the creation of an EU army and a block on what he described as French president Emmanuel Macron’s “integrationist schemes”. As is the norm with a frustrated hard-Brexiteer, Rees-Mogg lashes out at others when things don’t go his way. The frightfully polite gentleman schtick evaporates and the teeth are bared beneath that stf upper lip.Pro-Brexit politicians and campaigners would, it seems, never dream of asking themselves whether they might bear any personal responsibility for the situation in which the nation now finds itself.They campaigned in the  referendum on the promisesthat the NHS would prosper and the rest of the world would beat down the UK’s door to lavish us with trade deals.They told us that departure from the EU would be straightforward and painless, predicting negotiations carried through on a warm pillow of bonhomie. And they told us the country would unite behind its new “independent status”.Cynically deflecting every legitimate question as part of a Project Fear strategy, Brexiteers double down on their claims. The problem with anyone who dared to suggest that Brexit mightn’t usher in a new era of British prosperity was that they just didn’t believe.Meaningless stuff, of course. A crisis is a crisis no matter what one believes.Rees-Mogg’s fellow travellers on the Hard Brexit right now say that democracy has been betrayed by the failure of the UK to have left the EU on schedule. The current delay – which looks likely to be extended – and the prospect of the UK having then to participate in May’s European elections has pushed some already furiously angry people closer to the edge. Phasers have been set to maximum outrage.“Forgive them father for they know not what they do,” said Mark Francois, the puffed-up little red-faced Tory MP who’s begun appearing on TV every day in order, it would appear, to display the many and ied ways in which he is a buffoon. We were dangerously close to “Jesus would have voted Leave” territory here. But that’s the hysterical crank-right for you.Rees-Mogg, Francois, the whole whining lot of them, are not the victims of others out to get them. They have not fallen foul of a sinister EU plot or been thwarted by a conspiracy against democracy. The truth is that they and all of the other snake oil salesmen who punted a painless Brexit have been caught out by their own lies. It is as simple as that.During the  campaign, these politicians – and other scoundrels like Boris Johnson – steered away from facts and depended on the emotional response of voters. It was all Take Back Control! and promises of endless sunlit uplands.Nobody who campaigned to Remain is responsible for the fact Leavers relied on unicorn-land fantasies of prosperity to make their case.Brexiteers sneered at the suggestion the EU might not give the UK everything it demanded during departure negotiations. We held so many cards, they said, that our European neighbours would do whatever it took to secure a deal.Now that we know for a fact that the EU has negotiated with the best interests of the EU in mind – fancy that –Brexiteers complain that the UK should have been more forceful.In the fevered fantasies of your Mark Francoises, a Brexiteering hard-man should have walked into those negotiations, slammed his fist on the table and told the whole damned lot of ’em how things were going to be.Rees-Mogg and his cronies in the European Research Group tell us a story of a United Kingdom forced to bend the knee by Europe. In their fantasy, a once-proud Britain is dictated to by the EU. Stripped of influence and power, Britannia has been brought to her knees by unrelated mandarins with their spiteful diktats.Yet, the Rees-Mogg strop suggests to me he knows full well the tale of British subjugation is nonsense. If the UK could go ahead and cause the chaos he wishes to see, doesn’t that rather suggest we have a great deal more influence in the European Union than Brexiteers would like us to think As they get angrier, Brexiteers’ language becomes more dangerous. We’ve heard the accusations of betrayal and treachery, we’ve seen the way some MPs have been singled out for protests by mobs who buy into the lie that the chaos of Brexit represents nothing less than contempt for democracy.This is ugly stuff and I fear things may get much worse.If they do, then those who promised a Brexit that appears – as the nation was frequently warned – to be undeliverable will, I am sure, wring their hands and complain about elites and their contempt for voters. But they cannot continue to outrun their culpability for where we now find ourselves – a bitterly ided Britain that’s become an international laughing stock.Leave campaigners lied and swaggered their way through the  referendum and reality has bitten them, hard. They – and they alone – must take responsibility for the chaos engulfing the Brexit process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2 currency union plan was disastrous says 2014 campaign chief canavan","story":"The head of the  Scottish independence campaign says its currency policy was \"disastrous\" and left it a \"hostage to fortune\" when the UK Government refused to back it.Dennis Canavan has admitted the currency union proposal effectively left Westminster with a \"veto\" over the plan.

The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe .

If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory.

I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go.

The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dancing dentists scoop title","story":"A group of dancing dentists have secured a prestigious prize after their fundraising efforts raised #, for charity.Colleagues from the Bupa Dental Care Banbridge practice came together to waltz, tango, salsa and foxtrot, raising money for their long-standing charity partner, Make-A-Wish, which creates le-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses.In total, the charity event saw  couples hit the dancefloor to compete for success in front of a crowd of more than  people.

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age. Anyone who is not surethey are fully-vaccinated should check with their GP practice. If you haven’t had your kids vaccinated, contact your GP surgery to make arrangement for them to get the MMR and help to provide them and those around them with the best protection.”The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperaturea cough.To view the video see www.pha.site MMRvimeoFor more information on measles, mumps and rubella see www.pha.site mmr.PHA programme to tackle type  diabetes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pha programme to tackle type 2 diabetes","story":"A new programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes has been launched by the Public Health Agency.

Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme.

Music and lyrics in the production are by Eurythmics legend Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, who co-wrote and produced Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, so I was looking really forward to hearing how they were going to move the story and action along.The production begins with idealistic couple Sam Wheat, played by Irish actor Niall Sheehy, and Rebekah Lowing in the role of Molly Jensen, a banker and an artist, just starting out on le after buying their first apartment together. Their lives are ripped apart after a mugging goes horribly wrong and Sam is shot dead leaving him ‘between’ here and the afterle. It is his need to protect Molly that drives him to not be welcomed by St Peter at the gates but to try find out what happened.The staging of the production is excellent, whether it’s capturing the New York skyline, taking us into the bowels of the city’s subway or to ‘psychic’ Oda Mae Brown’s palmistry studio just off the beaten track where Sam meets his ally – and a way to get answers.With such a tragic story, comic relief thankfully comes in spades with the introduction of Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae, a character brought so brilliantly to le when Whoopi Goldberg did the job onscreen. Jacqui and Niall work brilliantly together and her outlandish outfits are a sight to behold as she belts out ‘Are You a Believer’ to the sad souls coming through her door hoping for a connection to a loved one who has passed on. The use of theatrical trickery is extremely clever, especially when conveying the moment Sam is murdered and immediately becomes a ‘ghost’ or when trying to access a door or move pieces of furniture.A special mention must go to Sergio Pasquariello in his role as the couple’s shady friend Carl, who it becomes clear is in way over his head at the bank, and Jules Brown in his role as murderer Willie Lopez. Both bring menace to the stage and the message is that all is not what it seems no matter how much you think you know a person. Lovonne Zeus Richards is excellent in his role as the Subway Ghost who helps Sam realise how to use his death to his advantage in his quest for retribution.The finale is beautully staged as Sam and Molly get to – and have to – say their final goodbyes and we hear a stirring rendition from Niall Sheehy of The Righteous Brothers’ Unchained Melody – and it’s fair to say there was a bit of snuffling and snfling among the audience.Initially thought unstageable, Ghost The Musical really does work and with tickets limited throughout its week run it’s best to get them quick.Ghost The Musical runs at the Grand Opera House until Saturday April .

At the end of the current season, Sport and Leisure Swts will cease to exist and the club will change their name to Belfast Celtic. Sport and Leisure are locked in a relegation battle in the Bluefin Premier Intermediate League – the third tier of the Irish League. Relegation could see them move into the Ballymena and Provincial League, where fellow West Belfast sides St James’ Swts and Donegal Celtic currently play. However, in a surprise move, Belfast Media Group understands that the club is actively pursuing their options for next season which could see them apply for affiliation to the SSE Airtricity League . Sport and Leisure Swts are affiliated to the Irish Football Association and it was believed the new Belfast Celtic entity would simply take their place. Yet, the committee at Glen Road Heights are exploring their options with Belfast Celtic apparently free to join a dferent league.Clubs seeking to switch leagues would usually require permission from both bodies and it would be unlikely that the IFA would grant such a move. However, a club source expressed their view that the club could force a switch under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In any case, they may not need legal assistance as, strictly speaking, a new club under the name of Belfast Celtic will be formed next month when Sport and Leisure Swts ceases to exist. It is understood that the committee have already held preliminary talks with League of Ireland officials who would welcome a new member as long as the switch received the backing of the IFA. SSE Airtricity Premier Division side Derry City started off in the Irish League, winning the title in . Issues surrounding security during The Troubles forced them to play their home games in Coleraine before they dropped out of the Irish League. Following a number of years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland in . Belfast Celtic would be an interesting addition to the League of Ireland should they go down that route. Following a long and protracted saga, Sport and Leisure had their application to change their name to Belfast Celtic approved by the board of the IFA last December having consulted with the Northern Ireland Football League, the Co Antrim FA and the Belfast Celtic Society.Sport and Leisure have endured a dficult campaign have find themselves at the foot of the table with just five games remaining. They have three games in hand over second from bottom Armagh City and the sides clash at Holm Park on Saturday afternoon. Packie McAllister’s men also face two games with Portstewart in the coming weeks.Sport and Leisure’s struggles this season have been exacerbated following a host of suspensions handed out to key players in the wake of their abandoned tie with Portstewart in January. Padraig Lynch and Stephen McAlorum are among those set toto action for Saturday’s crucial trip to Armagh, but goalkeeper Michael Magill remains suspended. McAllister’s men gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation after they battled back from three goals down to claim a vital point against Dollingtown last Saturday at Glen Road Heights.An own goal from Gavin Johnston and a double from Dollingstown’s Keith Johnston seemed to gave sealed the points for the visitors and the Swts suffered a further blow when midfielder Pierce Tully was dismissed. However, they mounted a rousing comeback in the final half hour and goals from Liam Carland, Ronan Carroll and substitute Ciaran McKissock levelled the game at -. Dollingstown were also reduced to  men when Richard Thompson was shown a red card in the closing stages.With Armagh suffering a - defeat to Moyola last Saturday, this weekend’s showdown with Sport and Leisure in Holm Park will go a long to deciding which side finishes bottom of the Premier Intermediate League. It just might not decide which league the West Belfast outfit will be playing in next season when they become Belfast Celtic."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local man loses out on internship over brexit","story":"A Lisburn man has spoken of how he has lost out on a prestigious European internship due to the implications of Brexit.-year-old Ruairí Fisher had successfully applied for an internship with the Scout Movement in Brussels, but was later rejected on the basis that he lives in the North of Ireland, which would be outside the EU in the event of Brexit.Despite Irish citizenship and membership of the all-Ireland Scouting Organisation, a spokesperson for the Scouts told Mr Fisher in an email correspondance that the “benchmark” for EU funding is “current residency” not “citizenship”.“Unless you get an Irish residence for the next six months, you would not be eligible,” the spokesperson added.Speaking to Daily Belfast, Mr Fisher said: “I was annoyed and disappointed that through no fault of my own I was rejected from the internship.“It seems that the people in Westminster and Europe don’t understand the terms of the Good Friday Agreement or the implications of Brexit on it. “I’m an Irish citizen, but because I live in a contested space my opportunities are jeopardized. Even though the terms of the Good Friday Agreement allow me to claim Irish citizenship, EU residency seems to be a sticking point for them.”He continued: “I think it raises questions about the wider impact of Brexit on people here.

I was good being over there and playing for Warwickshire,” said McKenna.“At the same time, I wanted to be back home. It was hard watching Sarsfield’s playing when I came back knowing I couldn’t play Championship. It was hard to take. Our aim has to be to try and have a year like we had two years ago.“I think we should have a good shout. The Intermediategrade looks tough this year, but with the squad we have we should be capable of going well again.”On the football front, Sarsfield’s face neighbours Rossa at the Bear Pit tonightwith both teams bidding to build on their opening victories.Sarsfield’s defeated St Pat’s Lisburn by four points in round one in a repeat of the  JFC final while Rossa laid down a serious marker by defeating Aldergrove - to - in their Division Two opener, so McKenna is expecting a tough battle this evening.“This will be the hardest game we have in the ision,” said McKenna.“We have to play as well as we can and just worry about ourselves and don’t think too much about Rossa.“No matter who we play, we would fancy our chances at home so we have to play to the best of our ability and see where it takes us.“We had a good win over St Pat’s in our first game so we have to try and build that from.”Rossa manager Sean Fleming, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction with their emphatic win over Aldergrove, but stressed that they will have plenty of competition for promotion this season.“ We were very pleased with it because when both teams were in Division One it was always a one-point game between us. It was good to start the season off with a win against a decent team,” said Fleming.“We hoped to make a quick escape from Division Two the last time we were in it and it didn’t happen for seven or eight years.“Just because you’ve dropped down from Division One doesn’t give you a right to think you’ll go straight back up. You’ve a lot of good quality teams in the ision and they want the same thing we do.”Fleming, like McKenna, is anticipating a close contest when Rossa and Sarsfield’s clash this evening.“It wouldn’t matterone of the teams were in Division One and the other were in Division Three, it is going to be a very close game,” added the Rossa boss, who is sweating on the fitness of Michael Armstrong, Richard Gowdy and Thomas Morgan.“This group of lads from both teams have grown up with each other. They would have faced each other at U, U and at minor and they were always very close games.“Sarsfield’s always play a good brand of strong, physical, competitive football.

Talking to the Andersonstown News, she said: “We are here on a study trip to educate ourselves but we have been given the chance to come to and see how a school like this works. It has been very interesting.”“We have seen some subjects here we would love to introduce into our school. Home Economics and Photography, we don’t have. These really specialised subjects would be lovely for us to have. It was also very interesting to hear about the school, the area it’s in and the high performance they achieve.”Stressing the educational value of the trip, Ms Bentvelzen lauded the staff, students and facilities. “The children are really lovely. We’ve been in several classes but we have not been teaching, because we are from a completely dferent school.“We’ve just been observing in class, listening in, and the teacher explains to us what they#re doing. I talked to one of the students in a Home Economics class while she was cooking and she was enjoying herself and she mentioned something interesting. She told me, ‘Ive been away for a while and I’ve realised I can’t miss classes too much because you miss so much.’ It’s lovely to hear that from students.”“Being in this school is very dferent for a lot of us. We have already been to a number of other schools, we’ve got some young colleagues with us and they haven’t seen this before, so it’s an eye opener, how dferent the education system is over here.”Principal Adrian Walsh echoed these sentiments, stating that the staff and pupils were “delighted” to showcase their facilities and school ethos to their visitors.“They came to us through InterEducation, who askedwe were willing to host a party of teachers from Holland as they were trying to improve English as a foreign language in their own setting.“We felt it was a fantastic opportunity for them to come and see what we do.

The next morning Aaron noticed something in the corner of the room.“He’d be pretty high-tech so he called me and said ‘have a look at that’. It was a camera.“Then we started looking all over the house. There were cameras everywhere, even in the toilet. It was a big bathroom with a hot tub and a sauna.“There was a motion sensor camera in the corner watching everything, in the corners of the bedroom as well.“There wasn’t one room in that house that didn’t have a camera.“We called a meeting at the pool area and discussed what we were going to do because we didn’t know what we were dealing with.“We knew we needed to get out of this house. He would have been watching us and saw us taking photos of his cameras.“We just left as quickly as we could.”A spokesman for Airbnb said that it took immediate action against the homeowner and suspended his account.“We take privacy issues extremely seriously. As soon as we were made aware we removed this host from our  and fully refunded the guests,” a spokesman said.“We have strict standards governing surveillance devices in listings and take reports of any violations very seriously.“There have been more than half a billion guest arrivals on Airbnb to date and issues are incredibly rare.” data-dfpadtargetingThe Conroys holiday apartment.The family had spent just one night in the villa before they found the cameras, and had to organise accommodation for the remaining five nights.However, although Airbnb refunded them the money for the villa, the family said there was no compensation over the incident and they struggled to find accommodation that was of similar standard to the villa.“We went down to my sister’s place and rang Airbnb. The customer service really was appalling, really terrible,” Ms Conroy said.“I rang the police in Greece. They said there was nothing they could dowe stayed in the property they said maybe they could have. They just didn’t want to know.”The family forked out for a hotel which cost signicantly more as it was last-minute.They said that Airbnb should take some responsibility and look into its homeowners.“I looked through the reviews for the property later and saw that families with kids were staying there,” Ms Conroy said.“They were posting good reviews so obviously they didn’t even notice the cameras.”The revelations come a week after a New Zealand family revealed their horror at finding a hidden camera inside their Cork property after renting through Airbnb.Read MoreTourists in Irish Airbnb find hidden camera livestreaming from their room"},{"url":null,"title":"princess anne tours lighthouses on visit to dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now this delay has wrecked our plans,” Mr Coyle said.“We have to sell off all the stuff that we had stockpiled and we have to stockpile again for October, but my worry is that Brexit can happen at any time. “It can happen in June when they review it, so how do I prepare  How do I manage that “The politicians are not helping the likes of me to prepare when they can’t even give us a date. Will October be the actual date, or will it be pushed down the road again ”Mr Coyle said he and other businesses in the Republic were taking no chances when it came to products manufactured in the UK and had filled warehouses with essentials to avoid empty shelves.“The items I have stockpiled are items that we can’t guarantee we will have on the shelvesa no-deal Brexit happens,” Mr Coyle explained. “Anything that is produced in Great Britain is stuff we have stockpiled. “That would be biscuits such as custard creams, which are manufactured in the Great Britain and brought across, and brands like Heinz.“Custard creams are very telling because they are something that only sell very well in the British Isles — Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. They are only made in Manchester and a few factories in Great Britain. It’s not something where you can ring up France and ask them to send you a few containers of custard creams — they don’t make them anywhere . “You either have them in from your Great Britain factory, or you don’t have them at all.“I would have several pallets of custard creams and Bourbon creams stockpiled already. That would be almost , biscuits. “They all have a sell-by date, which is before October, and now I have to stop buying them from my supplier and sell what I have stockpiled. “That all has implications for the supply chain behind me.“Another thing we have been stockpiling is garlic bread. There is one factory in the North that makes all the garlic bread for the entire island of Ireland. “If there is a hard border and the customs go in and there are controls and lockdown on the border, all of a sudden the  counties are going to have dficulty sourcing fresh garlic bread. They will have to get it from France or find some other way.“Because the garlic bread is fresh, the day we can’t get it is the day we can’t get it. “We have had to compensate by stockpiling frozen garlic bread. We would have several hundred frozen garlic breads stored in our warehouse in Galway.“Now I have to be prepared to stockpile and buy it all in again for October. We don’t know the future and that is very dficult for us.”Mr Coyle hopes the UK will not leave the EU at all, but he feels that the current situation has left everyone “in limbo”.“I can see a lot of wrong things in Europe, but I certainly don’t want to leave it,” he said. “If there is anything that needs fixed, we will fix it from the inside.“With what has happened now, we are all completely in limbo. “You have all these guys getting paid thousands of pounds a week to sort it out, running around in suits trying to sort it out — and they need to sort it out. “I would hate to see the UK leave the EU, butthey are going, well then, go. At least then we would have some sort of clarity and would know what is happening.”"},{"url":null,"title":"candidate urges public take part prehen boathouse consultation","story":"An independent candidate in next months local election has urged the public to have their say on the future of Prehen Boathouse.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPaul Hughes said: \"I would urge everyone with an interest in the future of Prehen Boat House to take a few minutes to complete the online survey at http:www.derrystrabane prehenboathouse before Thursday th April .\"This online survey further provides an opportunity for people to outline to council their views regarding the future development of the boathouse.\"The redevelopment of Prehen Boathouse is long over due.

We are a small school and have been in danger of this for many years.“With everything going on politically at the moment, and money drying up everywhere and Brexit, I’m not surprised they would come after a small school now.“I am absolutely devastated though and won’t know how to tell my childrenthis goes forward. They call it ‘The Little School with a Big Heart’ for a reason.”Some parents have decided to await the outcome before telling their children, but Mrs McLaughlin gave assurances that they won’t allow the school to close without a fight.“I think a lot are waiting to see what happens. I’m fairly certain the parents here will give a good fight...we feel very passionately about it,” she explained.“The relationships the children have with each other and the teachers are so important. Not to mention the solid academics with such a small ratio. My son has gone strength to strength.“I don’t know anywhere  we could have such a lovely educations for our children.”The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell.  Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and .The school has been a part of the local community for over  years.  It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs part of a pre-publication consultation, the Education Authority is currently seeking any objections or comments on the proposed discontinuance of Groarty CIPS from the Board of Governors, parents and staff of Groarty CIPS and Trustees, and other interested parties in the local community.The consultation document makes reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S.It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daróige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places.The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school.Joint campusThe EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education.  And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daróige.Both schools made a joint submission under the Shared Education CampusesProgramme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.”At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.In justication of its proposed closure of Groarty CIPS, the EA said it believes other schools in the area can cater for the children’s educational needs and home-to-school transport will “mitigate against this impact” and provide for the safe transportation of pupils from the area to their nearest school.Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still not up and running, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The closing date for the consultation process is June  and for those who want to have their say, you can visit: www.eani.org.uk prepublication-consultations groarty-ips"},{"url":null,"title":"richard bolitho derry born dam buster commemorated city cemetery","story":"CAPTION: Derry born Richard Bolitho is pictured on the far right.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

With just a tenth of a second separating him from top spot, he carried plenty of momentum into qualying the following day with the JTR team.After dealing with a treacherous first few laps, it became clear it was the right decision and Harper took full advantage.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues.

They have bought the whole estate so that they can control everything that happens and they are anxious that nothing is ruined or destroyed.

Less than a fortnight ago, he was the proud recipient of a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Civic Award.In the run-up to Motherrsquos Day, he raised a whopping pound, for two childrenrsquos charities with his treats and tray-bakes, which were sold from an honesty box at the bottom of the driveway at his house.The money, which includes over pound which he earned from his specially created Tfany-styled, bow-wrapped Motherrsquos Day mini-hampers, will be shared between the Childrenrsquos Heart Beat Clinic and the Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos facility at Daisy Lodge in Newcastle.Mum Hazel described the Friday before Motherrsquos Day as a ldquomarathon baking day in which she and Ryan prepared shortbread caramel brownies and chocolate Rice Krispie buns and Fteens made with Turkish Delights.ldquoThey were all sold in a matter of hours, she said. ldquoWe work together because there is such a demand.ldquoAll you do is stop the car, select what you want from the honesty box which stands at the bottom of our drive and leave the appropriate money.ldquoWe have found the community here is swimming with good will and generosity.

I did not support the college. I was not positive enough.”He added: “I gave my personal view and I’ve been charged with setting myself up as the only enlightened person and that did not go down well with – I believe – a right wing management.”He said he would be making an appeal against his dismissal on the basis that the processes followed were not “proportionate, fair or just”.Prof Kirkpatrick said leaving the church was an option to consider, addinghe left it would be with a “heavy heart”.He said: “I feel I’m more being pushed out than deciding to leave though others would say that’s my decision. I can stay of course, but that’s like saying to gay people ‘you’re welcome to come to our church but we’ll not give you sacrements.”Prof Kirkpatrick said: “If I left I would be one of about  this week. That’s the average number of people draining away from PCI for the past  years.”He said: “I have devoted my entire working le to the Presbyterian Church... I’ve seen it grow, I’ve seen it shrink, I’ve seen the recent choppy waters that we have sailed into. It is with a heavy heart that I have felt it of late to be rather a cold place. I must say I’m saddened by the decision of the university [to dismiss him], but not surprised.”The Presbyterian Church was asked for a comment.NI woman dies after collision near her home Coremetrics

It also found that the city where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in a nerve agent attack was the best place to live in the UK overall – Salisbury.One of the judges said the Wiltshire city showed a “collective spirit” after the poisonings. Ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the Novichok attack, which Russia denies.Helen Davies, The Sunday Times Home editor, said: “Salisbury ... remains a inely attractive and welcoming place. It’s handy for coast, countryside and London, has some of the best schools in the southwest, a great market and it’s very strong culturally, too.”The Isle of Dogs was named best place to live in

the inside of one of the lighthousesHosted by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, Anne met staff and heard about their work providing vital maritime safety services and modern navigation aids at its Dun Laoghaire headquarters.She also toured the navigation vessel, ILV Granuaile during her two-day visit that began on Friday.The Princess Royal was visiting in her role as Master of Trinity House as part of the ongoing -year relationship between Irish Lights and the Lighthouse Authorities of Great Britain and Ireland.Irish Lights chief executive Yvonne Shields O’Connor said it was a “great privilege” to host the royal.“Not only have we a strong historical relationship with Trinity House and Northern Lighthouse Board, we have an essential day-to-day working relationship and warm ties of friendship,” she said.“I am honoured to have this opportunity to showcase the vital work Irish Lights does, in particular with regard to providing essential safety services through the use of modern technology in visual and electronic navigation aids, as well as our Met and Coastal Data services.“While our work is progressive and forward-focused, we are also immeasurably proud of our rich heritage and we are delighted that the Princess Royal’s visit has also included a trip to one of the very first lighthouses built by Irish Lights in , the Baily Lighthouse.“The Princess Royal is a great champion of the maritime sector and we appreciate her visit as a source of encouragement to our own work and in terms of strengthening the bonds between the three lighthouse authorities.”NI

Irsquove recently had money for junction  of the M but I donrsquot have additional fundingfor this.Rod Harrod, chairman of the Dinas Powys Bypass Steering Group, said the bypass plans are ldquomore advanced now than at any time in the last  or even  years.Mr Harrod said improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction would benefit staff, patients, and visitors at Llandough Hospital.Councillors said there could be some competition for Welsh Government funding for the bypass from the proposed works on junction  of the M.Cllr Andrew Robertson, who represents Dinas Powys, said he couldnrsquot understand why there had to be competition for funding with the M scheme.ldquoIf the traffic situation in Dinas Powys is resolved it would benefit every community across the South Wales, Vale of Glamorgan corridor, Cllr Robertson said.Cllr Gwyn John urged the campaign to keep going despite the delays.He said: ldquoI can appreciate how frustrated people involved are with the delays.ldquo[The bypass] is a must. With all the development we have got across the Vale of Glamorgan itrsquos chocka-block. Itrsquos getting worse.ldquoDonrsquot give up, get stuck in. Itrsquos going to be a battle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That anger and stoking of ision is dangerous and irresponsible.At that same rally we saw a leader of the far right who is a convicted violent racist criminal being applauded on stage.That should not make any us proud regardless of how we voted.The biggest threat to the union of the UK comes from a No Deal.It would not only destabilise politics in Northern Ireland but it would almost certainly guarantee another Scottish independence referendum.More turmoil that would not turn back the tide of austerity or add a single extra penny into our schools, the NHS or any other public service that we rely upon.I do not believe a ided UK Parliament can make a choice for the next generation of our ided countries.I was proud to sponsor two coaches and march alongside more than a million members of the public, including many people from Cardf South and Penarth calling for a Peoplersquos Vote.We need to go back to the people with a choice between a Brexit deal that Parliament can agree and our current deal within the EU.There is no simple choice to the isions that we face but I would as ever be interested to hear views from my constituents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That anger and stoking of ision is dangerous and irresponsible.At that same rally we saw a leader of the far right who is a convicted violent racist criminal being applauded on stage.That should not make any us proud regardless of how we voted.The biggest threat to the union of the UK comes from a No Deal.It would not only destabilise politics in Northern Ireland but it would almost certainly guarantee another Scottish independence referendum.More turmoil that would not turn back the tide of austerity or add a single extra penny into our schools, the NHS or any other public service that we rely upon.I do not believe a ided UK Parliament can make a choice for the next generation of our ided countries.I was proud to sponsor two coaches and march alongside more than a million members of the public, including many people from Cardf South and Penarth calling for a Peoplersquos Vote.We need to go back to the people with a choice between a Brexit deal that Parliament can agree and our current deal within the EU.There is no simple choice to the isions that we face but I would as ever be interested to hear views from my constituents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is, in many ways, a hidden corner of Penarth with a unique and special character.\"The future plans for the house will no doubt be a subject of local interest and concern, but in the meantime a number of local people have expressed interest in forming a voluntary group called \"The Friends of the Kymin Park.\"This group would aim to promote enjoyment of the park as public pleasure grounds.\"Wed also invite both councils to keep us informed of developments so that \"the friends of the Kymin Park\" could also be a source of good information about arrangements of access and enjoyment of the park during the time that the park management negotiations are resolved,\" added Mr Parry.\"Anyone interested is welcome to come to a meeting on Tuesday at .pm in Foxys Deli,  Victoria Road, Penarth to discuss the formation of a group \"The Friends of the Kymin Park\", specically focused on supporting and developing public enjoyment of the park grounds.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

England will introduce a similar bill in .A public consultation, carried out in Wales in November  and published in January , found that out of , responses,  per cent of responses were behind a ban on wild animals in circuses.But a total of , of these responses were identical, from campaign group Born Free.More than  local authorities in the UK have a ban on animals in circuses, but the Vale council is not among them. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/next2.jpg","title":"next  ni smes sees  sales surge","story":"Posted on Tuesday April  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s leading small and medium-sized businesses have seen a .% surge in sales in the last year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Next  is Ulster Business’s showcase of SMEs based across Northern Ireland, and follows directly on from the Top  Northern Ireland Companies list, ranking firms based on turnover from the latest filed accounts to Companies House.Turnover growth has surged among the businesses this year, adding up to £.bn across the , with this list of companies increasing turnover by .%, year-on-year.John Lavery of Grant Thornton, who helped analyse and compile the list, said: “The Next  is a fascinating insight into Northern Ireland business. “The list is a broad mix of household names and less well-known companies that are delivering over £bn in turnover and employment for more than , people.“These firms are the le blood of the NI economy, operating across the whole of NI and across a broad range of sectors. “The combined turnover of this group of firms is .% higher than a year previous.“This performance is all the more impressive when we think of the Northern Ireland economy as a whole, where aggregate turnover across all companies declined.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
