Banded brick walls frame stone stairwells with deep oxblood and creamy white tiles. These connect to spacious decks of homes, each identified with a numbered tile.This splendour is just what you would expect to see in the Bourne Estate in Holborn, which boasts some of the finest public tenement housing of Edwardian London. Yet these blocks are not part of the 1905, Grade II-listed estate but a recent addition built by Camden as part of its new generation of council housing. Designed by architect Matthew Lloyd, the buildings exude a quality rarely found in developer-built flats – handsome proportions and crafted details mirroring the love and care that went into the surrounding estate, only brought up-to-date with bigger windows, higher ceilings and more generous spaces.It might sound like an anomaly, but this group of 75 homes is one of many such developments now appearing across London, as local authorities have begun to build their own housing again. They are mostly doing so for the first time in four decades, since Margaret Thatcher took away their powers to build. These were only returned in 2012 and, in the seven years since, London councils have built over 2,000 homes – compared to only 70 in the seven years before that.But it’s not quite social housing as we once knew it. Given the continued lack of central government funding, councils have turned to a more entrepreneurial model, usually including a substantial number of flats for private sale to subsidise the council accommodation. Hackney recently built a pair of David Chipperfield-designed towers, the sale of which helped pay for the regeneration of the Colville estate next door. In Camden’s case, its boutique apartments are marketed as the Camden Collection, with the breathless marketing spiel you would expect from a luxury developer. At the Bourne Estate there are 31 such flats – including two-bedroom ones on sale for £1.3m – in order to fund 35 new council flats and 10 at intermediate rent, leased below market rates.“People might think it’s strange for a council to be behaving like a developer,” says councillor Danny Beales. “But with the current constraints, it’s one of the only ways of funding investment.” Beales is cabinet member for Camden’s Community Investment Programme (CIP), an ambitious 15-year plan to pump over £1bn into schools, homes and community facilities across the borough, funded in large part by the sale of flats built on public land. Exploiting the high value of its central London location – described by the Labour council as its “North Sea oil” strategy – Camden has one of the biggest house-building programmes of all, with over 3,000 homes planned, 862 of which have been completed so far, around half for social and intermediate rent.CIP aims to build on the bold architectural heritage of the borough, which saw some of the most innovative housing of the postwar era – built under council architect Sydney Cook – from Neave Brown’s work at Fleet Road and Alexandra Road to Benson and Forsyth’s Corbusian Branch Hill and Maiden Lane.There may no longer be a borough architect, but Camden has tried to put design at the forefront, holding competitions for each site and involving residents in selecting the winning architects and developing their schemes. The results are erse, ranging from Lloyd’s contemporary Edwardian tenements, to a clumsy attempt to emulate the white modernist language of Maiden Lane, by PRP architects, who have pumped up the low-rise concrete blocks to a steroidal scale.Peter Barber, king of quirky curvy rooflines, has injected a dose of fun with his Holmes Road Studios, providing housing for homeless people around an allotment garden, while Burd Haward have conducted agile urban dentistry in Gospel Oak, inserting a handful of homes into small infill sites.The biggest project of all is at Agar Grove, where a maligned 1960s estate is being overhauled by Hawkins Brown and Mae architects, in a long-term scheme that will see almost 500 new homes built to low-energy Passivhaus standards, responding to the crippling fuel poverty faced by many residents. The masterplan aims to reconfigure the site with streets and squares, introducing new routes through the currently inward-looking estate, including rows of maisonettes by Mae that take inspiration from the split-section layout of Neave Brown’s beloved Fleet Road estate.Ferdinand Daludado, who recently moved into one of the first new blocks, clad in dark purplish brick, couldn’t be more pleased with his airy flat at the top of the building, where he has transformed his big south-facing balcony into a lush hanging garden. “It is so much bigger and brighter than my previous flat on the estate,” he says. “And it only has one radiator, which I barely need to turn on in winter.”With an overall increase of 244 homes, the final tenure mix on the estate will be 216 homes for social rent, 37 at intermediate rent and 240 for private sale – which, in terms of proper council housing, represents an increase of just six homes. The council is quick to point out, however, that the flats are much bigger than those they are replacing, with the overall masterplan representing a third more social rented floor space than before. But the fact that the estate’s central tower block will be reincarnated as solely private flats is an unfortunate symbol of funding realities.“They’ve lost the plot,” says Slaney Devlin, chair of the Somers Town Neighbourhood Forum, which has vociferously opposed the plans. “It’s brilliant that the council is building more social housing elsewhere, but the social value is being missed when they’re designing segregated developments like this. It’s astonishing for a Labour council to be building a tower of investment units on a park. If this is the answer, then they’ve asked the wrong question.” The wider masterplan is centred on a new school and nursery, although it’s now uncertain if the facility is needed, given a drastic drop in pupil numbers which means a school nearby is threatened with closure. “In this case,” says Devlin, “they just got it wrong.”Paul Tomlinson, Labour councillor for the ward, has also raised alarms about what he sees as the imbalance of the CIP programme. Describing the impact as “a kind of social cleansing”, he adds: “It’s great that we’re building again, but the new developments aren’t doing enough to tackle our long social housing waiting list. A lot of our poorer residents with larger families are having to move out of the borough. And now there’s doubt about being able to sell the private flats.”Given the current lull in the property market, the council is considering renting out a number of units – originally planned for sale – at private rent rates, prompting concerns that they will lose their resale value. As the market wobbles, the commercial risks that councils are taking become apparent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50f816ab2abb32cbea40399511a6fcaec6ae812/1505_1388_1943_1166/master/1943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e563a6a63cabd780490a38c645ba2d49","title":"evgenia arbugaeva best photograph arctic childhood tiksi russia","story":"‘Tanya put on her favourite dress, wandered to the sea, and a dog started following her. There are lots of strays in Tiksi – people left their pets during the mass exodus’When the Soviet Union fell, thousands of people left small Russian Arctic towns such as Tiksi, where this photo was taken. It was my home town and I spent the first eight years of my life there, but it stopped receiving financial support and fell into neglect. In 1993, my family became part of the mass exodus.Tiksi was built on the coast of the Arctic Ocean as an outpost on the northern sea route, a port town and a military base during the cold war. When I was growing up, there was a whole secret part of town that even had its own schools where nobody was allowed to go. Tiksi was also really important in the history of Russian Arctic exploration – it’s where the icebreakers set off from. But today it’s struggling.I’d been away almost 20 years before I went back. Returning felt more like stepping into a dream than back into my childhood. When we’re little our memories merge with dreams. The Tiksi I went back to was nothing like the place I left. I found it really depressing. I didn’t have any relatives or friends, and the state of the town shocked me. When I lived there, Tiksi’s population was around 12,000. Now, it’s less than half that.One day, I went to the shore. I saw a family having a picnic with a bonfire. A little girl was throwing stones into the sea. She reminded me of myself. I took a picture of her, from the back, and didn’t think much more of it. But when I returned home to New York it was the only photo I’d taken that was interesting. I knew I had to find her again.I spent two years in and out of Tiksi, much of it with the girl, Tanya. I wanted to reconnect with the town through her eyes: to find her secret places, her favourite spots, and try and recover my past through her.She was a really happy child. She was 12 when I met her, approaching her teenage years, but still very much in her childhood. She was very playful and she loved the idea of photographing Tiksi, showing me around. But she was also very dreamy, and still is. In that regard, we had a lot in common.I was practically living with her family, almost like their adopted daughter. When this photo was taken, it was a beautiful summer’s day in June, and Tanya and I decided to go out for a walk. For some reason, she was convinced she was going to grow out of her favourite dress the following day — she insisted on wearing it because she would never be able to again. She tied her hair in pigtails and we wandered towards the sea.A dog started following us. When people left Tiksi, many abandoned their pets so there are loads of stray dogs wandering through the town. This one clearly wanted Tanya to adopt her. It was a beautiful make-believe: the dog pretended Tanya was its owner, and Tanya pretended the dog was her own.She was always climbing on things and scrambling around. She waded out and jumped on this little iceberg. This is the moment she was beckoning her new dog to join her. I knew I had to get the shot.I think the experience of taking this image was a closure for me. Through Tanya, I was able to reconnect with my childhood, to make sense of the place I had left and to rediscover the Arctic as my homeland.Today, the photo often gets read as a symbol. People have always romanticised the Arctic, and looked at it with a kind of awe. Now, we look at it and we’re scared, or we want to extract something from it. My work isn’t about “saving the Arctic”, but I hope it offers another way of looking at the region: a loving way, an appreciative way, one that reminds the viewer of their smallness in front of it.I’m still very close to Tanya and I know this photo is very special to her. She’s in college now, but she once told me it’s the last image of her before she became a teenager, a time before exams and college and job applications – the last photograph of her childhood.Trained: Documentary photography at the International Center of Photography, New York.Influences: “Magical realist writers in general, Gabriel García Márquez in particular.”High point: “Taking an icebreaker across almost the whole northern sea route for two and a half months.”Low point: “The constant self-doubt of being a freelancer.”Top tip: “Figure out what really moves you and stick with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b9171e99d208fe9f01090a49246965579ec47f/0_22_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e55ea437f35e741372fffded6d377d33","title":"this brutal house by niven govinden review","story":"New York’s riotous drag ball scene is the setting for a stylised story about political resistanceThe recent BBC drama series Pose was a joyful reminder of the mid-80s voguing scene, an underground efflorescence of creativity in New York’s queer community. In riotous club nights called balls, rival houses, each led by a “Mother”, competed to show off outrageous costumes and moves parodying film stars and models. The final arbiter was the vogue caller, who thought up the sartorial themes and provided the vicious commentary accompanying their efforts. Taking a more sombre tone, Niven Govinden uses these balls as a backdrop to a story of civil disobedience and political resistance.In the opening section, a group of Mothers are staging a silent protest outside City Hall. Use of the first person plural turns them into a kind of Greek chorus. In their forties and fifties, feeling around 80 in gay years, they describe how they took in young men who had been rejected by their parents and community, fed, clothed and moulded them into the peacocks and as who strut by night, gaining kudos for their houses. But their “gurls”, some of whom work the streets, have been going missing and the protest seems the only way to force the police out of their inaction.Teddy, the protagonist, has graduated from one of the houses to a regular job in the city, and he becomes the Mothers’ supporter, go-between and conduit to power. At the heart of the novel are the twin concepts of reality and “realness”, an artificiality better than the real thing that is the highest accolade of the vogue walk. Reality is biological mothers rejecting their sons because of their sexuality realness is the nurturing, scolding Mothers. Realness points out the hypocrisy of a city where the police neither protect nor serve, and public services are extended only to those deemed worthy of them.Teddy’s motivation is his hopeless love for Sherry, one of the missing. The police have forgotten the victims, but it’s strange that the plot does too, relegating them to McGuffin status. Govinden’s decision to favour style over storyline could also be seen as a form of realness. He gives us nine pages of the vogue caller’s categories: “Category is: drunk tank realness … Category is: TV evangelicals on the run realness.” They are amusing, but reading eight pages of his injunction to “Walk. Walk. Walk. Walk” is less so. Teddy never really comes to life in his long passages of reported thought, and when this sensible, cautious character makes the catastrophic mistake that up-ends the protest, it seems more like a desperate way out of a plot impasse than a twist.• This Brutal House is published by Dialogue (RRP £14.99).

Hundreds of millions of people disturbed by the pace of advancement in their country are turning to faith for the meaning and hope they don’t find in the radically secular world around them. This search for the sacred is shifting social structures and shaping China’s future in new and significant ways.With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China’s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people.After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China’s five official religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism – are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression.Shanghai Sacred explores the spaces, rituals and communities – in official, unofficial, public and private forms – that together weave the spiritual fabric of the city. Intimate photographs document the creativity of the faithful when creating ‘sacred space’ in a dense and restless urban environment.The traditional east Asian Buddhist practice of freeing captive animals to accrue good karma has flourished dramatically in recent years in Shanghai, in step with the rise of social media and online money donation, which keeps the practice afloat. Here hundreds of inhabitants gather to liberate $3,000 (£2,400) worth of fish bought from the market that morning. Monks or devout lay people organise weekly devotional gatherings, performing the ritual throughout the public space, thus creating a new economy for fishermen and a sense of belonging in an ever-changing urban environment.In 1921, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) was founded in Shanghai. This museum venerates the party and preserves the “official” memories of this occasion with a waxwork of Mao Zedong at the founding meeting. This space is part of the sacred geography of the city and a place that Chinese tourists visit in a reverent manner.The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs’ cemetery commemorates the CCP members and other activists who died during the revolutionary struggles of 1928-37. Located on a former section of the grounds of the Longhua Buddhist temple, it is part of the “sacred geography” of Shanghai.Dongyue temple hosts one of China’s three official Taoist learning centres and has seen a resurgence of students in recent years. The male students are trained in academic subjects, such as English and history, as well as in Taoist doctrine and ritual practice. Daily meditation time in a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled room has been tacked on to the curriculum.Baiyun (white clouds) Taoist temple was originally built in 1863 just outside the walled city. In 2004, the entire temple was relocated to within the former walled city. Moving temple buildings is not uncommon in China’s radical redevelopments.Jasmine left her job as a doctor to study traditional Tibetan Buddhist therapies. She offers Tibetan bowl singing therapy to her Chinese clients at a members’ club in the centre of Shanghai. With a growing interest in different forms of Buddhist practice, her business has proved lucrative.Super Brand Mall is one of the largest shopping centres in Asia. The Chia Tai Group, its Thai developer, set up a Buddhist shrine outside the entrance. A flow of passersby perform rituals at the shrine, which are believed to have improved the mall’s business.Throughout history migrants and traders from afar have brought new ideas, language and lifestyles to Shanghai and integrated them with local customs to form distinct, syncretic cultures. A young boy of mixed Chinese and Indian parentage celebrates Diwali in the luxurious Shimao Riviera garden compound.Twice a year people come to join the residents of Jinze Town on the outskirts of Shanghai to celebrate the birthdays of local gods. Members of devotional groups of the region show their skills at inserting gongs, incense burners or fishing hooks into their forearms.Fushouyuan is a luxury cemetery park. Most Shanghainese cannot afford to buy a funerary slot here. However, another option is available: a tower in the centre of the cemetery contains cabinets, which are sold as containers for ashes.Elaborate items are made out of paper as offerings for the dead. They also reflect the values of the living. Among these offerings, the omnipresence of joss paper houses speaks of both the scarcity of housing that Shanghai experienced in the past and the rapid pace of urban transformation from the 1990s onwards.On the coldest day in Shanghai for more than 40 years, migrant workers share a hot lunch offered by the Protestant church after the Sunday service held in a factory. The dedication to their faith and sense of community, as well as the promise of a hearty bowl of noodle soup, fuelled the congregation as they stood for two hours in -8C. The church, located in an old factory, was soon after moved to make way for the construction of Shanghai Disneyland.Pastor Dai Lizen, born in 1918, is the oldest female pastor in Shanghai. In 1981, she became the first woman to be ordained in the city. She trained as a pastor before the Cultural Revolution and retrained afterwards to serve a flourishing church community. She lives in one room within the church compound.Orthodox Christianity is not one of the five recognised religions in China. Services are held in the Russian Consulate due to its extraterritoriality status. The Easter 2016 service was the first one that both foreigners and Chinese were allowed to attend.A couple practise singing before a Taizé prayer evening at a Catholic church. Such events have become popular among young Catholics, who often meet partners there. A regular singles’ day is held to encourage matchmaking within the church.St Teresa’s church is located within one of the biggest lilong (lane house compound) of Shanghai, comprising of about 700 houses. In recent years a major relocation project has left many of these structures empty. The remaining church complex contains a number of artists’ workshops, including that of a nationally renowned stained-glass artist.The Fuyou Road Mosque is the smallest of Shanghai’s mosques, constructed in 1870 during the Qing Dynasty and re-established as a thriving centre of Islamic education and prayer after the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).The faithful put their hand over a nephrite stone invested with “spiritual efficacy” at Jing’an temple. Nephrite jade was highly prized by the imperial court and thought more precious than silver or gold. It is a mineral of both secular and spiritual import.On New Year’s Eve, the Jiang family set a table in their kitchen with food and wine for their ancestors. After burning three incense sticks, leaving time for the ancestors to eat, they perform a worship ceremony (jizu) by burning handmade tin-leaf ingots (xibo).Indian Hindu woman lead an active spiritual life in Shanghai that includes Sanskrit reading classes and devotional singing groups in their homes in the Shimao Riviera garden compound. The community chose this compound because of its close proximity to the Huangpu River, channelling the pivotal role of holy waterways to Indians.The first thorough investigation of religious practices in a Chinese city, Shanghai Sacred was created collaboratively over four years by photographer and anthropologist Liz Hingley, alongside Professor Benoît Vermander, of the Xu-Ricci Dialogue Center at Fudan University and Liang Zhang, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

My crime is way worse than binge drinking in Benidorm, or mortifying locals in Rhodes with sex acts performed in front of their Orthodox chapels. I’m the party pooper who, while on holiday in destinations popular with Britons, has the audacity to ask: what actually happened here?For example, I had the good fortune to find myself in Jamaica last month after a filming stint in Kingston, when I realised that my hotel was actually named after a former slave plantation on whose grounds it still stands. That history is completely invisible to the predominantly British tourists who stay there, unless they go out of their way to visit Rose Hall, a museum on the other side of the vast estate where the owners’ “Great House” still stands.Once you get past the British couples having their wedding photos taken on the steps of this slavery HQ – a strange choice in my personal opinion – the museum’s emphasis is all on the white mistress who lived here (an alleged serial killer of her slavemaster husbands) with barely a mention of the African slaves themselves. The cell where those who attempted to escape had their legs amputated by a bear trap, and were left to bleed to death, is now a tourist toilet that the guides assure visitors is “perfectly safe to use”. Tourists are reminded, repeatedly, that this site, ground zero of one of the greatest horrors in human history – is “paradise”.If “paradise” is Jamaica, in the British tourist lexicon, then “Africa” is basically Kenya. I realised this when I visited the east African country, which attracts huge numbers of generally privileged British visitors, either gap-year students backpacking and volunteering, or people who can afford ultra-expensive safaris. The  ran a piece recently listing 18 reasons to visit Kenya, and hardly any of them had anything to do with its African inhabitants, relating predominantly to the wildlife, landscape and history of any British royalty who had deigned to visit.In the highlands – site of a massive and enduring land grab by white settlers in the early 1900s – I met a British farmer who told me that were it not for his forebears, the natives would still be spearing each other in senseless “tribal wars”, which his community generously prevented by helping themselves to hundreds of thousands of the most fertile acres, creating a system of apartheid, and amassing significant personal fortunes in the process.There is no mention of this rather crucial episode in Kenyan history if you visit Karen Blixen’s house – an eery time capsule in which the aristocratic Danish author’s memoir Out of Africa was set, where nostalgia for an era of white adventure and loyal black servitude is a key attraction for today’s British tourists. It’s not subtle. When you go to buy wooden carvings in the gift shops in Nairobi afterwards, you may even be greeted by a Maasai warrior paid to balance on one leg.Both these countries depend significantly on British tourism, and as someone who treasures having been able to witness the beauty of both their culture and landscape, the last thing I would do is disparage that. Instead, I took it upon myself to talk to the other visitors I met about the aspects of the history that were conspicuously absent from tours that have been carefully designed not to make them feel offended, guilty, or uncomfortable in any way.And do you know what I found? We underestimate the good old British holidaymaker. People who have invested the time and money in travelling to Jamaica or Kenya – let’s not forget that by far the most popular holiday destination for Britons is the far closer and more affordable Spain – are genuinely interested in learning something new. Many have an intellectual curiosity that could cope with an honest appraisal of what happened in the past and how it relates to the seemingly faraway island that they inhabit. Everyone I spoke to, during the unofficial alternative history talks that I took upon myself to deliver (I told you I’m an annoying person to meet on holiday) said how little of these events they knew, yet how interested they were to learn more.They may have been politely trying to get rid of me. But I believe there is an opportunity to be honest with and educate British tourists in parts of the former British empire, instead of which we are stuck in denial. Tour operators, hotel and museum owners think that visitors want to hear something that conforms to their already comfortable worldview. They then produce experiences that do so, and British holidaymakers come away with their preconceptions neatly confirmed.It’s hard enough to get people to think about these questions here in Britain. But if Britons are still being helped to avoid the truth of empire in the places where it happened, and where local people are still living with the consequences, then what hope have we got?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0640211940346bdb8fa2e2a58dcf3b650a8e6c8/473_658_5266_3159/master/5266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b4677a8fd6245ddaa4878fb4091d593","title":"global measles revival trust vaccine rates science","story":"There’s no vaccine against distrust in vaccines. Millions of children in the world used to die each year from infections like measles. Now, thanks to routine immunisation programmes, they don’t. But just because we hardly see these infections in the UK any more, it doesn’t mean we can be complacent.Although nearly all British parents vaccinate their children, one in five people in the UK aren’t convinced that vaccines are safe, according to the largest ever survey of global attitudes to science and health, published this week. This is worrying, because distrust can let infections like measles come back with a vengeance.The worldwide spike in measles last year was largely due to sharp increases in just 10 countries. Most, like Yemen and Ukraine, have been experiencing conflict or unrest. That doesn’t explain the rise in France, though, where there were six times as many cases of measles as in 2017.In France, one in three people disagree that vaccines are safe. That’s more than in any other nation in the Wellcome Global Monitor, which surveyed more than 140,000 people in 144 countries.There are many reasons why you might not get vaccinated. Perhaps immunisation campaigns haven’t reached you. Maybe you don’t think these diseases are serious enough to merit getting immunity. Or you don’t have confidence in the vaccines themselves.Wellcome Global Monitor can’t tell us why some children are not getting vaccinated, but it can shed light on people’s confidence in vaccines. In most countries, confidence is higher among people who have higher levels of trust in health experts and scientists. Trust in scientists, in turn, is linked to trust in national institutions such as the government.So vaccine confidence is not just about giving people information or persuading them with logic – it’s bound up with how we feel about many other aspects of our lives. Understanding the causes of low confidence is important, but the next step must be to find ways to address people’s concerns effectively and build trust.The people at most risk during measles outbreaks are babies under a year old, and people with weak immune systems due to other conditions or treatments. To protect them, we all have to put our trust in vaccines.Vaccines are safe and they work that’s a fact. But until everyone is convinced, everyone else is at risk.• Charlie Weller is head of vaccines programme at Wellcome"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0853c66f8dacfc21eb8873c691ba379bd1dbd7ae/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e34079a126f817f64720c4e58eb9107d","title":"viktor orban democracy hungary eu funding","story":"The Hungarian prime minister is consolidating his illiberal regime – with the help of European Union fundingWhen European Union leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday they will have a guilty secret: among them will sit the leader of a member state that is no longer a democracy. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister and de facto supreme leader, will sit there smiling as a democrat among democrats, but in reality he has demolished liberal democracy in his country over the last decade. Adding insult to injury, he has used EU taxpayers’ money to consolidate his illiberal regime. With a new European parliament and fresh institutional leadership in prospect, the EU must show that it will defend democracy in its own member states. Otherwise, all the fine words of article 2 of its basic treaty will be worth nothing.To say that Hungary is no longer a democracy is a stark claim and I have thought, read and looked hard before making it. Often people apply the term that Orbán has himself used approvingly: “illiberal democracy”. But illiberal democracy is a contradiction in terms. That label may usefully describe a transitional phase in the erosion of a liberal democracy, such as we see in Poland, but Hungary is way beyond that. This year the human rights organisation Freedom House downgraded it to the status of “partly free” country, the only EU member state to earn that dishonour. The most neutral description I can find is that this is a “hybrid regime”, neither democracy nor dictatorship.Here are just a few characteristics of Orbán’s self-styled “system of national cooperation”. (How Orwell would relish that deceptive euphemism.) The ruling party, Fidesz, has so completely penetrated the state administration that Hungary is again a one-party state. On a recent visit to Budapest, I was given numerous examples of how governmental powers are routinely used for purposes of political control. The state administration favours Orbán cronies and family members with government contracts, punishes independent media owners and NGO or opposition supporters with arbitrary tax investigations, uses state resources for Fidesz election propaganda, and even refuses local planning permission to an architect known for his anti-Fidesz views.A new law on NGOs, similar to Vladimir Putin’s, has effectively forced out the Open Society Foundation of George Soros – the Jewish philanthropist against whom Orbán’s regime stirs up hatred, with propaganda imagery recalling the worst periods of European history. The Soros-funded Central European University has been compelled to move to Vienna for its core, degree-granting activities, and the government is now taking control of the research institutes and property of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.All this is done while keeping the outward appearance of a liberal democracy complying with European standards. A bevy of articulate, English-speaking Fidesz spokespeople, starting with Orbán himself, are at hand to denounce such criticisms. Look, they say, of course there are still independent media! Look, opposition parties got eight of the 21 seats in the European elections! Look, there is an American college that functions quite happily under the law you say was tailor-made to expel CEU! This is superficially clever stuff but, as an old central European Jewish saying has it, a half-truth is a whole lie.Yet faced with all this, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, could still welcome Orbán, at an earlier European summit, with the jocular greeting: “Hello, dictator!” Faced with all this, Manfred Weber’s European People’s party, even though it has suspended Fidesz from its membership, still counts the 13 Fidesz MEPs towards its group numbers in the new European parliament. For shame.Orbán’s demolition job is not irreversible. After all, even the post-totalitarian regime that ended in 1989 was ultimately reversible, and this hybrid regime has many more vulnerabilities. In this autumn’s local elections, for instance, a really effective coalition of opposition forces might yet win back Budapest.What, then, should the EU do? Immediately, Weber should not be made commission president – mainly because he does not have the top-level governmental experience, but also because he has legitimated Orbán’s dismantling of Hungarian democracy by keeping Fidesz in the EPP. The EPP itself, following a report by its three “wise men” (who will be three blind mice if they don’t see in Hungary what I have briefly summarised here), should finally boot out Fidesz. This action has much wider importance, since a moral and political imperative of our time is for civilised centre-right parties to draw a clear line between them and xenophobic, populist extremists.Then the EU must stop this tragic farce of its own funds being used to undermine European values. It should appoint as European public prosecutor the Romanian Laura Codruţa Kövesi, who knows exactly what post-communist, east European corruption looks like, and make signing up to scrutiny by that European public prosecutor a condition for receipt of those funds. It should also move to distribute more EU funding directly to local government and civil society, rather than letting it be used as a huge, centralised slush fund by a corrupt party-state.Not least, all European institutions and heads of government must keep the spotlight on this tragedy in the heart of Europe. Orbán himself is never constrained by excessive politeness nor should they be. What the EU does about Hungary matters not just for Hungarians but for Europe as a whole. The continent of Europe may have many different kinds of regime, but the European Union must be a community of democracies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c93f454df99bc29c99c8ddd91a10597c18bc1f2/180_38_3335_2002/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88473ef464dfbd4fff2339ae88826d93","title":"guatemalans pay price west need nickel","story":"A vast European-owned mine is operating near Mayan villages, sparking a battle for survivalby  Juliette Garside in GuatemalaThe road to Guatemala’s biggest nickel mine is barely visible through a cloud of red dust, churned up by the 25-tonne trucks that thunder past loaded with ore.From the choking haze a cyclist emerges, weaving between the lorries. On his back he carries a bundle of firewood. Goggles protect his eyes, a bandana covers his nose and mouth.Manuel Choc, a grandfather with greying hair, lives in the settlement of El Paraíso, almost opposite the gates of the Fenix mine. Each bundle sells for 10 quetzals (£1). It is a precarious living.“Many people have died on the road,” says Choc. “The trucks run them over and often they don’t stop. Many people. Someone died just over there. The drivers, they do nothing. But God, he knows.”In many ways, the perilous roads are the least of his problems.Exporting its mineral to Europe and beyond, where it is used in mills producing stainless steel, Fenix is the focus of claims about water and air pollution, and fears of political corruption.As the quarries expand, hundreds of families in the surrounding Mayan villages fear eviction, and the loss of the environment that sustains them.In September 2011, Fenix was bought by the Solway group, a European-owned business run from Switzerland. Theirs is a messy business. Their diggers work night and day, felling trees and excavating 2.6m tonnes a year.On the shores of Lake Izabal, the country’s largest expanse of fresh water, furnaces pump out smoke seven days a week. The chimneys - fitted with filters designed to reduce impurities – are part of a plant restored by Solway. It turns ore into ferronickel.Dozens, sometimes hundreds of trucks a day carry ore and ferronickel away to the Caribbean port of Santo Tomás de Castilla.The once sleepy town of El Estor, with its pretty lakeside promenade, is now the focus of a vicious environmental dispute.The company’s arrival created 3,000 jobs. But it has also brought conflict.It is facing claims – which it denies – of being implicated in a news blackout after charges were filed by the public prosecutor, in a case brought by Solway, against two journalists working for the Guatemalan news website Prensa Comunitaria.Green Blood, a consortium of international media led by the French group Forbidden Stories, has come together to continue their investigation. Working alongside Prensa Comunitaria, El País, Le Monde and other media outlets, the  has uncovered new evidence that will raise fresh questions about the environmental impact of the mine.Guatemala’s supreme court ruled in February that local people had not been properly consulted when the Fenix licence was renewed in 2006, under previous owners. Solway is appealing. If the decision is upheld, it will have to undertake a listening exercise.Working with a translator, we spoke to villagers to hear their concerns. Many report similar problems: water shortages, problems growing crops, coughs, skin rashes and eye infections.To date, no scientific study has conclusively linked these problems to the activities of the mine. Solway says it is careful not to destroy water sources, and its own research shows the air quality has not deteriorated since Fenix reopened.But many people do not trust the company, or the few government studies that have been produced, believing the state is prepared to prioritise the needs of industry over their own.When the settlers of El Paraíso moved here, the mine, which dates to the 1970s, lay dormant. They struck a deal with the government’s land bank, Fondo de Tierras, put up their huts and planted corn.But their crops are now failing. First the plants were stunted now Choc says they die as seedlings. Choc blames the dust.Whirling in from the lorries churning up the road, and the open cast quarries, it falls on the roofs. Corrugated iron that should last up to 14 years is rusted through in four.Choc’s neighbours lift their children’s T-shirts and point to skin rashes on backs, necks and chests.This summer, the stream on which El Paraíso depends for drinking water ran dry.The people here have an expression: the mine, they say, is “eating the mountain”.With Solway planning to dig for the next two decades, the communities say they are in peril.Some don’t appear on any official maps. In the eyes of the authorities, they simply do not exist. Until recently, the Q’eqchi’ were largely internal migrants. Now they are joining the caravans. In December, a seven-year-old Q’eqchi’ girl died in the custody of US customs in El Paso, Texas.Stories of death and violence swirl around Fenix. In 2012, three students drowned at a nature reserve owned by Solway.Last week, the company’s biologist was found guilty of culpable homicide and his former employer ordered to pay reparations to the families. In 2016, when a boiler in the refinery exploded, seven employees were killed.Last year the head of El Gosen village was abducted and then jailed. During his absence, his people were evicted from land which Solway says they were squatting. The company offered them financial assistance to move.Tensions in El Estor escalated in March 2017, when a red stain spread across the lake. The fishermen blamed the refinery.Their unions decided to picket the road to Fenix. The trucks stopped rolling. Women and children were trapped inside the “colony”, a compound surrounded by a high wall where the mine workers live with their families.As the colony started to run out of food, and piles of untransported ore mounted, so did pressure on the local authorities to end the dispute. After a brief truce, negotiations fell apart and the protesters put up a new blockade.El Estor is still reeling from the actions that were taken next.Witnesses say that at 2pm on 27 May, police first launched teargas, then opened fire. The fisherman Carlos Maaz Coc had picked up a stone. He was shot in the chest before it left his hand. The police fled the scene, after wounding another demonstrator, leaving Maaz’s body on the tarmac.Instead of drawing back, the mine pressed the public prosecutor to take legal action against the demonstrators. The head of the fishermen’s union was eventually detained by police in Puerto Barrios prison. His deputy was held there for a year and is now on bail.Arrest warrants were issued for two indigenous journalists working for Prensa Comunitaria, Carlos Choc and Jerson Xitumul. Their names were added by the prosecutor to a list of fishermen accused of holding company staff captive. Choc went into hiding, and Xitumul was placed under house arrest. The case against Xitumul has since been dropped, and earlier this year, the prosecutor and the company asked for the charges against Choc to be dismissed, but the judge overseeing the case refused, requesting further investigations.And so it drags on.El Estor’s parish priest, who was three metres away from Maaz when he saw the police open fire, is horrified by events.“It is the modus operandi of many companies to impose fear, calling you a delinquent … and it seems that the strategy has worked for them,” says Padre Ernesto Rueda Moreno. “The union is completely overshadowed.”Among his parishioners, he says, there is “an almost complicit silence”.The company says it has a duty to protect its staff and their families, and that it does not seek to silence or harass journalists.A day after the shooting, the government held a press conference to announce that an algae bloom had turned the waters red. Its report blamed pollution from agriculture and sewage.But concerns about the refinery persist.A recent water analysis obtained by Prensa Comunitaria for this investigation raises fresh questions. Produced by Amasurli, the government-funded agency for the sustainable management of the Izabal basin, it concludes the lake is undergoing “eutrophication” – an excessive richness of nutrients leading to overgrowth of plant life.In 2018, nitrite salts were 54 times higher than the “regular” (safe) level, and phosphates were twice as high. The results for 2017, the year of the red stain, are missing. Amasurli’s explanation is that monitoring was “not realised” that year.What causes the eutrophication? The report concludes this is due to agriculture and sewage. Independent experts agree with this. A 2019 chart for 11 water quality monitoring stations shows the highest levels of nitrites and phosphates were found at the mouths of two canals that connect with the refinery.One is an entry canal, which takes water from the lake to cool the furnaces. The other is an exit canal, built to take water back to the lake.No one has an explanation for the results from the canals. Solway insists it does not use nitrites or phosphates in its processes. It says its exit canal has been closed since the refinery reopened in 2014.Nonetheless, Oswaldo Calderón, regional director for the environmental protection agency Fundaeco, remains concerned about Izabal and its wildlife. Manatees were once a common site in El Estor – they feature on the town council’s logo. Now, he says, they are moving away. He blames intensive farming, and the recent arrival of fish cages in the lake, which are introducing new chemicals like fertilisers. But he has concerns about the mine too.“The lake is really threatened. We have mining, bananas, sugar cane, and they have begun using it to farm fish. If this continues my fear is that it will become a swamp.”“If I could, I would just close the mine,” said Calderón. “This company is only bringing social conflict.”On the banks of the Trincheras River, a group of community mayors has gathered. They live at the foot of a second nickel mine owned by Solway, known as Montúfar.A canal draining rainwater from the quarries is pouring red earth into the river. The company says its tests indicate the presence of suspended solids – an indicator of water quality – does not exceed government limits.The mayors have a bigger concern: 7,000 people depend for their drinking water on cascades near where Solway is working. Over farming and deforestation are having an impact here. But communities continue to see the mine as part of the problem. “The waterfalls are slowly drying out,” says Mario Sandoval, mayor of Nehua. Since the rains began, he says, the number of litres per person per day has not risen from its summer low. “If the government don’t take this mine out of here, we are ready to put a stop to this. Soon they are going to be taking this side of the mountain away.”Back in El Estor, Q’eqchi’ leaders have gathered for their first meeting since the blockades. Juan Putal May, 52, lives in Semuc, inside the licence area. The principal spiritual guide of his village, he was born and raised here. In recent years, he has noticed changes. “Areas that were once humid and green are now dry and bare. It doesn’t rain as much. Agriculture, it’s over.”Ten years ago, a single “task” or plot would produce 30kg (70lb) of corn. Today it takes 16 plots to harvest the same quantity. Chili will no longer grow lemons shrivel on the tree.Families are leaving for the Petén region, further north. The dust is another issue: those left behind have skin rashes and sore eyes.Aníbal Coti, who runs the El Estor health centre, says conjunctivitis, bronchitis and asthma are on the rise. “Here, in the mornings, the dust begins to fall as if it were volcano sand,” says Coti. “It is regrettable the ministry of health does not pronounce on any of this.”Solway says Fenix takes every precaution not to impact the environment. The refinery chimneys are monitored to ensure the level of dust they expel remains within the legal limits.Dmitri Kudryakov runs the company’s operations in Guatemala.His foremen are young and bright, and seem enthusiastic about their work. In the corridor outside are football trophies from community matches.“When I came in 2012 the engineers could not enter certain communities, because they looked at us with caution,” he says. “Today there is no community that denies us entry. We can go to play a soccer game. We are invited to celebrate a wedding, Mother’s Day …”Asked whether the company has a plan to remedy water shortages, Kudryakov says rivers and streams fluctuate with “biological cycles”, just like the harvests. He says the mine is not to blame.“We have identified all the sources, in a zone of possible influence … and obviously we are not working near them. If necessary we plant trees additionally near the springs.”In the capital, Guatemala City, Luis Chang, the minister of energy and mines, points the finger at external factors. “I would ask what European countries are doing to halt climate change, which is one of the main conditioning factors in reducing the uptake of water sources.”He dismisses indigenous complaints as based on perception and rumour, rather than facts. The solution, he believes, is dialogue.Despite Kudryakov’s protestations, tensions remain high in El Estor. Recent weeks have seen sporadic blockades. At El Paraíso, Choc says he is staying put. “Until we die this is our home. We can’t leave. We will last until we last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c6758e179cd20ced71e0631bed6993f3f00d4b/0_190_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b25433763d146d6c8dfcad44a7e4339","title":"sadiq khan announces car free day in london to tackle air pollution","story":"Event will take place on 22 September across 18 boroughs, with road closures and eventsSadiq Khan has announced plans to implement London’s biggest car-free day to date, closing 12.3 miles (20km) of roads in the centre of the capital in September.Roads will be closed for the event around London Bridge, Tower Bridge and much of the City of London to help tackle the capital’s air pollution crisis, which kills thousands of people each year and leaves two million – including 400,000 children – living in areas with illegally dirty air.Boroughs across the city will also hold events promoting walking, cycling and public transport, as well as creating scores of “play streets”.It is the first time a London mayor has closed down large sections of roads in the city centre. Khan said the day would offer an opportunity for people to leave their cars behind and explore streets by foot or by bike.“I encourage as many Londoners as possible to join in the fun and see the city from a different perspective,” he said.The event, which will take place on 22 September, has been given a cautious welcome by campaigners.Areeba Hamid of Greenpeace UK said: “It’s exciting to see London adopting the idea of having a car-free day, something great cities across the world from Paris to Bogotá have been giving a try … Reducing toxic air pollution and carbon emissions are vital, but they are far from the only benefit of reclaiming our streets.”Dr Audrey de Nazelle, an academic at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London, said the event was important to show people how enjoyable a car-free city would be.“Being aware of the scale of air pollution health problems is not enough. Actually living the joys of a car-free or carless city will do much more to create a positive vision of what a future healthy London could be like,” she said.Hundreds of activities will take place across the closed streets in central London, with 18 boroughs planning to work with residents to create play streets for children, where communities can get together. It is hoped more than 150,000 Londoners will join in.The move comes as concerns mount about the impact of the UK’s poisonous air, which causes 40,000 early deaths a year.Last year, an unprecedented joint inquiry by MPs described air pollution as a “national health emergency”. Their report was scathing about the government’s clean air plans, which have been judged illegal three times in the high court. The latest proposal, rejected by the court, was described as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.London’s air pollution crisis is responsible for 9,000 early deaths each year. The scale of the problem was laid bare with figures showing every person in the capital breathes air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

That moment caught the imagination of the journalist Bill McKibben, who has written and campaigned on climate breakdown ever since.

Here are 10 of the most memorable ...1953: Maggie Smith sings saucy songsSince the very beginning, the Fringe has been about catching tomorrow’s stars, today. And some of its earliest performers got very big, very quickly. Anyone who visited in 1953 and took in a sparsely attended revue called Cakes and Ale has presumably felt extremely smug about it for the rest of their lives. Why? Because singing three of the numbers in it was a young Maggie Smith, who used the contacts she made at the Fringe that year to help kickstart one of the most distinguished acting careers in history.1966: Tom Stoppard hits the big timeIf you’re looking for the ultimate Edinburgh Festival Fringe fairytale, then Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is it. A 29-year-old Tom Stoppard went up to the festival an unknown, and returned on his way to being one of the most famous playwrights ever. His head-spinning metatheatrical rewrite of Shakespeare’s Hamlet had been passed over by professional companies, and initial reviews of the Oxford Theatre Group’s student production at the Fringe were not kind. Then, boom: the Observer’s Ronald Bryden called it “the most brilliant debut by a young playwright since John Arden” and the legend was made.1976: Rowan Atkinson gets noticedFrom Stephen Fry to Emma Thompson, the number of Brit comedy legends who got their break at the Fringe in Oxbridge revues of the 70s and 80s is genuinely staggering. But 1976 was a particularly auspicious year: an electrical engineering student named Rowan Atkinson caused a tremendous stir when he came up with The Oxford Revue (which included his future Blackadder writer Richard Curtis), getting laughs from material in which there should have been no laughs. TV producer John Lloyd saw Atkinson and resolved to make him a star he succeeded.198889: Macbeth in the Firth of ForthThere are familiar Fringe venues, and every year there are the weird and wonderful one-offs. Perhaps the most audacious of these was Inchcolm, an island in the Firth of Forth, upon which artist and promoter Richard Demarco staged a full period dress production of Macbeth in the late 80s. It’s gone down as an iconic and provocative moment, and was reprised in 2012.1991: Graham Norton dresses as a very famous nunBefore Graham Norton was the reigning king of the comedy chat show, even prior to his breakthrough television role as Father Ted’s infuriating Father Noel Furlong, he began his career at the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe doing something … very odd. His drag show, Mother Teresa of Calcutta’s Grand Farewell Tour, saw the young Norton don a tea towel and perform cabaret in the persona of the renowned Indian-Albanian nun Mother Teresa, reimagined as an Irish housewife. You kind of had to be there, but the show’s mischievous humour has powered one of the most enduring careers in British and Irish comedy.1995: Jenny Eclair swears a lotMany performers became overnight sensations at the Fringe. Others had to wait a bit longer. Jenny Eclair was the first ever woman to win the comedy award – which she did on her 13th trip to the festival. It was a long time coming, but in the end it couldn’t have gone to anyone else: her aggressively in-yer-face, take-no-shit-from-anyone hit “Prozac and Tantrums” was swaggering 90s Britain incarnate.1997: The League of Gentlemen creep everyone outIn 1997 the three performing members of sketch troupe The League of Gentlemen – Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton – wore dinner jackets for the duration of their creepily original sketch show, and the horrors depicted within took place in a town called Spent, not Royston Vasey. In most other respects, though, they were the finished deal, and their subsequent rise was meteoric: they had a radio show later that year, and a hit TV show by 1999.2002: Jerry Springer – the Opera hits the right notesSome ideas are just so mad that you can’t really pitch them – you have to do them yourself and hope the world agrees with you. Richard Thomas and Stewart Lee’s Jerry Springer – the Opera was an obscenity- and blasphemy-filled actual opera based upon the pugilistic US chat show. It was a completely bizarre idea, but Edinburgh audiences got it: it was snapped up by the National Theatre straight after.2002: Nancy Sinatra plays her first ever British concertThe Fringe is more than just comedians and theatre: it also features a lively musical programme. Perhaps the most iconic performer to make her UK debut there was Nancy Sinatra: having failed to stage a single British concert during the 20th century, she finally played our sceptred isle at the age of 62, dressed head-to-toe in gold lamé.2012: Eddie Izzard invites some guy called Trevor Noah overIn 2012, Eddie Izzard was evangelising about a slick, original South African stand-up named Trevor Noah whom he’d adopted as his protege and brought to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Noah’s The Racist was a brilliantly original consideration of growing up mixed race in apartheid South Africa. Three years later, he dropped in on the Fringe again, just before he headed off to global fame as the new host of The Daily Show.To find out more about the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe – and how to make the most of your time there – head to edfringe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b56672474e036194b5a805031f7b7280f12de7/140_2_2719_1631/master/2719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a57fdbff394c5040b48583b764fe13","title":"trans film frameline43 san francisco festival","story":"San Francisco’s Frameline43 festival highlights the evolution of trans lives onscreen – from bigotry to complex realityThings are tense. The 18-year-old who left home to find herself in the big city has just had her first lesbian encounter concluded with a savage bite to the neck. Turns out that her sexual partner is a vampire, and now she’s a vampire too. Will she take the antidote and go back to being human, or will she embrace eternal life and a diet of blood? It’s a tough choice but the fact that years ago she made a different kind of transition makes things easier.Welcome to the brave new world of trans film. Once dominated by misunderstanding, exoticization and bigotry, transgender film has evolved to explore the complex realities of trans lives. The films offered at San Francisco’s Frameline43 – one of the largest LGBT film festivals in the world – showcase just how far trans movies have come.One major flash point over trans inclusion has been in sports, which Michael Barnett’s documentary Changing the Game tackles head on. It follows Mack, a transmasculine teen wrestler forced to compete in the women’s league, as well as the teenagers Sarah and Andraya, transfeminine athletes fighting to play as women. Barnett gives the athletes ample space to share their experience, while also exploring the many ways that the cis world complicates their simple request to compete with other boys and girls.It’s clear that Mack has no desire to wrestle those who aren’t his gender. The film poignantly shares his struggles to compete with all his heart, even when facing the impossible double-bind of being denounced as a “fake male” while also called a boy who unfairly beats up on girls. Talking heads on Fox News and other cable channels deride Mack for “pumping testosterone” to get an unfair advantage.Mack’s, Sarah’s and Andraya’s needs as transgender athletes are butting up against institutions whose conception and evolution never took into account the possibility of transgender competitors, and much of Changing the Game is about how these institutions are trying – and not trying – to respond to this challenge. It deftly discusses many sides of the complicated situations that it investigates – the only thing that really feels missing is an airing of what, if any, advantage transgender athletes may have over their cisgender counterparts.Other films in the Frameline program tread so lightly that audiences may not even realize they’re watching trans actors. Bit is a fun vampire flick that follows Laurel (Nicole Maines), a trans teen, as she leaves the nest to explore adult life in Los Angeles. The typical coming-of-age story is given a twist when Laurel is initiated into a group of edgy young female vampires – instead of going out to party and have sex, she’s going out to party, have sex, and drink the blood of unsuspecting men.The genre material is given some nice touches that add heft to the campy plotline. The vampires that Laurel meets also happen to be feminists: one of their cardinal rules is never to turn a man into a vampire, since they can’t be trusted with the powers of eternal life and mind control. As this is being explained to Laurel, she ever-so-subtly references her own transition, and the vampires let her know that she’s not a man in their eyes.Similarly, Razor Tongue features a trans lead many viewers would probably never realize is transgender if she didn’t out herself late in season one. The web series follows the life of Belle, a young woman of Chamorro ancestry who lives in LA and battles exoticization and low-key misogyny by verbally eviscerating anyone who crosses her. Belle’s worldview becomes complicated when she falls in love with an abrasive man who challenges her assumptions, and when another woman tries to call out her hypocrisy on a live podcast.One noteworthy thing about Razor Tongue, which it shares with the considerably heavier web series King Ester, is its intersectionality – questions of gender identity are intimately tied to questions of race, class, and longstanding sex stereotypes. In the case of Ester, it’s a young, African American trans woman in a rough part of New Orleans who feels invisible compared to cis women, and who is struggling to realize everything she offers to the world. While Razor Tongue’s Belle is also a person of color, her very different background and current circumstances necessitate vastly different intersectional questions. Films and shows such as Razor Tongue and King Ester are welcome for the sophistication with which they navigate longstanding questions of discrimination and update them for a new generation.Exploring the struggles of a character assigned female at birth who doesn’t fit into either pole of the gender binary, the stylish coming-of-age film Zen in the Ice Rift gestures at the one notable exclusion from Frameline43’s trans movies: nonbinary identities. Although much of the attention on trans culture has been directed toward binary transitions, gender identities that embrace fluidity andor points on the spectrum that are not identifiably male or female are an emergent – and now essential – part of the trans landscape. Taking a refreshing perspective on the confusion and discovery that is an inherent part of any transgender life, Zen in the Ice Rift touches on territory that the trans genre will hopefully map out in greater depth in coming years.The festival also explores trans lives around the world. Brief Story from the Green Planet is a surreal Argentine sci-fi road trip, where transgender characters share screen space with extraterrestrials. The Garden Left Behind explores life for undocumented trans people when Tina, a cab driver in New York, makes the difficult decision to transition. And Unsettled documents the lives of four asylum-seekers who have fled homophobic violence from Africa and the Middle East.Frameline43’s trans selections take seriously a core responsibility of cinema: to be aware that who and what it shows to audiences will become sources of role models and cultural understanding. This power is seen in another film playing at the festival, Queering the Script, which documents the many facets of LGBTQ+ fandom and showcases droves of viewers who have been inspired to lead authentic lives by the characters they watch onscreen.

However …I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster – and they were on offer in Morrisons.What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by ’eck, the brew bearing my county’s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn’t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is murky. It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed.Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn’t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62.It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but moderate sleuthing reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn’t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn’t carry convey quite the same romance.It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country.Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It’s strong and northern, like me. We don’t even keep it local in the ’s Manchester office, despite the paper’s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes’ tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier.But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation’s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs Tea from the Manor, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west.He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover’s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters.A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate.He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as “dust”. That, he says, is what we will find inside all the tea bags we are to test today – blends, he suggests, that are fine only in texture. Cheap and tawdry, lowest common denominator stuff. He wants me to compare the dust with the much bigger dried tea leaves he puts into Tea from the Manor blends, which he insists will impart vastly more flavour.I line up the teas we are to taste: Yorkshire Tea, Lancashire Tea, Cornish Tea, West Country Tea, Welsh Tea and Ringtons (which trades heavily on its Newcastle-upon-Tyne origins), plus the only tea I could find that is grown wholly in Britain: Kinnettles Gold, propagated and hand-rolled on a farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, in such tiny quantities that they produce no more than 2kg a year.Green is not keen to taste these heathen teas: “It’s like asking someone used to drinking fine wines to have a bottle of cheap cider.” Nonetheless, he forces down a few mouthfuls, grimacing as if I have made him drink meths. He complains of a “furry taste” (Ringtons), being left with a coating on his tongue (Cornish) and points out some white scum that gathers in the Yorkshire bag. We decide to make each cuppa as I would at home or in the office: straight into the cup. We are not to stir – or worse, use a teaspoon to squeeze out the flavour: “Stirring it is wrong. We should let it steep itself.”I can’t tell the difference between most of them – apart from the fairy-light and appleish Kinnettles, which isn’t an English Breakfast blend and really belongs in a totally different category. I decide I like Ringtons best: it is neither baggy nor crepy and has slightly smoky overtones. Yorkshire and Welsh are pretty much interchangeable: a discovery confirmed by blind tastings in the ’s Manchester office, where even proud Bradfordian Josh Halliday, a lifelong Yorkshire Tea drinker, was fooled by its Welsh brethren.Nazia Parveen, a Brummie, manages to distinguish northern from southern. We all agree the Cornish and West Country brews are a bit too light for our unsubtle palates. It could be the water: ours in Manchester is soft and might not bring out the best in teas blended in England’s lower half. That said, most tea blenders import water from across the UK to check their product will still be drinkable outside their home region.Back at Tea from the Manor, Green reluctantly tastes a sip of Lancashire. He rolls out another simile to explain the offence I am causing his taste buds – “It’s like making a Bugatti owner drive a Transit van” – and makes a face. “Not nice.” He prefers its transpennine rival, too, not that you would ever catch him drinking mass-produced “dust” on his own time.But before Yorkshire folk get too cocky, their brew didn’t come out top in my tasting test. That honour went to Ringtons of Newcastle. Forget the Wars of the Roses: the Geordies win the ’s tea tussle.* Don’t bother the readers’ editor with this one, Yorkshire chums. Yes, there were several wars, not one, and you won a few. But the last one ended when Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), a Lancastrian, defeated and killed Yorkie Richard III (the car park king) at Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. So we won.Yorkshire Tea (£2.79 for 80 teabags) A no-nonsense brew, befitting a county that gave us Geoffrey Boycott and Sean Bean. Like a Yorkshire terrier: feisty but reliable and surprisingly domineering. 45Cornish Tea (£2.99 for 80 teabags) Pleasant enough but lacking in personality. I was expecting more subversion from a tea with the subtitle “smuggler’s brew”. 35Welsh Brew Gold (£3.69 for 80 teabags) A hearty brew – strong and confident, yet strangely comforting, like a male voice choir. Can double for Yorkshire Tea. 45Ringtons Gold (£3.97 for 100 teabags) Blended on Tyneside since 1907, Ringtons is my fave: a slightly smoky brew with a bright and golden hue. 55Miles West Country Original (£2.50 for 80 teabags) Barely there. Disappointing for a region famed for its cream teas and Cheddar cheese. 35Lancashire Tea (£2.30 for 80 teabags) Odd purplish hue. As satisfying as a weak handshake. Very “meh” for the county of strong women like Thora Hird, Emmeline Pankhurst and Barbara Castle. 25Kinnettles Gold (£40 for a 20g tin) Grown and hand-rolled on Kinnettles farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, this delicate yellow-green tea bears no relation to any of the above but scores highly for refreshment and novelty value. 45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

But along with holidays and tickets to shows, dining out is proving beyond the budget of Britain’s youngest adults, who, according to new figures, have suffered a slump in their spending power for life’s non-essentials while their parents’ generation have splashed out with increasing abandon.The proportion the young spent on fuel and groceries was up two percentage points while their spending on recreation and culture was down two points, the share spend on restaurants and hotels was down one point and clothing and shoes down two points. The 65s and over spent three percentage points less on groceries, two percentage points more on restaurants and hotels and three percentage points more on recreation and culture.“The clear picture in terms of day-to-day living standards as measured through household consumption is of generational progress for older generations, and generational decline for younger ones,” the report said.A spokesman for Generation Rent, which represents young people who have been priced out of homeownership, said in response to the report that “resentment is growing” and the founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which promotes the interests of younger generations, accused older people of “breaking the social contract”.The audit also assesses sharp increases in housing costs, cuts to in-work benefits, stagnant pay since the financial 2008 financial crisis and widening gaps in absolute wealth between young and old as key factors in one of the biggest social changes of this era. Lord Willetts said it was clear that big gains in standards of living enjoyed by previous generations had stalled, but he noted that in the last couple of years there had been stronger pay growth for younger millennials.“By looking for solutions through a generational lens we can repair the social contract between generations, and help bring our country back together again,” he said.In absolute terms, young people today remain better off than baby boomers were when they were young and the report makes clear the strain on the intergenerational contract is not one way. The Office for Budget Responsibility has identified a looming £36bn annual shortfall in health, social care and pension funding because of the ageing population, which is likely to have to be filled by taxing income or inheritances.Claire Turner, a director at the Centre for Ageing Better, urged caution at framing challenges in terms of intergenerational fairness and using statistical averages “which could distract us from the very real poverty and disadvantage experienced by people across all ages”.“Many of the issues identified in this report are the result of decades of political short-termism and a failure by successive governments to respond to Britain’s changing population structure,” she said.But Angus Hanton, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said older voters have allowed policies that levied high taxes on the young, and made it hard for them to save for a pension or own their own home.“When asked to ease the pressure on the intergenerational contract by contributing a little more if they have it, older generations demand intergenerational solidarity and universal benefits for their generation, but not for others,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960c52b01fd2a80723fd02d993c3849deb100716/0_76_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=635d60a7328b31ff6de1d95f73f444a4","title":"dogs in focus in pictures photographic show battersea","story":"A selection of works at the exhibition Photographic Dog Show includes images from some of the world’s finest photographers, including Elliott Erwitt, Bruce Weber, Martin Usborne among others, who all happen to have a love of canines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e1fa9af5b5f7a63eb4dbde9fcee0d72676a048/0_70_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2482c53add377c83b52f14beca191544","title":"the rehabilitation of tony blair","story":"Tony Blair’s legacy since leaving office has been the subject of heated debate both within the Labour party and the country at large.

None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

For that reason I will do everything within my power to defend myself against any such false accusations.The TIU, however, had earlier refused to confirm or deny whether it had been asked to investigate the case, an information vacuum that did little to help López’s initial protestation of innocence.López revealed Murray “didn’t say anything” to him about the stories, adding: “This thing can happen to every one of us. He’s happy to play with me this week. I think we can play great and he’s been training normal. Andy is one of the best players in the history of tennis and I’m very lucky to be playing with him.”López also confided that he had been falsely accused in a British newspaper 16 years ago of throwing a match when he retired ill against Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of a tournament in Long Island. “I saw the article. I went to my lawyers. They had to publish another article saying that I was not involved in any match-fixing at that time.”He said of his win against Fucsovics: “It’s not easy when you find yourself in an article saying that you might be a match-fixer. But I believe that I didn’t do anything wrong, no? I have to deal with a lot of tweets regarding the issue, but I was just trying to focus on the match today. It was difficult for me to play and I’m very happy that I went through a difficult situation when I was a set and a break down and I made it.”On a day when rain again wrecked the schedule although Dan Evans did get on court and was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Stan Wawrinka, discussions switched to the wildcards Wimbledon announced for the championships, which start on 1 July. There was bemusement that Marco Baghdatis, 139 in the world, again is ushered into the main draw, but celebration for the 19-year-old Paul Jubb, of Hull.“I don’t think he was worth a wildcard,” John Lloyd said of Baghdatis, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2006 and quarter-finalist the following year. “He’s not a big enough name and what he did was a long time ago.”Jubb’s wildcard – alongside the 20-year-old Jay Clarke and evergreen James Ward – gives the British presence in the men’s draw a patina of respectability, in support of Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund and Cameron Norrie.The Hull teenager, not known widely outside the game’s hardcore, grabbed headlines briefly last month when he became the first British player to win the highest honour in American college tennis, the NCAA title. Norrie, who also played college tennis, said, “He’s solid and a good athlete with a good serve. I think it’s a hell of an achievement.”Jubb’s parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his grandmother before winning a scholarship that has transformed his young career. He will resume studies after Wimbledon and has indicated he will turn professional in May next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e288b6e94926a31c108e42c516712bc1e5a05eae/0_51_1269_761/master/1269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c10921c2f9e2e5dfb1cea9f59f4b5d57","title":"eoin morgan inspiring england cricket world cup joe root","story":"Eoin Morgan claimed his six-hitting spree against Afghanistan went beyond his wildest dreams but, for Joe Root, who watched all but one of the 17 record-breaking blows from the non-striker’s end, the captain’s assault came as no surprise.Root happily provided support to Morgan during England’s one-sided victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday, scoring 88 from 82 balls in classic fashion and contrasting style to the jaw-dropping 71-ball 148 that belied the captain’s recent back spasms.Asked if he thought Morgan had such an innings in him, Root replied: “Yes. Definitely. A lot of the time he will play in that manner, very selflessly, potentially going a little bit too hard, because he wants to set the example. He’s always been capable of doing it. It’s great to see him doing it on this stage, in a World Cup. I’m trying to find the right word to describe his innings. It was just phenomenal really, unbelievable ball striking and it completely took the game away.”Root contributed 43 to the pair’s third-wicket stand of 189 and felt his role in that situation was simply to get his partner back on strike, something he did 17 times during their 16.5 overs together at the crease.Root is the keystone to England’s batting unit – their top-scorer so far in the competition with 367 runs – and he fancies Morgan’s savage innings can truly inspire the team before Friday’s meeting with Sri Lanka at Headingley.He continued: “It’s not even like Old Trafford is a small ground. It’s a fantastic achievement, especially for someone with a dodgy back. It makes you wonder how bad it actually was. But it’s a really good sign for the group having the captain in that sort of form. It gives the dressing room a huge amount of confidence.”It is not only Morgan’s bat that has England upbeat at present. The pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood continues to trouble opponents, with the pair not only sharing 21 wickets at this World Cup but also offering significant physical threat.This was underlined by the bouncer that struck Afghanistan’s top-scorer, Hashmatullah Shahidi, on the head and broke his helmet. As well as raising questions about the ICC’s concussion protocol – Shahidi said he defied doctors orders by batting on, hoping not to worry his mother watching on TV back home – it demonstrated Morgan’s ruthless side in asking Wood to send down another bouncer immediately.Wood, who was affected by the blow but duly delivered on his captain’s orders, was keen to stress that once a batsman resumes, the tactic is entirely fair game. “I was concerned when I first hit him, it was a bit of a bad blow,” he said. “Then it’s out of my hands really, you have to let the medical staff do their thing. I checked he was all right, said ‘Are you OK’, then it was back into game mode.“Morgy wanted me to fire another few down. That’s what the captain wants, you listen to orders and now that he’s all right, it’s game time again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf19f049d6213ddc762bd0c25804f3d4466ce426/0_160_4185_2511/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce7ba1c2b62fa643da740c77e98475a","title":"new zealand south africa cricket world cup match report","story":"There are some 20 World Cup group games still to run but after New Zealand’s Kane Williamson produced an epic unbeaten 106 to overcome South Africa in a tense finale at Edgbaston, the identity of the four semi-finalists is already taking shape.Williamson’s 138-ball masterclass on a pitch that prevented risk-free shot-making was an innings for the ages. The right-hander brought up his 12th ODI century with a six that levelled the scores in the final over, before guiding a four that completed a chase of 242 with three balls and four wickets to spare.In doing so the Black Caps’ captain to all intents knocked out South Africa and dented Bangladesh’s chances of breaking the top four. With England second and fourth-placed India having a game in hand, Mashrafe Mortaza’s side must beat third-placed Australia in Nottingham on Thursday and hope further upsets can truly re-open the race for the chasing pack.South Africa will not be among them and have three games in which to play for pride. And, as has been a common theme of recent World Cup campaigns, there was a sense of what if. Chiefly this revolved around late chances to remove Williamson and Colin de Grandhomme, the burly all-rounder who crashed 60 from 47 balls, before their 91-run stand settled it.Both came in the 38th over and with the game still in the balance. Imran Tahir had bowled a fine spell of none for 33 but in the final set of six had De Grandhomme dropped on 22 by David Miller at mid-wicket – it would have been a screamer, admittedly – and then a reprieve for Williamson that proved gut-wrenching.The right-hander tried to dab a fizzing leg-break fine but failed. Tahir was convinced of a nick but Quinton de Kock, behind the stumps, and the umpire Nigel Llong were oblivious to any contact. Had the captain, Faf du Plessis, reviewed, Williamson would have departed for 76 with the faintest of edges detected.“No, we weren’t aware of it,” said Du Plessis at the end. “I think I was at long-on at the time and Quinny is the closest to the action. He’s always my go-to man. Even Kane said he didn’t know he had got a fine touch it. But that’s not the difference.”Williamson certainly was, however, with the run chase that followed South Africa’s 241 for six from a reduced 49 overs an exhibition in restraint and a captain’s knock in stark contrast to Eoin Morgan’s six-hitting spree for England 24 hours earlier.Chris Morris had bowled with heart for three wickets, reducing New Zealand to 80 for four in the 19th over and 137 for five in the 33rd, meaning there were still 105 runs to get with 100 balls remaining.While Williamson held firm at one end – he struck nine fours and one six but chiefly absorbed the pressure – De Grandhomme transcended conditions at the other, heaving some meaty blows into the Hollies Stand at the ground where he has previously turned out for Warwickshire.His bowling, after a 90-minute delay at the start, was more than useful too, with figures of one for 33 from 10 overs part of a fine stifling effort by New Zealand as South Africa’s batsmen, so low on confidence, tried their best to post a decent total.It was the pace of Lockie Ferguson that shone brightest and continued a fine World Cup, castling Du Plessis with a searing 92mph yorker for 23 and then seeing both David Miller (36) and Andile Phehlukwayo (0) caught trying to force shots late on.Trent Boult detonating De Kock’s leg-stump had made for an inauspicious start by South Africa but Hashim Amla’s 55 from 83 balls – one which made him the second fastest man after Virat Kohli to 8,000 ODI runs – steadied the ship.Amla was undone by the delicate left-arm of Mitchell Santner – a ball that dipped, spun and clipped the off-stump – and it was only Rassie van der Dussen, top-scorer with 67 not out, who offered any impetus with some late boundaries.New Zealand’s chase overcame the early loss of Colin Munro – caught and bowled by Kagiso Rabada via an inside edge on to pad – as Williamson and Martin Guptill put on 60 runs in 12.4 overs for the second wicket.Guptill, like all but De Grandhomme, was unable truly to free his arms but did pierce the in-field for five fours. His dismissal was more memorable than the innings itself, the right-hander swivelling 360 degrees when trying to pull Phehlukwayo, only to slip and kick the leg-stump with his back foot.Further fortune was to be found when Ross Taylor clipped an innocuous ball from Morris to De Kock down the leg side.The bowler looked slightly embarrassed but there was little doubt about the follow-up, a ball that jagged off the surface and snicked the edge of Tom Latham’s bat for a more classical caught behind.Morris returned in the 33rd over to have Jimmy Neesham caught at slip on 23. But with the new man, De Grandhomme, in no mood to muck about and Williamson ice-cool, New Zealand found their way home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a42a0a6dd204e818dcbc637c0a17397e858208/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ff2858bd4cec1536543e19fece5d0d3","title":"world rugby nations championship rugby union","story":"Global rugby union is braced for fresh turmoil after the governing body announced it had discontinued plans to introduce a Nations Championship for the leading Test nations. World Rugby said it had taken the decision after the proposal failed to gain the unanimous support of key powerbrokers.Scheduled to launch in 2022, the Nations Championship was intended to revitalise traditional tours with a new tournament in which the top 12 teams from both hemispheres would play each other annually with the two top sides contesting a final. But from the outset more than one Six Nations union was resistant to the prospect of promotion and relegation and leading players also expressed strong reservations.There was also uproar when one draft proposal which excluded the Pacific Island nations was leaked, but World Rugby has now conceded the entire project is dead. “Despite strong progress in collaboration with unions, competition owners and international rugby players, including full engagement on the detailed process of financial due diligence, a lack of consensus on key issues, particularly the timing and format of promotion and relegation, left World Rugby with no alternative but to discontinue the project,” read a statement.While the news was not wholly unexpected Sir Bill Beaumont, World Rugby’s chairman, clearly feels a rare opportunity to unite the game’s assorted factions has been missed. “World Rugby undertook this important project with the best interests of the global game at heart in line with our vision to grow the sport as a game for all,” he said.“While we are naturally disappointed that a unanimous position on the Nations Championship could not be achieved among our unions, we remain fully committed to exploring alternative ways to enhance the meaning, value and opportunity of international rugby for the betterment of all unions.” Beaumont also confirmed that expanding the 2027 Rugby World Cup to 24 teams remained a possibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e052a2c12e44a9086e69e8de15a871d93f9c60/0_149_4311_2587/master/4311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f9ad900a609c420b589b8fcaf2ad41","title":"australia v bangladesh cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Hello and welcome.

As she appears in a Noël Coward comedy, the actor talks about her dreams of returning to mime – and why sticking with her name may have hurt her career‘People always talk about that scream,” says Indira Varma over salad and strawberries at the Old Vic theatre. The actor is recalling the howl she lets out in season four of Game of Thrones, after her lover Oberyn has his eyes gouged out by a hulking brute called the Mountain. Splatter flies and we cut to her character, Ellaria, who gives a blood-curdling screech.What personal demons, I wonder, was Varma summoning to produce that? “It was the last thing they shot that day,” she recalls. “I had one go. We were losing the light. So it’s like…” She draws a breath and drags out an expletive until her voice squeaks. Then she says with a shrug: “You have to deliver.”Varma, who has triumphed in Shakespeare, Shaw, Pinter and Hare, is now starring in Noël Coward’s Present Laughter at the London theatre. But she’s still best known as ruthless Ellaria, who we first meet embarking on a foursome with Oberyn and is usually to be seen writhing at his side, or scheming with her Sand Snake daughters.In Matthew Warchus’s production of Coward’s 1939 comedy, Andrew Scott dons theatre’s most famous dressing gown to play the tousled matinee idol Garry Essendine. Varma is Liz, who never got round to orcing Garry and manages his career with utmost pragmatism. This involves navigating his dalliances with debutantes and, in a fresh gender-switch, with predatory male actor Joe (Joanna in Coward’s original).Coolheaded, elegant, shrewd: there’s a hint of Liz to Varma, who illustrates points with gestures placed as carefully as her words are chosen. “Liz is the one person who is direct with Garry, so he values that relationship. He is pulled in every direction by flattery and adulation. The thing about Liz that I love is she walked away from the marriage. She’s really powerful.”This is Varma’s second Coward – she did The Vortex at the Donmar in 2002. I presume she saw his plays growing up in well-heeled Bath? Apparently not. “But I used to queue up for the Theatre Royal because they did £1 standing room tickets. I saw Lettice and Lovage with Maggie Smith. It blew my mind.” What else excited her? “People laugh but I love mime. I feel sad because I’ve kind of let it go.” Her career took her through different doors, she says. I picture Varma shutting out Marcel Marceau in a sad little mime. She might find a way back in, she insists – “a cat flap into that world”.Varma, who is 45, was raised in an arty home by her Swiss mother (a graphic designer) and Indian father (an illustrator). Were they keen on her having an acting career? “My dad wasn’t. He’d just throw at me, ‘You should be a doctor.’ Utterly ludicrous. I was crap at science.” She went off to Rada. How was that? After a slight sigh, she talks instead about the fun of acting as a child: “There’s something so pure about being able to mess about, where there are no expectations.” She then remembers Rada as “great but quite intimidating”. There is a pause. “We all go through moments of self-doubt and going, ‘I’m the mistake.’ Or, ‘Maybe I’m not right for this. I don’t fit into what I think the theatre world is. I’m not useful to that world yet.’ To begin with, I felt like that.”She graduated in 1995 and Mira Nair cast her as a servant turned courtesan in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, inspired by the ancient Hindu text. Nair was impressed by her “wilful gaze and imperiousness” and the film, shot in central India, was a “baptism of fire” says Varma. At 21, she hadn’t trained for film nor grown up on movies. Here she was debuting in a leading role requiring considerable nudity. “It was the first time I had to lose weight. I’d prided myself on being me – take me as I am! But the reality is that you’re there to serve the material. Suddenly you’re having to change yourself a little to fit this ideal.” She lost confidence and grew angry. But did she have a lot of trust in Nair as a director? “Yeah – and as a woman,” she says.I ask if Kama Sutra narrowed the roles she was offered. “Oh God, yeah,” she says twice. “My name’s Indira Varma. It’s an Indian name. And I think, you know, if I had a Spanish name, people would maybe think I was Spanish. If I had a North African name, also. If I had an English name, I might be seen differently.” At drama school, one teacher suggested she change it but she thought: “I’m going to forge a path for those with foreign names!” Another encouraged her to keep it. “I’ve always been torn by that decision. I’m still in the business and I’m here at the Old Vic, but there have been moments where I’ve thought: bloody hell, I’ve missed out on that because actually they liked the tape and then someone went, ‘Bit too Asian – not really what we’re looking for.’”At Rada, Varma had been cast as an old man – “and as a parrot!” But after Kama Sutra, she says, “all I was being offered was Indian exotica, women who take their clothes off”. She concentrated on theatre, playing Phoebe in As You Like It (opposite Stephen Mangan) and Bianca in Othello (directed by Sam Mendes). She had the distinction of not just doing Pinter but also starring with and being directed by the great playwright. She does an impressive Pinter impersonation, recreating his words of advice: “Nothing you do is wrong.” She laughs and explains he wasn’t talking “to me personally, daaarling! But if you are truthful, then nothing you do is wrong. That is the most liberating thing you can say to an actor.”Back on screen, Varma was a hoot in matching Burberry cap and bikini in Bride and Prejudice, Gurinder Chadha’s Bollywood Austen makeover, looking on aloof in the Caroline Bingley role. On telly, in the satirical Broken News, she was newsreader Melanie Bellamy, frantically pacing around a studio. In Luther, she played humanitarian lawyer Zoe, whose grace contrasts with her explosive detective husband (Idris Elba). She was superb in Patrick Melrose, too, wracked with concern for Melrose’s mother Eleanor as they share a Ferris wheel.This summer, she appears in Official Secrets, a film about GCHQ whistleblower Katharine Gun. She plays Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of Liberty who invited Varma to tea at the House of Lords. “I look nothing like her,” she says, “and she’s half my size.” Varma has just done a TV pilot, For Life, playing a gay prison warden. Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is involved. “He’s done some music for it!” she laughs. “Really cool!”Her industry, Varma says, requires actors to be Teflon on the outside but able to access their vulnerabilities in performance. “It’s a paradox.” She aspires to something similar when performing: “I’m in control of it but also not giving a fuck, so anything can happen. That tension is what it’s all about.” Does she carry characters around with her during rehearsals? “Prior to having a child, it was all-consuming.” Now Varma has a daughter with actor Colin Tierney, she switches off more easily – although they’ve been telling her to stop talking so loudly, reminding her she’s not on the Old Vic stage yet.Several Thrones stars are doing theatre in London this summer: Gwendoline Christie is playing Titania, Julian Glover is doing Tennessee Williams, Faye Marsay is at the Donmar. Did she meet many of the TV juggernaut’s huge cast? “When I came in, in season four, our storyline had a wedding which meant everybody was there. It was really lovely.” What did her audition require? “I just had to, like, prowl around a little bit.” An actor friend had randomly emailed to ask why she wasn’t in the show. Varma thought: “Yeah, why am I not?” She emailed another friend who worked on it and got the audition.Why is it so popular? She talks about clever storytelling, power struggles, then admits: “Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t watched the whole thing to be honest.” But she praises the Shakespearean richness in how characters contradict themselves. Varma’s real Shakespeares include a Titus Andronicus at the Globe that supposedly had audiences fainting. “Often they didn’t pass out in the gory bits,” she says. “The language is sort of more shocking.”She remembers doing Twelfth Night and the power of Andrew Aguecheek’s “I was adored once too” line. “They call it a heart-stopping line. At both the matinee and the evening, a person had a heart attack in that scene. Somebody who’s a bit of a fool, who says stupid things, suddenly has one line that is profound. I did The Vertical Hour with David Hare. He said if you want to say something important, make a joke beforehand. I think Coward does that.”Present Laughter’s title comes from Twelfth Night. Coward’s play was first called Sweet Sorrow but that was considered too gloomy for a wartime audience. “I think Matthew is trying to go for the Sweet Sorrow version,” says Varma before breaking out in a smile: “But there’s definitely laughter!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a367e6a64395b1dd39af9a5a84e822f2f10f753/306_670_3666_2199/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79a92e200a325568a38ff548c85ed63","title":"wheres the cheapest place to store 500gb of data online","story":"Reeling from a Dropbox price hike, Kate wants somewhere cheaper to store her 500GB of photos and filesI’ve just received notification that my Dropbox account is going up in price to more than £90 a year. I like Dropbox’s interface and ease of use from the mobile app, but £90 seems steep for what I require. What cheaper options do I have for securely storing about 500GB of photos and files? KateMost of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can’t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second – very sensible – reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you’re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it’s easy to get into them but hard to get out.In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that’s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can’t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.Dropbox has increased its starting price to £95.88 a year, which is £7.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (£158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It’s still competitive with other leading services that usually don’t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.Google One, as it’s now called, charges £7.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of £79.99 a year. At that price, I’d stay with Dropbox. It’s better.At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for £3.59 a month or £42.99 a year, and 2TB for £7.99 a month or £84.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of £160 (usually £430) or 2TB for £320 (usually £850). I’ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files – each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB – and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That’s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that’s optional.Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand – internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they’re an increasingly attractive alternative.All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you’re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.Have you got a question?

Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

LGBT critics such as RuPaul have suggested the show fails to capture the concept of “camp” and I generally agree. Nonetheless, it’s a great opportunity to see the fun, extravagant side of the Costume Institute’s amazing collection. Also, the show includes a great display of art and objects from LGBT history, including Pennington’s portrait – the only full portrait – of Oscar Wilde, and Paul Cadmus’s often-discussed but rarely seen The Fleet’s In!, with its scandal-rousing scene of mixed gay and straight cruising in 1930s New York.The show Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989 is spread over two spaces: work from the 1970s is at the world’s only museum of LGBT art, the Leslie-Lohman Museum (suggested admission $10, until 21 July), while art from the 1980s is at NYU’s Grey Art Gallery (suggested admission $5, until 20 July). The show clearly sets artworks in the context of the fight for LGBTQ rights and changing concepts of sexuality and gender. Highlights include David Hockney’s unusual portrait of Divine, a Bachardy charcoal sketch of the dying Christopher Isherwood, a great collection of Boston school photographs, and pictures by and of Keith Haring (I especially like an Annie Leibovitz shot of Haring nude and body-painted by himself).The New York Public Library’s Love and Resistance: Stonewall 50 (until 13 July) exhibition features archival material from the period around the Stonewall uprising. Photographs by lesbian activists Kay Lahusen and Diana Davies are the unifying theme but there are also other photos such as Fred W McDarrah’s iconic shot of Stonewall’s strikingly erse patrons. The ephemera are particularly touching, such as a Gay Liberation Front newsletter from 1970, asking readers to send suggestions about commemorating the Stonewall uprising to Craig Rodwell, one of the organisers of the first Gay Pride march.The Lesbian Herstory Archives (484 14th Street), in Brooklyn’s original “lesbian” neighbourhood of Park Slope has thousands of archival items, memorabilia and artefacts from the city’s lesbian history and culture that will help visitors gain insight into the evolution of the community. It is free to visit but check the opening times, which change month to month. Group tours are available but should be booked in advance.Restaurants Via Carota, Buvette, and the newly opened Bar Pisellino (all in Grove Street, West Village) are owned by the astoundingly successful couple Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who have bought their passion for – and knowledge of – authentic French and Italian cooking to the West Village with these three classy establishments. Via Carota’s green salad was described as the best in the world by chef and writer Samin Nosrat in the New York Times, while the “near genius” Manhattan served at Buvette is the best in the city, according to grubstreet.The Bureau of General Services – Queer Division (208 West 13th Street, until 15 September), at the LGBTQ Center, is my favourite queer bookstore in NYC with a great selection of ’zines and artist books. Make sure you check out the Bureau’s Y’all Better Quiet Down, a group exhibition of art and ephemera in response to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising curated by Nelson Santos.At the Brooklyn Museum, the Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall exhibition (until 8 December) explores the profound legacy of the Stonewall uprisings within contemporary art and visual culture today. The show masterfully embodies queerness at its most fluid and expansive, bringing together the voices of 28 artists born after 1969 whose artworks look at the past in search for mirrors to their own queer identities, while projecting a more nuanced and intersectional future. In the heart of the West Village is Julius’ (159 West 10th Street), the city’s oldest standing gay bar, where the famous Sip-In took place. The 1966 action by the Mattachine Society challenged bars and restaurants that refused to serve alcohol to homosexuals, a common practice at the time. Go for the happy hour (every day from 4pm-9pm) and stay for the comfort food.Take a voguing class (single class $17, held twice weekly from 6pm), at the Gibney Dance studios on Broadway with Jason Anthony Rodriguez, aka Slim Ninja. Vogue is a form of self-expression in which striking elegant poses elevates your confidence and, most importantly, yourself. After body-conditioning and stretching you will find exercises and combinations that weave together key voguing elements such as arms control, runway, cat walk, duck walk, and dips.Alice Austen House on Staten Island was the home of the prolific and pioneering photographer where, rebelling against Victorian mores, she lived with her partner, Gertrude Tate. The museum houses a permanent collection of Austen’s work, with documentary photos capturing city life in the late 1800s and early 1900s, sitting with early images of women dressed in male drag. There are also exhibitions of other photographers’ work – the current exhibition, Stonewall at 50 (until 30 September), includes portraits of 15 intergenerational LGBTQ+ activists and artists by Collier Schorr. (Museum entrance is a $5 suggested donation).Another special exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, Pride: Photographs of Stonewall and Beyond, is on at the Museum of the City of New York (until 31 December, $18). It is made up of a wealth of images by Fred W McDarrah, former staff photographer for the Village Voice, who worked at the liberal US news and culture paper for more than five decades. The show includes photographs of the initial Stonewall uprising, intimate portraits of significant people in the LGBTQ rights movement, and images of pride marches, protests and other public LGBTQ events.Dance bands from around the world bring a glorious open-air party to Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park for the annual Midsummer Night’s Swing, with events every night until 13 July. It’s one of the city’s largest outdoor dance events, and has been running since 1988, and includes different live acts each night playing swing, salsa, R\u0026ampB, disco and tango, alongside DJs, dance instructors and a late-night silent disco.Bayard Rustin’s Residence was the home of the key strategist in the civil and gay rights movements. He was a proponent of nonviolent protest, a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr, and a lead organiser of the landmark 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He lived at the Chelsea apartment from 1962 to 1987, and a plaque outside now honours his life and work, including the famous quote: “We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers.” For more on this, there is a Making Gay History episode from 2016 featuring an interview with his partner Walter Naegle, and a 1986 recording of an interview between Bayard and Peg Byron, who was writing for the DC-based gay newspaper the Washington Blade.Mood Ring is a gay bar in Bushwick on Myrtle Avenue, a few steps away from tropical-themed party venue Bossa Nova Civics Club. I’ve hosted my queer Caribbean party “No Badmind” at Mood Ring and the uplifting energy and inclusiveness is what keeps me coming back. The drinks list features astrology-themed cocktails ($11) and this is definitely my go-to spot for a good late night.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one – Amazon’s Good Omens – functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary.I have to admit that I didn’t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid’s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22’s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls’ 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best. A similar fate of smug, too wacky mediocrity seemed inevitable.And yet somehow they have pulled it off. The Catch-22 series is successful in almost every way. It is beautifully shot, thoughtfully written and incredibly well acted. It takes plenty of liberties with Joseph Heller’s book – there are approximately 25 fewer characters, almost no flashbacks and the ending is entirely different – but, having seen the series, I have come to the conclusion that these changes are exactly what make it sing.I’ll try to stay clear of spoiler territory, but the biggest decision made by the film-makers was to break the book apart and put it back together in the right order. The book hops about all over the place, leaping from viewpoint to viewpoint and back and forth through time. It’s a terrific sleight-of-hand – when Heller decides to fill in the blanks caused by this literary restlessness, it comes as a punch in the guts – but it would have made for an incredibly annoying TV show.Instead, the series takes its time to wear down its protagonist, bombardier John Yossarian (Christopher Abbott). His downfall is parcelled out carefully along the way, and each new attempt to escape his fate brings about new and awful consequences. By the time he is finally broken, it has a feeling of inevitability that wasn’t present in the novel. It also reinforces the notion that Yossarian is a classic antihero, rather than a sane innocent trapped in a world of madness. Every time he tries to wriggle free of his commitments, he causes something terrible to happen to someone else. When this happened in the book, everything was rationalised through prose. Without that safety net, Yossarian quite often just comes off as a dick. Perversely, this makes him a little easier to understand.Speaking of prose, another smart decision was to avoid Heller’s tone as often as possible. The book is a smashed Rubik’s cube, full of repetition, circular reasoning and busted logic. All the characters are trapped by their own thought patterns, which is fun to read but – as anyone who has watched every episode of the tonally similar W1A can attest – can be brutal to sit through. It still happens here and there, so the doctor’s explanation of insanity is thankfully still intact, but it isn’t quite as punishing. Stripping the plot back and rebuilding it in the shape of a classic drama feels like a something of a masterstroke.Especially compared with Good Omens, which suffered enormously from how faithful it was to the book. I don’t know anyone, aside from those falling within the very highest percentile of Terry Pratchett fandom, who didn’t groan in despair when Amazon’s adaptation opened with several minutes of arch narration over what seemed to be a deliberate copy of QI’s opening titles. Catch-22, less in thrall to its fans, is much more confident in its ability to take on a new shape, and this makes it far easier to watch.It also feels more open-ended, as if Hulu has already entertained the idea of lengthening the series out beyond the source material. Let’s hope that the failure of the last two Handmaid’s Tale seasons is enough to put them off. However, if this was always intended to be a finite six-episode retelling, then Catch-22 might just go down as the first time that anyone has successfully filmed an unfilmable novel.Catch-22 airs Thursdays, 9pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5715cb70afbe316403cfab0bcbcc69db573fee45/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b18ac7c6fcc5cbab4d33b71125def9","title":"donna haraway interview cyborg manifesto post truth","story":"Cyborg Manifesto author and philosopher who explores the nature of reality discusses the science wars and climate activismThe history of philosophy is also a story about real estate.Driving into Santa Cruz to visit Donna Haraway, I can’t help feeling that I was born too late. The metal sculpture of a donkey standing on Haraway’s front porch, the dogs that scramble to her front door barking when we ring the bell, and the big black rooster strutting in the coop out back – the entire setting evokes an era of freedom and creativity that postwar wealth made possible in northern California.Here was a counterculture whose language and sensibility the tech industry sometimes adopts, but whose practitioners it has mostly priced out. Haraway, who came to the University of Santa Cruz in 1980 to take up the first tenured professorship in feminist theory in the US, still conveys the sense of a wide-open world.Haraway was part of an influential cohort of feminist scholars who trained as scientists before turning to the philosophy of science in order to investigate how beliefs about gender shaped the production of knowledge about nature. Her most famous text remains The Cyborg Manifesto, published in 1985. It began with an assignment on feminist strategy for the Socialist Review after the election of Ronald Reagan and grew into an oracular meditation on how cybernetics and digitization had changed what it meant to be male or female – or, really, any kind of person. It gained such a cult following that Hari Kunzru, profiling her for Wired magazine years later, wrote: “To boho twentysomethings, her name has the kind of cachet usually reserved for techno acts or new phenethylamines.”The cyborg vision of gender as changing and changeable was radically new. Her map of how information technology linked people around the world into new chains of affiliation, exploitation, and solidarity feels prescient at a time when an Instagram influencer in Berlin can line the pockets of Silicon Valley executives by using a phone assembled in China that contains cobalt mined in Congo to access a platform moderated by Filipinas.Haraway’s other most influential text may be an essay that appeared a few years later, on what she called “situated knowledges”. The idea, developed in conversation with feminist philosophers and activists such as Nancy Hartsock, concerns how truth is made. Concrete practices of particular people make truth, Haraway argued. The scientists in a laboratory don’t simply observe or conduct experiments on a cell, for instance, but co-create what a cell is by seeing, measuring, naming and manipulating it. Ideas like these have a long history in American pragmatism. But they became politically explosive during the so-called science wars of the 1990s – a series of public debates among “scientific realists” and “postmodernists” with echoes in controversies about bias and objectivity in academia today. Haraway’s more recent work has turned to human-animal relations and the climate crisis. She is a capacious yes, and thinker, the kind of leftist feminist who believes that the best thinking is done collectively. She is constantly citing other people, including graduate students, and giving credit to them. A recent documentary about her life and work by the Italian film-maker Fabrizio Terranova, Storytelling for Earthly Survival, captures this sense of commitment, as well as her extraordinary intellectual agility and inventiveness. At her home in Santa Cruz, we talked about her memories of the science wars and how they speak to our current “post-truth” moment, her views on contemporary climate activism and the Green New Deal, and why play is essential for politics.We are often told we are living in a time of “post-truth”. Some critics have blamed philosophers like yourself for creating the environment of “relativism” in which “post-truth” flourishes. How do you respond to that?Our view was never that truth is just a question of which perspective you see it from. Anyhow. We were at this conference. It was a bunch of primate field biologists, plus me and Bruno. And Stephen Glickman, a really cool biologist, took us apart privately. He said: “Now, I don’t want to embarrass you. But do you believe in reality?”We were both kind of shocked by the question. First, we were shocked that it was a question of belief, which is a Protestant question. A confessional question. The idea that reality is a question of belief is a barely secularized legacy of the religious wars. In fact, reality is a matter of worlding and inhabiting. It is a matter of testing the holdingness of things. Do things hold or not?Take evolution. The notion that you would or would not “believe” in evolution already gives away the game. If you say, “Of course I believe in evolution,” you have lost, because you have entered the semiotics of representationalism – and post-truth, frankly. You have entered an arena where these are all just matters of internal conviction and have nothing to do with the world. You have left the domain of worlding.The science warriors who attacked us during the science wars were determined to paint us as social constructionists – that all truth is purely socially constructed. And I think we walked into that. We invited those misreadings in a range of ways. We could have been more careful about listening and engaging more slowly. It was all too easy to read us in the way the science warriors did. Then the rightwing took the science wars and ran with it, which eventually helped nourish the whole fake-news discourse.Your PhD is in biology. How do your scientist colleagues feel about your approach to science?To this day I know only one or two scientists who like talking this way. And there are good reasons why scientists remain very wary of this kind of language. I belong to the Defend Science movement and in most public circumstances I will speak softly about my own ontological and epistemological commitments. I will use representational language. I will defend less-than-strong objectivity because I think we have to, situationally.In the struggles around climate change, for example, you have to join with your allies to block the cynical, well-funded, exterminationist machine that is rampant on the Earth. I think my colleagues and I are doing that. We have not shut up, or given up on the apparatus that we developed. But one can foreground and background what is most salient depending on the historical conjuncture.What do you find most salient at the moment?What is at the center of my attention are land and water sovereignty struggles, such as those over the Dakota Access pipeline, over coal mining on the Black Mesa plateau, over extractionism everywhere. My attention is centered on the extermination and extinction crises happening at a worldwide level, on human and non-human displacement and homelessness. That’s where my energies are. My feminism is in these other places and corridors.What kind of political tactics do you see as being most important – for young climate activists, the Green New Deal, etc?Now, we are facing a world with all three of those things. We are facing the production of systemic homelessness. The way that flowers aren’t blooming at the right time, and so insects can’t feed their babies and can’t travel because the timing is all screwed up, is a kind of forced homelessness. It’s a kind of forced migration, in time and space.So it’s not a humanist question. It’s a multi-kind and multi-species question.What’s so important about play?Play captures a lot of what goes on in the world. There is a kind of raw opportunism in biology and chemistry, where things work stochastically to form emergent systematicities. It’s not a matter of direct functionality. We need to develop practices for thinking about those forms of activity that are not caught by functionality, those which propose the possible-but-not-yet, or that which is not-yet but still open.It seems to me that our politics these days require us to give each other the heart to do just that. To figure out how, with each other, we can open up possibilities for what can still be. And we can’t do that in a negative mood. We can’t do that if we do nothing but critique. We need critique we absolutely need it. But it’s not going to open up the sense of what might yet be. It’s not going to open up the sense of that which is not yet possible but profoundly needed.The established disorder of our present era is not necessary. It exists. But it’s not necessary.A longer version of this conversation will appear in a forthcoming issue of Logic, a magazine about technology.

Leading campaigners on how to look after yourself before heading back into the frayEvery week it seems there is something new to protest about. If we are now in the Anthropocene age – where human effects on the globe take precedence over nature – we are also in the age of activism, one of protesting against our damaging impact on the world. This dissent has moved beyond the fringes of political engagement to packing our streets with people and placards bearing slogans that range from seeking to stave off climate change to stopping Donald Trump and staying in the EU. Protests are increasingly taking in wider age ranges and demographics, too, but for those grassroots organisers for whom this is a long-term mission, the toll of such responsibility can be a heavy one.Activism comes with all the stresses of any job – long hours, “office” politics and overflowing inboxes. Couple this with the fact that activism is in a sense defined by its marginality and the job sits firmly between a rock and a hard place. How, then, do activists stay motivated when the odds are against them?Bill McKibben, environmentalist and author“Try to spend a little time outdoors, whether it is in a city park or out in the woods or mountains. One of the things we are fighting for is a world where nature still has some place and so it’s good to get out and remind ourselves of that. I try to get outside every day, just for a few minutes. If I can just see the sky, that’s good sometimes I only want to see the stars for a few minutes and that makes me feel worthwhile.”Eve Ensler, playwright and feminist activist“It is important to realise that the struggle is long, so you have to take care of your body. You have to have pleasure, joy and humour in your life, otherwise you just become bitter and full of sadness. Nature is critical, dance is critical, sex is critical.“Pleasure is what fuels us. Sometimes when we are doing this work, it can feel like we are not allowed to feel anything but pain, yet having done this work for a long time, if you want to keep going you need to have joy, as that’s what will keep you motivated to go back.”Bisi Alimi, LGBT activist“I can get a lot of online abuse for the work that I do, as well as often seeing a lot of trauma from fellow LGBT people who reach out to me. That used to give me very intense anxiety. I have started going to the gym regularly for my mental health and sometimes, when I am really angry, I will go to a boxing class, which helps me get it out of my system. This allows me to see whatever has upset me less personally. I go to the gym five times a week and I also run at least twice a week, so every day I am doing something active that allows me to disconnect.”Harry Gay, founder of Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants“Anger is an important motivator and it is important we don’t shy away from it as a driver for change. It is natural to be angry about the state of the world and at the things we see that are unjust. We’re often told that anger is a negative emotion and that we should shy away from it perhaps interpersonally that is true, but on a structural level it is important to not get sad about what is happening around you but to get angry and then to channel it in the right way, through action. That is what keeps us going and fighting for migrant rights and for all those who are discriminated against we cannot get despondent.”Patrisse Cullors, founder of Black Lives Matter“I’m a big proponent of therapy and always tell activists and organisers that they should be seeing a therapist to get them through. We are on the frontlines hearing so many painful stories from so many people that we become therapists ourselves, but we are not trained, so it creates an unfortunate environment for burnout.“I have been doing activism since I was 16 years old, but I soon found out that it was triggering difficult memories from my childhood and was having an impact on how I saw myself – I couldn’t separate myself from the people I was organising. I have been doing this for 20 years now and the only reason I have been able to do it for so long is because I have been relying on other people’s skill sets to help me take care of myself and be a better person.“People forget that activists are human beings and that there is a lot at stake for us. Often we do this work because it’s what we have experienced ourselves.”Gina Miller, anti-Brexit campaigner and lobbyist“What can stop me in my tracks are those who attack my family and do it premeditatively, those who rant to my children, put it in an envelope and send it to my address. To get a letter which says, ‘We know where your children are, we’ll be taking them today,’ is truly shocking.“When that happens, I have to cry and let it out because you can’t hold it all in. There is a temptation that as activists we have to be strong all the time, but in private you have to look after yourself and let your emotions come out when they arise. I will cry it out, I will hug my family and then refocus on what I am doing and get ready to keep going again. I will take the negative energy and redirect it into something positive.”Miqdaad Versi, anti-Islamophobia campaigner“My parents sacrificed so much as immigrants coming to this country and working all hours to send me to a private school, which they thought would give me the best chance in life. While I might not agree with private schools as an institution, I understand how important it was for my parents that I succeed in life, so I have a responsibility to them to not only do well but to stand up for others like them and to make society a better place for everyone.“I have been lucky that my parents worked so hard for me and that means I can and should take the time to continue my activism. Knowing what they went through pales in comparison to my struggles and that keeps me going.”Owen Jones,  columnist and activist“It is important to feel that you are part of a broader movement for justice and that you are not just some isolated inidual in fear. I spend a lot of time with LGBT activists, socialists, feminists and anti-racism activists, and this reminds me that I am part of a collective struggle. The attacks I receive aren’t personal and I am not the only person who gets them – these people just hate the things we are fighting for and believe in. It should never become background noise but, equally, I wouldn’t want to be intimidated by it because that would be giving them a victory they don’t deserve. We have to maintain our solidarity in the face of the far right.”Lucy Gavaghan, 17, environmental campaigner“You have to realise that, as one person, you can’t change everything and do it all. If you start feeling guilty that you are not doing all the right things it can really set you back and mean that you are not making progress. You need to give yourself time to step back from your cause and what you are fighting for because then, when you go back to it, you are ready and not exhausted.“In a way, school work can be a good way to step back and it doesn’t become too pressurised if I stay on top of it. Through the campaigning I can keep a wider perspective on changing the world and through school I can also focus on my own future.”Sam Knights, Extinction Rebellion“Finding people to talk to and support you is incredibly important. I cannot describe the huge emotional weight that was lifted for me when I first felt comfortable talking about the climate crisis and how that was affecting my mental health. It’s easy to feel like we are alone but there are thousands of people who feel like this and they want to talk to you, too. So please, as a first step, start talking to people about it.”Ryan Hart, domestic abuse campaigner“My brother Luke and I campaign against domestic abuse because our mother and sister Charlotte were killed by our father. That means that we spend all day speaking about our trauma. It gets very emotional. However, the dogs that we share have really helped us. They have shown us how to live in the moment and they are always happy as long as we are there. Luke and I were at university for most of the dogs’ early years and Mum and Charlotte were the ones who raised them. The dogs have mannerisms which remind me of them and it keeps their memory alive.”Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, cook and environmental campaigner“I have a cold shower every morning to wake me up and get me going. I have a blast of cold water for a minute or two and that is a real shock to the system when you first start, but it helps you go through the day with a spring in your step. It’s almost like the worst thing that could happen to you all day has already happened. It’s never a pleasant feeling when that cold water comes down, but you always feel so much better for having done it. No matter how hard things have been in the days before, that cold water is a ‘reset’ it means each day starts anew.”Ash Sarkar, journalist and activist“I quite enjoy that feeling of sparring with someone online. It is a reclamation of your agency. Twitter is also a little crucible for comedy it trains the bit of your brain that puts together things that are incongruous or funny.“It is important to remember that a lot of activists aren’t at the sharp end of this politics. We are leading relatively comfortable and protected lives and the people who are on the frontlines live in fear and can’t speak up for themselves. The thing that makes me feel a great sense of purpose and political will is that these people have never stopped fighting or organising because they don’t have the luxury of giving up – it is a fight for survival. If they can do it, so can I – even on Twitter.”Aderonke Apata, LGBT activist, founder of African Rainbow Family“Each time we think we have tackled an issue, another one rears its ugly head. There is no way that I or any other activist in the world can solve all of its problems, but we have to keep sight of the small victories those are the ones that keep us going.“If any of the people we work with get granted asylum, it is a huge victory for me and shows us that we are doing good. Although there is a lot that we still need to change, it gives me satisfaction that we are moving in the right direction. We need to remember to celebrate that small step towards disrupting the whole system.”Farhana Yamin, human rights lawyer and environmentalist“I didn’t watch the Channel 4 report on me getting arrested for gluing my hands outside the Shell building for weeks, until my daughter said it had got more than 1m views. I started reading the comments online and the majority were positive, but there were lots that were very offensive and rude. However, it did make me realise that for every nasty comment, there are many more constructive ones, supporting the cause and pushing me to do better. Even though there is never enough time to read and respond to everything, I want to make the conscious choice to engage as much as possible as that is the only way to keep going. We need to encourage discussion within the movement – and with the public who might be against us.”Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement“Our work as activists can be incredibly challenging and personal you have enormous responsibilities to speak up for those who have been victimised and abused. Yet, of course you can’t speak for everyone and all causes, and that can make you feel incredibly guilty. It is important, then, to remember that the arc of progress is long and that we have to pick our battles, to stand up for what we believe in and who we speak for. If you try to do everything at once, you just won’t be able to succeed.”Robin Morgan, poet and radical feminist“I look around me to stay motivated. People need to do something active and positive, however small. Write a letter, send an email. Picket, march, protest, sign a petition, sit in. Join a group and multiply your effect. Run for office. Say what you actually think. You can’t wring your hands and roll up your sleeves at the same time, so do something – and right away you will feel better. So will the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de553a1cf46efb3f03d4dd0a7bb693d0dd4b7149/0_227_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1de98426c9847524ebcbb26b9502e0e8","title":"former interpol chief meng hongwei put on trial for bribery in china","story":"Meng vanished in September during a visit to China from his home in LyonFormer Interpol chief Meng Hongwei has been put on trial for bribery, according to Chinese state media.Official government mouthpiece the People’s Daily claimed Meng had admitted his guilt during a court hearing on Thursday after prosecutors accused him of taking 14.5 million yuan ($2.11m) in bribes.Forced confessions, which are often televised, have become a hallmark of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s increasingly hardline rule.The paper said the court, in the northern city of Tianjin, would announce its verdict at a later date.It is not clear who Meng’s lawyer is and it was not possible to reach him or a legal representative for comment. His wife, who has been granted asylum in France, has said the charges against him are politically motivated.Meng vanished in September during a visit to China from his home in Lyon, France.In a statement in early October, the Chinese authorities admitted they were holding Meng and China’s ministry of public security said that he was being investigated for accepting bribes.“The inspection and investigation of Meng Hongwei … is very timely, totally right, and very wise,” it said in a statement on its website.Claiming Meng, who is Chinese, “only had himself to blame”, the ministry added: “There is no exception in front of the law. Anyone will be strictly investigated and punished.”Interpol said on Monday it “regretted” China’s move.Meng was formerly China’s deputy minister of public security, a position which critics say gave him control over the country’s secret police, and has also previously served as director of the coastguard and deputy head of the Chinese state oceanic administration.The first Chinese leader of Interpol, which connects the law enforcement agencies of its 192 member countries, Meng was elected the organisation’s head in November 2016, replacing French police officer Mireille Ballestrazzi, and was due to serve until 2020.More to follow …Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2257f290748139bf807967847b7f8313b78d6c38/0_41_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4067452f7ceaa7776b9506cf1e70a7a1","title":"thursday briefing baby boomers splurge as young adults struggle","story":"‘Generational progress for older generations, decline for younger ones’ … loss of Himalayan glaciers accelerates … and online porn age checks delayedHello, Warren Murray here, let’s get stuck into it.Claire Turner, a director at the Centre for Ageing Better, urged caution, blaming “decades of political short-termism and a failure by successive governments to respond to Britain’s changing population structure”. But a spokesman for Generation Rent said “resentment is growing” and the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation accused older people of “breaking the social contract”.

Four people go into this morning’s latest vote of MPs: Johnson, the favourite, followed by Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid. Wednesday saw Rory Stewart knocked out. After a YouGov poll of Conservative party members found they are willing to lose Scotland and Northern Ireland from the union and accept “significant” economic damage to bring about Brexit, Hammond, the chancellor, is to say he will fight for an outcome that “protects the union and the prosperity of the United Kingdom”. Johnson’s backers are saying that in the final vote by party members they would prefer to face Hunt, rather than Gove, who triggered Johnson’s exit from the 2016 leadership race. But they are being warned any tactical voting operation against Gove, like the one that eliminated Dominic Raab, would “go down very badly with Tory MPs and members”. After Johnson failed on the BBC to guarantee Brexit by 31 October, members of the ERG group of hard Brexiter Tory MPs have warned the frontrunner that not sticking to the leave date will earn him the same fate as Theresa May, “only a lot quicker”.Global heating devours glaciers – The Himalayas have lost more than a quarter of glacial ice lost over the last four decades, scientists have revealed. The rate of loss has doubled since the turn of the century, indicating a “devastating” future for the region, upon which a billion people depend for regular water. The analysis shows 8bn tonnes of ice are being lost every year and not replaced by snow, with lower level glaciers shrinking in height by five metres annually. The study shows that only global heating caused by human activities can explain the heavy melting. It combined declassified US spy satellite images from the mid-1970s with modern satellite data to create the first detailed, four-decade record of ice along the 1,200-mile mountain chain.Porn block on shelf – The UK’s online pornography age checking regime is expected to be delayed indefinitely. It had been due to come into force on 15 July, but it is understood government officials failed to notify the European commission of key details. Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, is expected to give a statement on the issue in the House of Commons this morning. The block, which would require users to provide proof they are over 18, was due to be one of the first of its kind anywhere in the democratic world. But it has come under repeated attack from privacy campaigners who have raised fears it would be possible to connect an inidual’s browsing habits to their identity, which could then be exposed in a data leak.Bus stop attack – Four members of a girl gang who inflicted a “sustained and horrific” bus stop attack on a frightened Egyptian student who later died have been given non-custodial sentences. Mariam Moustafa, 18, had a stroke and went into a coma after being slammed against a bus shelter on 20 February 2018. She died the following month.After admitting affray, Rochelle Dobbin and Netesha Lewis, both 18, and two 16-year-old girls were handed referral orders by a district judge at Nottingham youth court on Wednesday. The district judge condemned the teenagers as “aggressive” but said the court would only jail young people as a last resort. Six people in all were charged, and two women had already been sentenced: Mariah Fraser, 20, was ordered to spend eight months in a young offender institution, while Britania Hunter was given a 12-month community order and 40 hours’ unpaid work.The Women’s World Cup favourites, the US, are taking on their governing body in a gender equality lawsuit that could have huge implications for women’s sport.

Desperate for work, these labourers will accept any job in the fields even if the wages are far below, and the hours far above, union standards.Italy’s agricultural sector is booming, with the tomato industry alone worth £2.8bn. Mass immigration is chaotic and uncontrolled, the exploitation of immigrant workers is systematic – and the produce they pick regularly ends up on the shelves of Italian and international supermarkets, bought by consumers who have no idea of the suffering involved.

But while England can look forward Scotland can look only back with regret after they were knocked out in dramatic circumstances in their final Group D game. There are some 20 Cricket World Cup group games still to run but after New Zealand’s Kane Williamson produced an epic unbeaten 106 to overcome South Africa in a tense finale at Edgbaston, the identity of the four semi-finalists is already taking shape. Eoin Morgan claimed his six-hitting spree against Afghanistan went beyond his wildest dreams but, for Joe Root, who watched all but one of the 17 record-breaking blows from the non-striker’s end, the captain’s assault came as no surprise.Global rugby union is braced for fresh turmoil after the governing body announced it had discontinued plans to introduce a Nations Championship for the leading Test nations. And Feliciano López sought to restore some injured pride on Wednesday when he denied any suggestion that he and his regular doubles partner, Marc López, had been involved in an alleged betting scam at Wimbledon in 2017.The battle for the Tory leadership and Tuesday’s BBC debate dominate the front pages today, and the adjectives are out in force. “Biased Brazen Contemptible” screams the Mail, complaining that leadership hopefuls were subjected to a “disgraceful debate” involving “nakedly anti-Tory” guests. The Express sings a similar tune with “Storm over Tory TV debate”.The fight to be the next leader of the Conservative party, and the country, features heavily in other papers. The Times predicts “Javid ‘wants to be the next chancellor’”, while the i leads with “Gove momentum builds but Tories fear dirty tricks.” The  is also worried about the chances of the environment minister: “Johnson hatches plot to knock out Gove”.The  splashes on the ramifications of the end of an insurgent campaign: “Stewart exists Tory leadership race as Johnson pushes further ahead”.

As I reached new heights, so too did my imagination. I revelled in finding a space where I could be alone, high above the world, to plot and dream and wonder.Carefully aligning my own limbs along those of the tree, I would quickly but methodically scale it, seeking out footholds, adjusting my balance as I tested each branch for whether it would bear my weight. Every tree was different, its arms spread in unique directions, inviting me to learn the climbing patterns and to inspect the knots and holes in the bark until I knew it like my own body.I wasn’t always good at climbing trees. Indeed, I remember the first time I tried I could barely make it off the ground. Our back garden in north London backed on to a small wood, with a winding brook lined by hundreds of trees. They were massive and ancient and imposing, and I was barely a sprout. The big boys could climb so much higher and faster, and this pushed me to improve, to overcome my fears and rise to the challenge. I didn’t learn so much from watching where they placed their hands and feet, but more from their spirit of fearlessness – a spirit that has remained with me to this day.And the rewards for meeting this challenge were numerous. That feeling of shinning up the tree, of upward motion. The view from the top, revealing a wider horizon. The sweet sound of birdsong, of the wind rustling through the leaves. The feeling of accomplishment, of overcoming a challenge different with every tree I climbed. Being nursed by my mother on the occasions I fell.But the ultimate payoff was making my own space. Up in the highest branches, where no one could bother me, my young mind could run wild. I dreamed of the adventures my life would bring, and invented new games to play with my friends. I contemplated the rights and wrongs of school life, the little society in which I sometimes struggled to find my place. I pictured our early ancestors, still imbued with a simian strain that allowed them to stalk soundlessly through the canopy, and what they would think of us today, in our warm houses orced from our animal instincts.To me, trees were a symbol of strength – nature at its most grand and enduring. Once my friends and I found a dead squirrel, hanging by its throat in the branches high above. It served as a powerful reminder of how deadly nature could be. We would visit daily to mourn the poor creature and to contemplate our own mortality, humbled by the majesty of the woods around us.I still climb trees. I may be older – married, with a child of my own – but the thrill remains the same. Even better, I can climb together with my daughter, who is as wobbly as I was as a boy, and help her to find the confidence to improve her balance and dexterity to get further up the tree each time. It’s a wonderfully wholesome pastime for kids, providing not only exercise but also the chance to get up close with nature and gulp some fresh air. If you have a garden, a local park or a nearby forest, go out and explore – an arboreal adventure awaits.I never did learn the names of the different trees in the woods behind my childhood home, but I never forgot how to scale them, nor the new frontiers my childhood imagination was able to forge – all alone in the treetops, safe and happy in the embrace of nature’s ancient giants."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Colleges claimed new measures would hinder efforts to deal with sexual assault casesFormer OPW staffer alleges major value-for-money failures in State bodyDisorderly Brexit or other negative external shock could prevent overheatingVaradkar to be in discussions on EU\u0026rsquos strategic agenda for the next five yearsThe many aims for inidual sectors remain highly aspirational with little detailSiptu warns of further possible strikes by healthcare assistants, lab aides and portersVaradkar tells D\u0026aacuteil \u0026lsquoI have the measure of Trump\u0026rsquo after their meeting in ShannonMinister for Finance says it is too early to say if IFAC\u0026rsquos recent concerns are legitimateSome 22 schools built by Western Building Systems were found to have structural flawsPolice chief to lead fresh inquiry into disputed shooting of 24-year-old victimIssue arose from the consolidation of different parts of college, PAC hearsPeople Before Profit TD says the Government is continuing to issue exploration licences, build runways and construct a gas terminalCommittee hears current plan should be terminated and \u0026lsquomore affordable alternatives explored\u0026rsquoComplainant wishes to waive her anonymity but can\u0026rsquot do so pending High Court decision, court toldWicklow school to allow boys wear skirts or girls to wear trousersMinister halts legislation after meeting advocacy groups, lawyers, social workersYouth council calls for increased funding for sector which serves 380,000 teenagers"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3931155.1560970074!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac to hear of serious shortcomings in opw property management","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOPW’s property deals have been under the spotlight since ‘overpayment’ of €21m for   Department of Health move to Miesian Plaza. Photograph: Bryan James Brophy A former employee in the Office of Public Works will on Thursday tell a private session of the Public Accounts Committee that they highlighted alleged “serious shortcomings and failures” in the property management unit of the organisation.The organisation’s approach to property deals has been under the spotlight in recent months after it emerged that the move by the Department of Health to new headquarters at Miesian Plaza, the former Bank of Ireland building on Baggot Street, led to an “overpayment” of €21 million, according to a previous report by the PAC.The former worker, who authored a 2017 report on value for money in the OPW’s property acquisitions, will tell the committee that a previous hearing held into the Miesian overspending “encapsulated in a single session and in a single case many examples of process failure similar to previous examples which I witnessed numerous times during my career in OPW property”.The witness statement argues that the OPW operates in a “budget driven” culture which leaves it under-equipped to operate effectively when purchasing properties from the private sector. “The essential difference between the private and public sectors is that the private property sector seeks to maximise returns from property whereas the State views property as a necessary burden required for housing civil servants, gardaí, etc.”‘Cultural problem’Complaining of a “cultural problem”, the former OPW employee argues that a commercial State entity should be created to manage the State’s property portfolio, similar to how Coillte manages the State’s forestry assets. Such an organisation “is needed to safeguard the State’s interests”.“As a serious and active property player the State, in military parlance, needs an army to face down threats given that opponents (ie the private sector in this instance) will not acknowledge a peace corps.”Asked about the allegations contained in the opening statement, the OPW said that it “at all times seeks to ensure value for money outcomes in the development of property solutions to address the requirements for the delivery of public services”.The OPW said it has acted on the recommendations of a 2017 report examining five completed property transactions for vulnerabilities, a report which it said has also been considered by the PAC. “The OPW constructively engaged with the staff members in question and continue to engage with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, with a view to addressing the concerns raised.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3931306.1560977264!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tusk has been busy sounding out preferences for top eu jobs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Donald Tusk: “I remain cautiously optimistic as those I have spoken to have expressed determination to decide swiftly.”  Photograph: ReutersKacper PempelAngela Merkel will on Thursday meet Emmanuel Macron in Brussels on their way to the latest European summit. On their agenda is the vexed matter of who should be appointed next European Commission president.Elsewhere in the city a group of six prime ministers, the “co-ordinations” elected by EU leaders from the three main European Parliament parties, will also meet again to broker an agreement on how to share out the EU top jobs.The task has been allocated to Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic and Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins, representing the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and his Belgian counterpart Charles Michel, representing the camp formerly known as the\u0026nbspLiberals – now rechristened Renew Europe, to embrace Macronistas and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez and Portugal’s António Costa, representing the Social Democrats.In the European Parliament a separate group of MEPs from the same parties (plus the Greens) will publish a joint programme of activities for the next parliamentary term – evidence, they will argue, that although no party has a majority, there is a broad pro-Europe majority in the parliament and that they should be allowed to put their man, Manfred Weber, into the top job.Weber’s party, the EPP, will be having its own summit later in the morning, as will the Socialists and Democrats, the parliament’s second group.European Council president Donald Tusk has been on the phone repeatedly to every capital sounding out\u0026nbsppreferences not only for the European Commission job but for his own job, the presidency of the European Central Bank, and the high representative for foreign and security policy.\u0026nbspOnly after all of that does the summit begin. OptimisticEach of these separate parallel strands expects to contribute to the final decisions which, Tusk hopes, will be made on Thursday night at the summit over dinner.“I remain cautiously optimistic as those I have spoken to have expressed determination to decide swiftly. I hope we can make it on Thursday,” he told leaders on Wednesday in his letter of invitation to the meeting. \u0026nbspSources close to him were on Wednesday stressing Tusk’s determination to achieve an outcome, and saying the issue could be taken up again on Friday. Others have warned of the likely need for another summit before the European Parliament convenes on July 1st.My own prediction, for what it is worth, is that whenever it happens Michel Barnier, the chief Brexit negotiator and an EPP nominee, will get the commission job Socialist Dutch commission VP Frans Timmermans will become high representative Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann will get the ECB post and Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite will get Tusk’s job. \u0026nbspTwo of the main parties placated, Germany satisfied, one woman for gender balance, and a position for an eastern European state. DiplomatsSeparately, diplomats in Brussels have been poring over the final declaration of the summit. As usual there is broad agreement, although a couple of issues could provoke potentially major rows. A small minority of states are blocking a decision to commit the EU to carbon neutrality by 2050. EU officials are confident, however, that the required unanimity will be achieved by December.There is disappointment at the failure to back the opening of negotiations on accession with North Macedonia and Albania, who have both fulfilled the criteria set out by the commission. There are concerns that refusing to even open talks will send destabilising signals about the EU’s long-term willingness to bring them in, and fail to reward North Macedonia in particular for its difficult compromise with Greece over its name. The leaders will agree to try again in October.The debate on the euro zone also promises to be lively, with some fiscally conservative states determined to thwart attempts to create funding outside the EU budget for a new euro zone budget.Brexit will be touched on briefly on Friday after the economic debate. Tusk and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker will report on progress and, in the only response to the Tory leadership race, Tusk is expected to repeat the standard mantra that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.

The Technical Alternative Arrangements Advisory Group, which will meet for the first time on Thursday is the first of three advisory groups to be appointed next year and will be followed by a business and trade union panel and a panel of parliamentarians. The advisory group will be chaired by Brexit secretary Steve Barclay and financial secretary to the treasury Jesse Norman.“There has been considerable debate about the alternative arrangements that could be put in place to replace the backstop, including how we could harness the power of cutting-edge technologies, trusted trader schemes, and IT systems,” Mr Barclay said.“There has also been shared recognition by both the UK Government and the EU Commission that this work must be an absolute priority as we shape the future partnership. The technical group will provide a forum for experts to discuss workable alternative arrangements, assessing both capability and timelines and bringing their significant experience to bear.”Dublin and Brussels have endorsed the search for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop but they insist that the technology does not yet exist and that the backstop must be introduced as part of the withdrawal agreement. The advisory group includes Michael Bell, executive director of Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Tim Mairs PSNI assistant chief constable Katy Hayward, reader in social isions and conflict at Queen’s University Belfast and Dutch customs expert Hans Maessen.“This group represents a broad spectrum of views and expertise, all of which will be needed to achieve our economic, fiscal and security objectives in the unique circumstances of the Northern Ireland land border,” Mr Barclay said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeFormer Interpol chief pleads guilty in Chinese bribery case amid crackdown by authoritiesTory leadership latest: Knives are out as MPs from rival camps attack each other over tactical voting ahead of final roundsComment: In our age of impunity, we need to be honest about how Brexit Britain should behaveThe Government\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites faces delay, just a month before its official launchThe rise and fall of Rory Stewart: Was it tactical voting or an \u0026#39awful\u0026#39 debate that derailed Tory leadership bid?You\u0026#39re gonna need a bigger boat: Fishermen get up close and personal with huge great white shark Comment: Boris Johnson would \u0026#39relish\u0026#39 challenge of winning back voters and defeating Jeremy CorbynComment: Our ex-forces volunteers go the extra mile to save lives.  So why won\u0026#39t Dfid back Britain\u0026#39s plucky aid underdogs?China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping arrives in North Korea on historic visitEngland ranked worst in world for cyberbullying of students, education report findsClean Air Day: find how polluted your area is and where to go for a breath of fresh airPensioners now spend an extra £100-a-week on drinking and eating out, report findsMigratory birds may be spreading superbugs, researchers warn Iran shoots down US drone amid rising tensions in Strait of Hormuz Joe Biden refuses to apologise amid Democrat anger at remarks on segregationist senatorsAllocating £14bn UK aid budget across government means the world\u0026#39s poor miss outBritish Army needs \u0026#39fundamentally different mindset\u0026#39 as it reforms to fight major battles again, report saysNHS plans for faster treatment of stroke \u0026#39will save thousands of lives\u0026#39   Fitness tests for female fire fighters could be reviewed because of lack of women, say HM inspectorsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

dog eyes evolutionary trick manipulate humans say scientists","story":"Dogs have evolved to manipulate humans with their eyes, scientists claimThe next time a dog looks up at you with those big, soppy eyes and your heart begins to melt, be aware: you are being manipulated by 33,000 years of evolution.That is the conclusion of a new scientific study which argues that the raised eyebrows so beloved of owners are more of a survival strategy than an expression of friendship.The clues, its authors argue, lie in a comparison with wolves, which dogs began evolving from after they were first domesticated by Stone Age man.Anatomical analysis reveals that while modern dogs have developed small muscles around the eyes which allows them to raise their inner eyebrows, wolves possess hardly any comparable muscles.Such a stark ersion in what in evolutionary terms is a short period of time has led the researchers to believe that humans naturally favour canines able to look at them with big “puppy dog” eyes, giving them a selection advantage.Their findings complement previous studies which suggest that big eyes trigger a caregiving response in humans because it reminds them of babies.Scientists already know that dogs’ ability to read human behaviour and emotion is almost unique within the animal kingdom, and there is growing evidence that eye contact is crucial to this.Dr Juliane Kaminski, who led the research at the University of Portsmouth, said: “The findings suggest that expressive eyebrows in dogs may be a result of humans\u0027 unconscious preferences that influenced selection during domestication.“When dogs make the movement, it seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.“This would give dogs, that move their eyebrows more, a selection advantage over others and reinforce the ‘puppy dog eyes’ trait for future generations.”Scientists already know that dogs’ ability to read human behaviour and emotion is almost unique The researchers dissected the facial anatomy of four wild grey wolves and six domestic dogs, focusing on a region of muscle they called Action Unit 101.They found stark differences in muscle fibre concentration between the species.The team also compared the behaviour of live wolves and dogs when exposed to humans for two minutes, finding that the dogs raised their inner eyebrows more and at a higher intensity than wolves.“This is a striking difference for species separated only 33,000 years ago and we think that the remarkably fast facial muscular changes can be directly linked to dogs’ enhanced social interaction with humans,” said co-author Professor Anne Burrows, who led the anatomical research at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh.A study in 2015 showed that a shared gaze between humans and dogs results in a hormonal response in both parties similar to that between a mother and baby.Two years earlier, scientists proved rescue dogs were more likely to find an owner if they raised their inner eyebrows.Surveys have also shown that humans tend to favour dogs with infant-like characteristics such as a large forehead, as well as eyes.“The AU101 movement is significant in the human-dog bond because it might elicit acaring response from humans but also might create the illusion of human-like communication,” said Dr Kaminski.The new research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

China wants a breakthrough.Mr Kim has already visited Xi in China four times since last year, and China has praised North Korea and the United States for trying to resolve their issues through dialogue rather than threats of force or military posturing.While China has signed up to United Nations sanctions for the North\u0027s repeated nuclear and missile tests, saying it is enforcing them fully, despite some US doubts, it has suggested sanctions relief for the country.Inside North Korea: Everyday life in the secretive state, in picturesChina, engaged in a bitter trade war with the United States, has also defended its normal trade and business ties with North Korea.This week, in a rare honour afforded a foreign leader, Mr Xi wrote in the Rodong Sinmun that China supported North Korea\u0027s correct direction in politically resolving issues on the Korean peninsula.China has also suggested the tough sanctions on the North could be eased if it abides by UN resolutions.With fuel imports limited and most major exports banned, the international sanctions appear to be hurting the North\u0027s economy.State media say drought has hit North Korea, with international aid groups reporting food production has dropped dramatically amid poor harvests.Mr Xi\u0027s entourage includes China\u0027s two top diplomats and He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, Chinese state media said in a brief report.China may step up people-to-people exchanges to provide economic help without overtly breaking sanctions and as a way to extend humanitarian aid without offending North Korean pride, said Leif-Eric Easley, who studies northeast Asian security ties at Ewha Womans University in the South Korean capital of Seoul.More experts may travel from China to support North Korea\u0027s technical capacity building, and more Chinese tourist arrivals will help North Korea deal with its shortfall in foreign currency under sanctions.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This small, dynamic NGO, deploys teams of ex-military, first responders and committed civilians into the heart of natural disasters.Most recently in Mozambique, Team Rubicon’s unique approach and expertise alleviated the desperate circumstances of over 177, 000 people in dire need.  We tackle the challenges that larger charities cannot.But I am frustrated.More than £18 million was raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee from the ever generous British public for humanitarian efforts in Mozambique but Team Rubicon did not see a penny of it.Nor can we access Government funding. DfID spent 75 per cent of the £14.5 billion Official Development Assistance budget last year but Team Rubicon got nothing.Ever get the feeling that the bank will only lend you money when you have it, not when you need it? During the response phase, Team Rubicon delivered 60 per cent of the remote aid outside of Beira in Mozambique but DfID focused solely on the largest NGOs, granting hundreds of millions – they don’t want to support us because we don’t fit their conventional model.Eye of the storm | Hunger stalks a shattered nationTheir strict criteria and stringent processes are, I grant,  reassuring for taxpayers but their approach to funding the very small (less than £250K income) or the very big (at least £10M in reserves) leaves Team Rubicon and our former military and emergency services personnel out in the cold. We\u0027re a young charity but the concept is proven. The larger NGOs do amazing work operate on a staggering scale and are not the target of my frustration – but they need smaller-scale delivery partners if victims are to be properly served in the challenging circumstances that are created by natural disasters. Our people thrive in ‘challenging’, they are built for it and have proved themselves capable and responsive in those environments many times already. Team Rubicon bridges a gap between immediate search and rescue operations and longer term recovery.  Our people load up their backpacks and walk in. They navigate devastated terrain to reach remote communities who would otherwise wait weeks or months for assistance after a natural disaster. Many communities are abandoned to their fate – because they are too hard to reach.In Mozambique our teams of four not only found these forgotten communities they sourced the aid and delivered it by helicopter, truck, motorbike or foot. Many had been without clean drinking water for weeks so our teams carried in portable water purification systems which they then instructed the local people how to use so they could move on to the next task. In emergencies like these, interventions of this nature can be life-saving.Sebastian Rhodes Stamper of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Mozambique, said: “Team Rubicon UK is a critical component of the broader response throughout the affected area. They bring with them determination, drive, professionalism and a highly commendable ‘can-do’ attitude. In short, Team Rubicon UK is a real asset here and is making an extraordinary difference.”Why does this matter? In the last 30 years, more than 2.5 million people have died and over 3 trillion pounds has been lost because of natural disasters. The World Bank reports that almost 75 per cent of the losses are attributable to extreme weather events.We need to get our response right, but Team Rubicon doesn’t just respond when things go wrong –  it’s trying to stop the rot and its disaster risk reduction programmes can help reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact both physically and financially.Cyclone Idai | Clinging to lifePost response and recovery, Team Rubicon\u0027s programmes address the continued human suffering that remains, often for prolonged periods of time. In 2018 there were communities in Lapabesi, Nepal which still had no power three years after the earthquake, relying on kerosene lamps – the equivalent of smoking 20 cigarettes a day. We provided solar power because our teams put the equipment on their backs and carried it through the mountains.We have trained communities in the Caribbean hot to protect their way of life and return to normality more quickly.  In Indonesia and Nepal, we have been able to assist where other International Aid agencies could not. And we are looking at proactive, life changing projects in the DR Congo, Sierra Leone and the BVI.Why should you care? Because we do not, and must not, abandon people who are suffering unimaginable hardship and loss from climate change and natural disasters, simply because of the vagaries of birth and geography. Throughout my life I have worked with those who walk towards danger or suffering to help fellow human beings and it humbles me that Team Rubicon is willing to do it still. And they are volunteers!It cost us £1.01 to help each of the 178,000 people in Mozambique. We cut costs on delivery wherever we could – our teams’ mantras being ‘we are spending your mother’s money’Team Rubicon UK is the plucky underdog swimming with the big dogs and punching way above its weight. It represents the best of Great Britain’s compassion and moral conscience yet despite our best efforts the Government has no desire to support us.There is extraordinary growth potential. With £5 million we could respond to nine UN emergency response deployments plus 10 other international disaster relief operations. It could provide another 2250 Team Rubicon volunteers and cover all training, deployment and operational costs. It would mean we could reach 3.2 million people in need.Five million out of our £14.5 billion UK aid budget doesn’t sound very much when you look at it like that, does it?General Sir Nick Parker is Chairman of Team Rubicon UK  and a former Commander in Chief of UK Land ForcesProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Department for International DevelopmentFormer Interpol chief pleads guilty in Chinese bribery case amid crackdown by authoritiesTory leadership latest: Knives are out as MPs from rival camps attack each other over tactical voting ahead of final roundsComment: In our age of impunity, we need to be honest about how Brexit Britain should behaveThe Government\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites faces delay, just a month before its official launchThe rise and fall of Rory Stewart: Was it tactical voting or an \u0026#39awful\u0026#39 debate that derailed Tory leadership bid?You\u0026#39re gonna need a bigger boat: Fishermen get up close and personal with huge great white shark Comment: Boris Johnson would \u0026#39relish\u0026#39 challenge of winning back voters and defeating Jeremy CorbynChina\u0026#39s Xi Jinping arrives in North Korea on historic visitMigratory birds may be spreading superbugs, researchers warn Pensioners now spend an extra £100-a-week on drinking and eating out, report findsEngland ranked worst in world for cyberbullying of students, education report findsClean Air Day: find how polluted your area is and where to go for a breath of fresh airIran shoots down US drone amid rising tensions in Strait of Hormuz Joe Biden refuses to apologise amid Democrat anger at remarks on segregationist senatorsAllocating £14bn UK aid budget across government means the world\u0026#39s poor miss outBritish Army needs \u0026#39fundamentally different mindset\u0026#39 as it reforms to fight major battles again, report saysNHS plans for faster treatment of stroke \u0026#39will save thousands of lives\u0026#39   Fitness tests for female fire fighters could be reviewed because of lack of women, say HM inspectorsPhilip Hammond to warn that no-deal Brexit will drain over £26bn of the UK\u0026#39s economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/19/TELEMMGLPICT000201277961_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pensioners now spend extra 100 a week drinking eating report","story":"People aged 65-and-over living in the UK are increasingly likely to spend more socialising during their retirementSocial and Religious Affairs EditorPartying pensioners have been unmasked as a generation of big spenders in a report which reveals that they spend more than £100-a-week on alcohol and eating out than their predecessors.People aged 65-and-over living in the UK are increasingly likely to enjoy their retirement.This is not only in contrast to their previous generation, but also millenials who are devoting a smaller amount of their spending on “fun stuff” such as recreational activities, clothing and footwear, restaurants, hotels, culture, alcohol and tobacco.In a report published today by the Resolution Foundation entitled, An Intergenerational Audit for the UK: 2019, researchers found that between 2001 and 2002, the average Briton aged 65 and over spent £283 on such “fun stuff”.However, this figure rose by £105 in 2017-18 to £388.While experts acknowledge that the rate of inflation has impacted the increase in figures, they added that many pensioners are reaping the benefits of “enjoying later life” and that spending on non-essentials has not only “grown strongly” but is also “increasingly less about covering the essentials”.In contrast, millennials, or those aged 18-29, spent £406 a week in 2001-2001. However by 2017-2018, this figure had fallen by £28 to £387.Researchers found that weekly spending on non-essentials has increased with each generation in the past 20 years, contributing to the notion of partying pensioners enjoying their retirement and increasing their spending.Furthermore for people aged 30-49, researchers found that their weekly spending rose by £3 to £418 in the same period and those aged 50-64 saw their weekly spending rise by £44 to £460.The report noted: “Overall, these changes in what people spend their money on support the conclusion that the 21st century has been characterised by a squeeze on spending – especially spending that is discretionary, or just plain ‘fun’ – for millennial and generation X cohorts.”Researchers also identified a number of intergenerational living standards challenges facing Britain, including the fall in money spent by 18 to 29-year-olds on non-housing items, including recreation and eating out, returning their pay to pre-financial crisis levels, and a long road to recovery on home ownership.The report was launched in conjunction with the think tank’s new Intergenerational Centre, which will be dedicated to analyse policy on generational living standards.David Willetts, President of the Intergenerational Centre, said: “From frustrations about buying a first home to fears about the cost of care, Britain faces many intergenerational challenges. The big living standards gains that each generation used to enjoy over their predecessors have stalled.“But while Britain’s intergenerational challenges are big, they are not insurmountable. Welcome steps are already being made – from stronger pay growth for young millennials to the success of auto-enrolment into pension saving.“By looking for solutions through a generational lens we can repair the social contract between generations, and help bring our country back together again.”Claire Turner, Director of Evidence at Centre for Ageing Better, said: “It’s great that many people are enjoying later life and can do the things they want to do. One of the keys to a good later life is having lots of good social connections.”However she added: “But we mustn’t ignore the growing number of people missing out. Older people who don’t go out much often say it’s because of a lack of money, being in poor health, or needing to care for a loved one.“Relationships are what matter most to us all. We need to create communities that make it easier to stay active and be connected.”Former Interpol chief pleads guilty in Chinese bribery case amid crackdown by authoritiesTory leadership latest: Knives are out as MPs from rival camps attack each other over tactical voting ahead of final roundsComment: In our age of impunity, we need to be honest about how Brexit Britain should behaveThe Government\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites faces delay, just a month before its official launchThe rise and fall of Rory Stewart: Was it tactical voting or an \u0026#39awful\u0026#39 debate that derailed Tory leadership bid?You\u0026#39re gonna need a bigger boat: Fishermen get up close and personal with huge great white shark Comment: Boris Johnson would \u0026#39relish\u0026#39 challenge of winning back voters and defeating Jeremy CorbynComment: Our ex-forces volunteers go the extra mile to save lives.  So why won\u0026#39t Dfid back Britain\u0026#39s plucky aid underdogs?China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping arrives in North Korea on historic visitEngland ranked worst in world for cyberbullying of students, education report findsClean Air Day: find how polluted your area is and where to go for a breath of fresh airMigratory birds may be spreading superbugs, researchers warn Iran shoots down US drone amid rising tensions in Strait of Hormuz Joe Biden refuses to apologise amid Democrat anger at remarks on segregationist senatorsAllocating £14bn UK aid budget across government means the world\u0026#39s poor miss outBritish Army needs \u0026#39fundamentally different mindset\u0026#39 as it reforms to fight major battles again, report saysNHS plans for faster treatment of stroke \u0026#39will save thousands of lives\u0026#39   Fitness tests for female fire fighters could be reviewed because of lack of women, say HM inspectorsPhilip Hammond to warn that no-deal Brexit will drain over £26bn of the UK\u0026#39s economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 20 june 2019","story":"A visitor looks at \u0027Untitled\u0027 by Keith Haring, part of the American Icons exhibition at the Opera Gallery, New Bond Street, London.Geoff Pugh for The  Former Interpol chief pleads guilty in Chinese bribery case amid crackdown by authoritiesTory leadership latest: Knives are out as MPs from rival camps attack each other over tactical voting ahead of final roundsComment: In our age of impunity, we need to be honest about how Brexit Britain should behaveThe Government\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites faces delay, just a month before its official launchThe rise and fall of Rory Stewart: Was it tactical voting or an \u0026#39awful\u0026#39 debate that derailed Tory leadership bid?You\u0026#39re gonna need a bigger boat: Fishermen get up close and personal with huge great white shark Comment: Boris Johnson would \u0026#39relish\u0026#39 challenge of winning back voters and defeating Jeremy CorbynComment: Our ex-forces volunteers go the extra mile to save lives.  So why won\u0026#39t Dfid back Britain\u0026#39s plucky aid underdogs?China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping arrives in North Korea on historic visitEngland ranked worst in world for cyberbullying of students, education report findsClean Air Day: find how polluted your area is and where to go for a breath of fresh airPensioners now spend an extra £100-a-week on drinking and eating out, report findsMigratory birds may be spreading superbugs, researchers warn Iran shoots down US drone amid rising tensions in Strait of Hormuz Joe Biden refuses to apologise amid Democrat anger at remarks on segregationist senatorsAllocating £14bn UK aid budget across government means the world\u0026#39s poor miss outBritish Army needs \u0026#39fundamentally different mindset\u0026#39 as it reforms to fight major battles again, report saysNHS plans for faster treatment of stroke \u0026#39will save thousands of lives\u0026#39   Fitness tests for female fire fighters could be reviewed because of lack of women, say HM inspectorsPhilip Hammond to warn that no-deal Brexit will drain over £26bn of the UK\u0026#39s economyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs awash with cash its dishonest to pretend they cant help out the over 75s","story":"What rubbish.

Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so.

Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same.

We’re very early in the research phase.It is only used when other treatments, such as long-term antibiotics, have failed.How is it performed The treatment should only ever be performed by a qualied doctor.It involves collecting a stool sample from a donor, who is tested to ensure they carry no harmful bugs and have the correct bacteria in their digestive tracts to help combat the bug.The sample is then mixed with saline, strained and placed into the patient via a colonoscopy, endoscopy or an enema.How does it work FMT aims to replace good bacteria that has been killed or suppressed, often by the use of antibiotics.This killing of good bacteria allows bad bacteria, specically C.df, to over-populate the colon.The infection can then lead to a condition called C.df colitis, which causes painful and sometimes fatal diarrhoea.By restoring the balance of bacteria in the intestines, the idea is that the patient will be better able to fight infection.Who can be a donor Donors can be family members, or others who are known to you.But, they must:Donors are screened for a range of infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis A, B and C and syphilis.Source: Guy’s and St Thomas’ HospitalIn April, a University of Arizona study created shockwaves after researchers demonstrated long-term benefits of faecal transplants in reducing autism symptoms in children.A growing number of scientists believe gut microbiomes affect how the brain communicates with the body as well as general neurological health.The study, published in the journal Scientic Reports, found a special type of faecal transplant improved gut health and eased autism symptoms.The study said: “At two years post-treatment, most of the initial improvements in gut symptoms remained. In addition, parents reported a slow steady reduction of ASD symptoms during treatment and over the next two years.“A professional evaluator found a  per cent reduction in core ASD symptomsat two years post-treatment compared to before treatment began.”While the results are promising on the surface, Dr Paramsothy says it’s “early days” when it comes to scientically demonstrating the broader benefits of FMT.He said: “Developments like these are always promising, but what you really want to be seeing is randomised control trial data.“It’s important that we get confirmatory studies that demonstrate true benefit before we start advocating it as a main line treatment.

the pop duo contains the lyrics: You think youre mad too unstable [...] Call the police theres a mad man around, Running down underground.Crossley told cops afterwards hed had no sleep after taking £ worth of crack the previous day.Sir Robert, who attended the sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey, was saved by teacher Riyah El Hussani who leapt from the  just one minute before a train was due to arrive.Five psychiatric reports by three doctors were filed on paranoid schizophrenic Crossley after he was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder by a jury.The second count was for trying to push a second man, Tobias French, on to the tracks at Tottenham Court Road as a train approached.Crossley boarded the train before then attacking Sir Robert at nearby Marble Arch station.The court heard how Crossley had pushed Sir Robert deliberately because he looked odd and looked unlikely to be able to withstand the attack.Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: As far as Sir Robert Malpas is concerned, apart from lacerations to his skull, he had multiple fractures to his right pelvis, and spent a week in hospital.The recovery was long and he described the effect on his le as huge, emotionally and physically.Referring to Dr Hannah John-Kamens three reports on Crossley, he said: An amount of stress has been placed on this defendant hearing a song, West End Girls, and getting on the Tube.The defendant said in evidence that before pushing... something in his head say, yes, yes, yes, I am going to harm someone one.We know that the defendant had in fact been threatened by drug dealers to whom he owed a large sum of money.It may be fair to say that in the first report a number of possible factors are mentioned, come the end shes probably putting psychosis up to the top of the list in terms of signicance where as Dr Joseph takes a dferent view.The court heard Crossley was given a -month suspended jail sentence last January for sexually assaulting a care worker in June  and racially abusing another female care worker for saying he should go to his probation service appointments.Crossley, of Leyton, East London, also received a two months suspended jail sentence for having a kne in a public place in September .Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, said: He pushed Tobias French towards the train tracks as a Central Line train was approaching.The train was about  metres away.Mr French was fortunate in that he was able to resist.Mr Crossley then caught a train to Marble Arch station where he pushed Sir Robert Malpas on to the train tracks.The court heard Sir Robert was  years old at the time and suffered severe cuts to his head, needing  stitches, as well as a fractured pelvis.Mr Aina said: While Sir Robert was in the pit below the tracks he was bravely assisted by a member of the public, Riyah El Hussani, who jumped down to the tracks.Mr El Hussani received a burn as he touched an electried track, but again, fortunately, he has recovered from his physical injury.When asked for an explanation for his action by police in his formal interview held the next day, Mr Crossley simply said, I had no sleep.During the trial, he stated in evidence, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was  year old.The defendant claimed he had not taken medication for his condition that day and had taken about £ worth of crack cocaine the day before.Continuing to describe his claims, Mr Aina said: It was a day out in West End when he was on the train  he began to hear voices and was paranoid, he said he pushed Mr French to scare him.When he got to Marble Arch he was having a panic attack.He said he was only intending to push Sir Robert Malpas to the floor.Giving evidence Dr Anneka John-Kamen said psyhcosis was a key actor in his actions when asked by Mr AIna.She said he had attributed signicant meaning to hearing the West End Girls song in the West End.He does have a history of hearing things on the radio or television which he gives signicant meaning to.She said these delusions of reference were an element of psychosis.The sentencing hearing continues."},{"url":null,"title":"world is more peaceful now than

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is however unclear whether government is achieving its objectives in the  UK Aid Strategy.“Government does not know whether giving responsibility for spending ODA to a larger number of departments has had the impact it intended. And its progress in improving the transparency of spending has been slow.“While there is good evidence that many aid programmes are securing an impact inidually, government does not know whether all parts of ODA, taken together, are securing value for money.”The reports piled pressure on Aid Secretary and Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart.Responding to the reports he said last night: “The NAO report raises questions about how aid is spent across government.“So I will be working closely with my colleagues in other aid-spending departments to support them and ensure they benefit from DfID’s expertise.

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain. And on Friday she told all the other girls Tommy was giving her “fanny flutters”, who I think I once backed to win the  Guineas.Tommy’s now wearing the same haunted expression as a male praying mantis just before his head’s removed during the mating process, but by far the best thing about Maura’s arrival in the villa has been her verdict on herself. “I’m a girl’s girl.” RemarkableThe naive but still widespread belief Madonna will one day give a good interview.

Lord George Foulkes will table a Private Member’s Bill on Thursday aimed at repealing the provision which switched the burden onto the BBC. The  stitch-up ultimately led to last week’s decision by the Corporation to means-test the leline so only over-s on Pension Credit will be eligible. It came despite the Conservatives promising at the  election to preserve the benefit for the duration of this Parliament, due to run until . An estimated . million OAPS face being stripped of free licences, worth £. a year, under the plan.    Only around . million households will be eligible under the new scheme. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, Lord Foulkes said: “TV is vital for older people living alone and . million, including many struggling to survive on the basic pension, now face the loss the of their free TV licence. “This is a social welfare issue and one that the Conservatives promised in their manesto to protect for the letime of this Parliament. “That responsibility cannot be passed from the Government to the BBC. “My Bill will transfer the responsibility back to the Government, thereby enabling them to keep their election promise to maintain these free TV licences.” Currently all households with someone aged  or over are entitled to a free licence. But the universal benefit was doomed when the Tories and BBC agreed a deal in  for the corporation to take on the burden of funding the licences. Yet just two years later, the Conservatives pledged in their election manesto to protect the benefit until .    BBC Director-General Lord Tony Hall blamed Tory austerity for the move, which would have lumped the Corporation with a £million annual bill to maintain the concession. “I remember the conversation with the then Secretary of State very, very clearly…- this was going to happen come what may,” he told peers this week. “We took on this policy and it was made quite clear ... the policy would come to us and we would have to consult on it, and that is exactly what we have done.” Lord Foulkes, an MP for  years, a former Scotland Minister and a former director of Age Concern Scotland, hopes the plan will receive wide support across Parliament and force a U-turn by the Tories. The Mirror is campaigning to save the leline, with more than , readers backing the battle by completing coupons in the paper.Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson and former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown have supported the fight.More than , people have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for the licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility.  Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said “We congratulate Lord Foulkes for bringing forward this Private Member’s Bill and very much hope that other Parliamentarians will support it.    “The free TV licence means so much to millions of older people and we strongly agree with him that this Conservative Government should stand by their manesto commitment and provide the funds so these free licences can continue.” Hundreds of protesters are expected to join demonstrations outside local BBC offices tomorrow hitting out at the curb. The rallies are organised by the National Pensioners Convention, whose general secretary Jan Shortt: “The buck really stops with the Government. “The Conservatives promised to keep the concession but have done everything to undermine it. “It’s not the job of the broadcaster to administer or fund part of our wider welfare policy, it’s the Government’s.” Bectu broadcasting union head Philippa Childs said: “The Government has put the BBC in an invidious position since its  manesto U-turn and we welcome any efforts by Lord George Foulkes to get this decision reversed in Westminster. “We have consistently said, on behalf of our members working at the BBC, that the over-s licence is a welfare benefit and the Government’s responsibility to pay and they should not have passed the buck.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership dirty tricks storm","story":"NewsTory leadership in dirty tricks storm as Boris Johnson plots to knock out GoveBoris Johnson has never forgiven Michael Gove for kning him out of the  leadership race - and now he could finally have his revengeShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video rory-stewart-out-after-third-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Tory leadership race has been engulfed by a dirty tricks storm as Boris Johnsonaposs backers reportedly plot to knock out Michael Gove .A rival demanded Mr Johnson disown the claims publicly today as his team were accused of dark arts and game-playing in the race to be Prime Minister.Jeremy Hunt , Michael Gove and Sajid Javid are all battling through a double ballot today to become the candidate to face  -odds frontrunner Boris Johnson in a final vote.But itaposs thought Mr Johnson has never forgiven Michael Gove for kning him out of the  leadership race, going back on a previous vow to be his running mate. So visceral is the hatred that itaposs understood one senior Tory ruled out backing Mr Gove because they feared it would enrage Mr Johnson so much. So the Dailyhas claimed Mr Johnsonaposs team could aposlendapos some of his  MP backers to Sajid Javid in todayaposs ballot.    If successful that could boost his total of  votes beyond Michael Goveaposs , knocking Mr Gove out the race. It would also clear the way for Jeremy Hunt, who won  backers yesterday, to become the aposnot Borisapos candidate. One Boris backer said they wanted Michael Gove to be humiliated. Jeremy Hunt backer Amber Rudd today demanded Boris Johnson personally disown the claims.

I think what happened is that somehow some combination of my message and momentum convinced the other camps to tighten up, so I think most of my votes will have gone to Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and some to Sajid. Boris Johnson ally Gavin Williamson - who was singled out by Mr Stewart as part of his claims - declined to comment on the dark arts claims.  It comes as the Tory race for Prime Minister enters its final phase at Westminster today, with MPs holding two ballots to knock out two of the remaining four candidates. The two who survive after the final announcement at pm will then go to a month-long vote by , Tory members.

But thereaposs everything to play for between Jeremy Huntand Michael Goveamid reports of dirty tricks and game-playing. Sajid Javidwas confident this morning despite fears heaposll be knocked out at pm today. Two ballots will be held today - clearing the way for a month-long contest between the final two candidates. They will attend  hustings with Tory members around the country and the , party members will have the final say on who enters No. Hereaposs what you need to know this morning.  MPs have already held a flurry of ballots to knock down a -strong field of candidates. Now there are four left and the final two ballots will be held today. The results will be announced at pm and pm, and each time the candidate with the fewest votes will be knocked out.Theresa May has kept her favourite a closely-guarded secret but wonapost be voting today. Instead the lame duck PM will be at a European Council summit. Boris Johnson romped home with a huge majority in the third round of voting in the Tory leadership contest. Mr Johnson gained  votes - an extra  backers since the previous round. And this morning he picked up former Brexit Secretary David Davis.Mr Johnson was followed by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt who has consistently polled in second place with  votes. Bringing up the rear was Environment Secretary Michael Gove  who also has his eyes set on second place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid lagged behind on  having picked up five extra votes to reach . But wildcard International Development Secretary Rory Stewart crashed out with just  votes - down  on the previous round of voting.Mr Stewart said: I didnapost get enough MPs to believe today - but they will. I remain deeply committed to you and to this country. THIRD ROUND Boris Johnson - Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Sajid Javid -   Rory Stewart -  SECOND ROUND Boris Johnson -   Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Rory Stewart -  Sajid Javid -  Dominic Raab -  FIRST ROUND Boris Johnson -  Jeremy Hunt -  Michael Gove -  Dominic Raab -  Sajid Javid -  Matt Hancock - Rory Stewart -   Andrea Leadsom - Mark Harper - Esther McVey -  Furious recriminations have erupted over claims of game-playing and dark arts in the leadership race. The Dailyhas claimed Mr Johnson could aposlendapos some of his  backers to Sajid Javid today in order to knock Michael Gove out of the race. Mr Johnson has never forgiven Mr Gove for kning him out of the  leadership race after previously vowing to be his running mate. So visceral is the hatred that one Tory source told the Mirror they couldnapost back Mr Gove because it would enrage Mr Johnson so much. Jeremy Hunt backer Amber Rudd today demanded Boris Johnson personally disown the claims. I would really call on Boris himself to repudiate the information that is coming out of aposfriends of Borisapos, saying this, saying one thing, she told the BBC. This is a serious moment. We donapost need that sort of game playing going on in Parliament. Sources in Mr Johnsonaposs camp played the aposs report last night. Brexiteer backer Andrea Jenkyns said although there were tricks going on in the contest, Mr Johnsonaposs campaign was not to blame. But she also told ITVaposs Peston there would be some poetic justicethe bitter rivals were in the final run-off. Meanwhile Rory Stewart also accused Boris Johnsonaposs team of dark arts before his total mysteriously dropped from  to  last night. But after the result he told ITVaposs Peston: I donapost think it was dirty tricks by Boris. I think what happened is that somehow some combination of my message and momentum convinced the other camps to tighten up, so I think most of my votes will have gone to Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and some to Sajid. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to warn the next Prime Minister he will have to call an election or a second referendum to break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament.Mr Hammond is set to urge the remaining leadership candidates to be “honest with the public” about the risks of no-deal. Heaposll also say the £bn put aside in the economy wonapost be available to cut taxes or boost spendingthereaposs No Deal. In a speech in London, he is expected to say: “It may be that I’m wrong, and a new leader will persuade Parliament to accept the deal it has already rejected. “Or that the European Union does a -degree U-turn and re-opens the Withdrawal Agreement. ButI’m not,the deal the current PM has negotiated is, in fact, the best deal possible - and Parliament continues to reject both it and No Deal, then the question to the candidates is not “What is your plan ” but “What is your plan B ”. “If the new Prime Minister cannot end the deadlock in Parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse. “Becausehe fails, his job will be on the line – and so, too, will the jobs and prosperity of millions of our fellow citizens.”  Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has spoken out against no-deal-Brexit backers as EU leaders prepare to meet in Brussels. He said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK. Mr Rutte told the BBCaposs Today programme: With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country. It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable. And he said the next leader must be ready to be flexible on Brexit.

That is no longer the case. Patients at a trust in the north-west of England have been told they will have to go privatethey want treatments once routine on the NHS. An alarming precedent is being set which threatens to undermine the foundations of our national health service. We are seeing the consequences of the funding squeeze imposed by the Conservatives. Cash-strapped commissioning groups are having to ration operations once free. As a result, people are being turned away, often in serious discomfort, unless they have the money to pay for private healthcare.    We are seeing the core values of the NHS being destroyed by a Tory regime which has starved it of funds and then allowed private firms to feast on people’s pain and misery. Empty words THE hollow promises of Theresa May were exposed yesterday when she was challenged by Jeremy Corbyn on the Government’s response to the Grenfell tragedy. The Labour leader, who praised our Never Again campaign, asked the PM to explain why hundreds of blocks still have dangerous cladding. He also wanted to know why sprinklers had not been retrofitted and why no action was taken to improve tenants’ rights. Mrs May failed to answer any questions. In the wake of the disaster, she vowed to do everything she could to keep people safe.    Her record tells a dferent story. Fire regulations have not been updated, tenants are still denied a voice and firefighter numbers have been cut. Sympathetic words are not enough. The survivors of the fire should not still be waiting for her Government to make good on its word.

The couple have now been forced to move out of their home on the River Bure at Horning in Norfolk, while they wait to find out whether it will have to be demolished.    Signs have been erected around the property with the words Danger. Unsafe. Ken said there had been no warning signs that the west side of their home starting to sink and that it simply happened overnight, leaving them devastated.

So sad to see this. The three-bedroom house offers a large garden with a river frontage, along with allocated boat mooring and fishing opportunities. It also includes a master with king-sized bed and balcony, a well-equipped kitchen and a light and airy sitting room leading out onto a large riverside sundeck. Over the last five years  properties have been sold on the road in the village which has shops, pubs and restaurants.    A Broads Authority spokesman said: It is a huge shame that this lovely cottage appears to be in such a precarious position. Unfortunately it is something that can be an ongoing danger for properties built on unstable ground. We wish the owners all the best as they assess what can be done.

She claims the food had been eaten and could no longer be seen. It was absolutely ridiculous, Mrs Fricker said. It was the end corner of the sausage roll. I just dropped it for the pigeons that were there, and he came out of nowhere, stuck a badge in my face and started reading me my rights.

I asked him what he was doing with my information and he wouldn’t answer.    I wasn’t given a chance to speak. He didn’t explain why he was in my face until he had my name and address. Mrs Fricker said the food had already been eaten by the birds. The crumbs were already gone before he actually stopped me, she claimed. He said it was a substantial amount of food. It wasn’t. It was the corner of the pastry - the little tiny bit at the bottom. I told him I was feeding the pigeons and he said he couldnapost see any pigeons.

But this year Kate has surpassed herself and her fashion choices have garnered more praise than ever. Subtle changes have meant she has grown into her style as the mother-of-three has become older – and gained more confidence. While not deviating far from her signature style, she has modernised it. Kate has clearly widened her scope of go-to designers, making way for some more daring choices. Stepping out in labels like Gucci, Missoni and Elie Saab have added to the opinion she’s having a “fashion moment”.  The stunning dusky pink Gucci chfon gown she wore to the VA in February was Oscar-worthy. And Tuesday’s cornflower blue Elie Saab gown for Ascot was another sign that Kate is enjoying experimenting with new styles. Susan Kelly from website whatkatewore, says: “The Duchess’s style has been more fashion-forward over the last six to  months and there is one term that sums up Kate exploring more adventurous styles: self-confidence.”  When the Duchess wore a Gucci pussy-bow blouse everyone assumed she’s worn it back to front by mistake. But it was a confident styling decision made by Kate, who thought it looked better the other way round. A fitted green Emilia Wickstead dress was another fashion highlight. But it’s not just her formal wear that has been transformed, she also looked every inch the off-duty mum as she unveiled her Back to Nature Garden at this year’s Cha Flower Show in a pair of Massimo Dutti culottes with a crisp white MIH floral shirt and a pair of Superga plimsols.  Later that day she changed into a distinctive, longline Erdem dress teamed with a pair of casual wedges. This year has also seen Kate be more confident in trousers. She showed she can still shine dressed down in a blue jacket and her faithful knee-high Penelope Chilvers boots while she also paired skinny jeans with a red jacket and heels for a trip to North Wales.  Susan adds: “The Duchess not only looks comfortable with her public commitments she looks like she is flourishing.” Some have attributed her new oomph to her new stylist Ginnie Chadwyck-Healey who is covering her long-time PA and stylist Natasha Archer while she’s on maternity leave. Kate has traded in her trusty nude court shoes for elegant designer heels. She chose a sparkly pair of Jimmy Choos when she recycled a Barbara Casasola dress to a charity dinnerthis month.And a polka dot Alessandra Rich silk dress worn was highlighted by a pair of powder blue Gianvito Rossi shoes.  While Kate’s heel height may have gone up, her hemlines seem to have come down as she has found her right dress coat– wearing them slightly lower on the knee. Far from radically changing her style it could simply be the case that she’s just settled into it...

Ms Coulson paid £ to undergo the assessment herself and £, for a private assessment for her daughter. The mum-of-three said her diagnosis has helped her make sense of why she has struggled with certain things in le.She told HullLive : My diagnosis certainly made all my leaposs struggles make sense.   As a child I always struggled with friendships, never liked busy places and have a lot of sensory issues, very similar to Sadie, but I had no support and grew up learning to manage. I failed at a lot of things and learnt to avoid the things that overwhelmed me. A lot of Sadieaposs quirks were very similar to mine and the more research I did, the more I questioned my own le and struggles. During Sadieaposs private assessment, the paediatrician make a few remarks about how itaposs often genetic and she noticed similarities in me while I was there all day. Ms Coulson regrets not being diagnosed with Autism sooner. She said: I wish I had been diagnosed sooner. I spent most of my le struggling and not knowing why, I struggled with feeling weird and dferent and the odd one out. Sadie was so delighted when I was diagnosed, she said we were a team. People always say a diagnosis is a label. I say itaposs a not a label, its your self-identity and self-confidence and it allows you to learn your strengths and to no longer focus on the negatives.    If I had known itaposs because I was autistic, I could have become more confident with who I was as a person. Now Iaposm diagnosed, I have an identity, I am far more confident about who I am, and I am able to teach Sadie how to be happy with herself and never excuse her traits as they are a part of her. Ms Coulson said having autism helps her to help Sadie but said that she is unable to help assist in some circumstances. She said: Itaposs amazing being able to support her by using my experiences and points of view, but it can be very dficult bringing up an autistic child when you are also autistic, no autistic person is the same. Me and Sadie are like chalk and cheese, our sensory dficulties are almost opposite. Sadie loves to be tactile, and I hate being touched. But I allow her to get the physical contact she needs, because at the end of the day, sheaposs my daughter. Ms Coulson said she has learned to tolerate the things that overwhelm her. She said: I bottle it all up all day and Iaposm able to shut myself down to recover. Sadie has meltdowns, sheaposs too young to be able to control and manage her emotions.  I however, have shutdowns. Thataposs where I just need to be alone and quiet. I am emotionally and physically unable to interact because I have built up being overwhelmed all say dealing with Sadie, my other children, being a local dyspraxia coordinator, paperwork and tribunals for Sadieaposs support. Everything is a constant battle. Itaposs really hard work. But I am very open now about being autistic - mainly in the hope Sadie sees that I am confident about it so she can become anything she wants. I am a nursery nurse, but I failed at university when I wanted to be a teacher, because I socially couldnapost cope. That makes me sad. Sadie wants to be a zoo vet, she is obsessed with reptiles as am I, and I want her to believe she can achieve anything. Ms Coulson said Sadie understands a lot about autism. When she was younger she would cry herself to sleep, asking aposwhy am I dferent apos - but now she knows why. She said: When she got formally diagnosed she was happy and singing and dancing and making a song up in the garden singing aposI am autistic and I love it.apos Itaposs part of her and her self-identity so it will help her in the future to understand herself.

He organised a fawning Jubilee concert for the Queen and was given an OBE which clearly stood for “Outrageously Brown-nosing Elizabeth” after which Prince Charles called him a National Treasure.  But it transpired he was a Keeper Of The National Treasure as he wasn’t paying all of his taxes. Worse, he tried to win the youth vote for the Tories by saying “There’s no one more with-it than David Cameron.” As Danny Dyer would say: “what an effing Take That.”By Brian ReadeAdam Faith Music would have been better of without Terence Nelhams-Wright, better known to his fans – including my teenage girlfriend – as Adam Faith.  His love-sick melodies were all the rage from the early sixties when he recorded Poor Meand Someone Else’s Baby . He rivalled Clf Richard in popularity, competing for the most sugary lyrics with songs like “I Love You, You Love Me” . His most embarrassing single was “Lonely Pup In A Christmas Shop” Faith died spectacularly aged  of a heart attack in bed with his young mistress. Sadly, his narcissistic, whining style is back in fashion.By Paul RoutledgeChris De Burgh Chris de bloody Burgh ruined my teenage years.  It was the era of punk and new wave, rebellion in the air with another world possible. Mates pogoed to exciting bands such as the Sex Pistols, Stranglers, Clash and Jam. Yours truly queued at Newcastle City Hall’s stage door to meet an unfashionable chanteur. Looking back it was inexplicable madness yet I liked folk music and in my defence it was before Lady in Red. I’ve kept de Burgh’s first four albums on their scratchy plastic. £ each or a fiver for the lot. Expunge him from history and I could’ve been another mutinous teen instead of a blushing ftysomething.By Kevin MaguireHeavy Metal Aggressive, loud and with no discernible melody, I absolutely cannot stand heavy metal. I’m sure that lovers of this baffling genre would point out where I’m wrong, but I just don’t get it.  With screeching guitars, thrashing drums and usually a terrying-looking man in need of a wash shrieking down a microphone, apparently in a really bad mood, is this meant to be music  It all sounds the same! A fan of Iron Maiden and Def Leppard  Well aren’t you just super cool. I’m well aware that my taste for Take That, musicals and a rousing power ballad doesn’t give me any musical credibility - but I’ll keep my jazz hands over a headache any day.By Sara WallisAnyone Can Fall in Love I’ve never been a fan of the TV theme tune so popular that someone, somewhere believes it has to be turned into a pop song.  There are lots of examples but the one I still have nightmares about is the EastEnder’s aberration, Anyone Can Fall In Love. Decent, catchy and a soap opera staple. What it didn’t need was for Anita Dobson to perform it on Top Of The Pops, right. I still can’t believe it reached number four in the charts in . Music history would survive just fine without the contribution of that track andothers like it.By Darren LewisJedward I’ve interviewed some true musical legends – Ringo Starr, Tom Jones, Lionel Richie and Gary Barlow .  But my brush with the spiky-mopped X Factor stars was so bizarre it still makes my hair stand on end thinking about it. I was locked in a small office with the Grimes twins as scores of adoring fans screamed outside and the boys serenaded them out of the window. Jedward were so high on sugary drinks they were bouncing off the walls and the hour-long interview was a farce. I failed to get even one coherent quote out of them and my boss wasn’t happy.

Sadly, he never had the chance to use it - and the money was used to pay for his funeral. Now an investigation into the treatment of Mr Smith has shockingly found that the DWP aposfollowed policyapos. It comes after there were widespread calls for an independent inquiry into his treatment, including from Birkenhead MP and Work and Pensions Committee chair Frank Field.    He wrote to Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd who would not grant a full inquiry - instead only ordering an internal DWP review. The results of that review have now been revealed. Writing to Mr Field, Ms Rudd states: This review has now concluded and shows that whilst the policy guidance was followed in Mr Smithaposs case, there were crucial safeguarding opportunities which were missed by the Department. The review has identied areas where we need to change our policy and we will be implementing these changes to ensure our most vulnerable claimants are protected.    The letter states that the changes will include:- Identying other trigger points for information sharing between lines to improve, join up and provide more holistic support -Improving awareness across benefit lines of how new awards to or changes in benefit entitlement can materially affect other benefits in payment or under appeal - and encouraging or requiring staff to look for an act on these these links. - Identying the opportunities to embed these recommendations effectively and quickly across multiple customer journeysMs Rudd wrote: The Department will be working at pace to ensure that these are embedded and that vulnerable claimants are receiving the best possible support from the Department. I am adamant that we will learn important lessons from this tragic case and make changes to protect people like Mr Smith in future.    Mr Field was seriously unimpressed with the lack of humanity and abundance of jargon in a response about the death of a man so clearly failed by the system. He told the ECHO: ‘This letter heavily disguises the fact that we’re talking about a man who lost his le, not a package that got lost within the DWP.

The weather should be fairly nice today, with sunny intervals across parts of the UK this morning and consistent sunshine later on in central and north-east England. Things will really pick up for the Summer Solstice tomorrow when much of the country will bask in sunshine, with Wales and south-west England enjoying the best weather. Temperatures will be fairly low, with highs of around C, although it will feel a lot warmer thanks to low winds and little cloud.    Saturday will see the mercury rise slightly as all of Wales and sections of England enjoy a sunny day, although Sunday will be overcast. A netweather.tv spokesman said: Friday is the Summer Solstice and in a timely manner for a change, high pressure will build in from the south during the day, so although there will be some showers at first affecting mostly northern and northwestern parts, many places will be or become dry and fine through the day. Just a few showers may keep going in the far north-west.

Laura Hood, , wrongly told police the driver had stopped his cab at the side of the road and sexually assaulted her in the back seat whilst he was giving her a lt home at the end of the evening, it was said. Detectives investigated Hoodaposs claims during which they arrested Haroon Yousaf and also the driver of a dferent taxi with a similar number plate. Mr Yousaf, , who was detained in front of colleagues at a cab rank spent a total  hours in custody and had to give intimate samples before he was released without charge and exonerated of any wrongdoing. It was claimed police suspected he had been ly accused when he gave details of a tracking device linked to the black cab which showed the vehicle had been driven straight to Hoodaposs home in Stockport, Greater Manchester without stopping.  There was also no evidence of physical contact between them. The other suspect was also cleared of any wrongdoing and Hood was subsequently charged with faking her account. Details emerged at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, as she denied perverting the course of justice. If it were not for that tracker data Mr Yousaf may have found himself on trial for rape because the defendant made up a story about him, said Geoff Whelan prosecuting. Perhaps only the defendant knows why she would fabricate such an allegation, but make it up she did. A  allegation is a very serious matter. She accepts that she was in Mr Yousafaposs taxi and she accepts that he drove her home. She further accepts that Mr Yousaf did not rape her - but says, somehow that she honestly believed she was raped whilst in that taxi. The incident occurred on January   after Hood, from Stockport had been out with friends at Revolution bar at the Deansgate Locks complex in Manchester city centre. Mr Yousaf had just dropped off a fare when Hood got into his vehicle at .am and asked to be taken home. Mr Whelan added: She appeared to be drunk as she did so and said she just wanted to go home as she had lost her friends and her mobile phone. She said she had £ and asked how much it was going to be. Mr Yousaf gave her an estimate of about £ and she asked to be taken to a bank. Mr Yousaf drove her to a Tesco Express where CCTV footage showed the taxi stopping there at .am with the defendant getting out to use the cash machine.  By .am the taxi was driving off again and Mr Yousaf followed the directions on his satnav and took her straight home and reached the destination. The fare was around £, and the defendant gave him £ and said keep the change and paid the money through the slot in the middle of all black cab taxis. Mr Yousaf then thanked her then turned around and drove back to town. That  minute journey was in all respects entirely unremarkable. But at . when the defendant got home, it seems she was quite noisy and her mother askingshe was ok. The defendant then went upstairs to her mother and stepfatheraposs bedroom where she was sobbing uncontrollably as she came into the room. Her mother asked her what was wrong and she had lost her phone. She was crying, shaking and unable to breathe and then said that she had been raped. Her stepfather phoned the police and the defendant said she had lost her phone in Revolution and had started to panic and asked a taxi driver take her to Stockport. She said that they were going down the road and thought it was strange because he turned left when they live on the right. She said that he stopped and the driver got in the back of the cab, grabbed her and pulled her knickers down. Her mother asked her why she didnapost fight back and the defendant said that she was scared and that she thought that it would get worseshe tried to fight back. She said that he dropped her off at the end of the road and that he wouldnapost drop her off outside the house. The defendant was hysterical as she was speaking to her mother.

Angela Ellis-Jones ed to her house in Sutton, Surrey following three weeks with her mother in Wales to discover an ugly metal postbox attached to the front door. It was clear that somebody had been trying to steal her post. What wasnapost as immediately obvious was the s someone had gone to to steal Ms Ellis-Jones identity and with it, her house. The incident remained in the back of my mind, but it was not until I received a letter from the Land Registry two months later that I discovered the real reason my post had been targeted, she explained.    The letter was entitled ‘Completion of Registration’ and went on to state that the property now belonged to a total stranger. Someone had stolen my home! After the reality sank in, I felt frightened and feared for my safety. With a house worth this much, what s would they go to get me out of the way  When she contacted the Land Registry Ms Ellis-Jones was told a solicitor in Tooting, London had confirmed the identity of a woman who had wanted to transfer the propertyaposs ownership. On October  a notice of the application was sent to the homeowner, who was given just  days to respond to it. With Ms Ellis-Jones away from home for so long and with her letterbox high-jacked, she never received the letter. On November  her property was officially transferred to someone . She continued: The first I knew that my property had been stolen was when I received the completion of registration notice later in November — once again, not sent by tracked post. The fraudster had also paid the £ transfer fee by postal order, which does not require you to have a bank account, securing their anonymity. What followed was a battle to get my home back, and at times it felt like the law was on the criminal’s side. The Land Registry viewed the issue as a ‘civil matter’ rather than fraud. Because the home now technically belonged to another woman, the Land Registry had to track her down to ask whether she objected to Ms Ellis-Joneaposs name being put back on the register. This took a further three weeks. She added: I was told that, had the fraudster lodged an objection, the ‘parties’ would have to negotiate as to who rightfully owned my house, which could take months. If we reached deadlock, the case could go to the Lands Tribunal, dragging out the process even longer. Thankfully, matters never got that far. The fraudster must have realised the game was up, as she offered no objection to me reclaiming my house. And on February  this year, I was told it was mine once again. Although things worked out for the best in the end,she had spent more time at her motheraposs the situation could have been far worse. I might have been days away from having my house snatched and let or sold without there being anything I could do about it, she said. After all the time spent on this, and the distress, I believe I deserve compensation. Yet the Land Registry has neither apologised nor admitted it let a fraudster slip through the net. I was the victim of a very serious fraud. A spokesman for the government body told the Mirror online: HM Land Registry is doing all it can to minimise the risk of property fraud and to maintain the integrity of the Land Register. Our counter-fraud unit works closely with the police. Since , HM Land Registry has prevented  fraudulent applications, representing properties valued in excess of £,,. If someone is defrauded of their registered property, our state indemnity means they will usually be compensated for any resulting loss.

And when questioned about these expenses, the bride is said to have shrugged them off because it was HER DAY.    Unsure of where to begin with the story, the woman takes readers back to the engagement party, where the lucky members of the wedding party were first selected. She wrote: First of all, she had an engagement party to kick off what is to be  months of constant celebrations leading up to the big day. This party was complete with personalised wine bottles for each of her selected bridesmaids and MOH.[The bridal party] were required to go dress shopping with her, then shoe shopping, then accessories shopping. Once she was able to find the perfect ensemble for her day, they were required to go shopping for their dresses and shoes and accessories. They were also required to have professional hair and make-up done.   After paying hundreds of pounds for their outfits, then came the over-the-top bachelorette party, which lasted a week and involved renting limos. She planned a week-long event that consisted of renting a luxurious house in Napa Valley, complete with limo rentals to go wine tasting for three days, the woman continues. However at this point, the brideaposs long-term BFF decided enough was enough and complained about how much they had spent on her wedding. Bridezilla tells her point-blank, aposThis is MY DAY and Iaposm the ONLY one that matters.apos Fast-forward a few hours and Bridezilla kicks her out of the weddingand says she never wants to see her again. Another bridesmaid decided sheaposd had enough too and bailed out on the Napa trip. WOW.    The rest of the wedding party continued to put up with the Bridezilla and saw it through to the big day - where instead of giving gts, they were asked to donate yet more money towards the coupleaposs honeymoon fund. At the end of the post, the woman broke down all of the costs the bridesmaids incurred, and the numbers will shock you: Attendant dresses , shoes , accessories , professional hair and makeup , Napa Valley house rental, airfare round-trip , food drinks for the week , limo rentals to go wine tasting and one le-long friendship. Many people were shocked by the costs of these things. One person said: Jesus for my sisters wedding we each paid  for Our dresses - we all did our own hair makeup nails. I don’t get why people feel the need to splurge so much for a one day ordeal.A second commented: How selfish do you have to be to demand so much time and money from the people you love,  especially  when you alone are dictating the cost ! !A third added: What a spoiled, entitled little f***ing brat.

According to the NHS, the nasty bowel condition commonly follows treatment with antibiotics— and a follow-up course usually sorts it out. But a persistent infection can cause serious bowel problems for sufferers who already have compromised bowel health and whose gut bacteria prove resistant to more antibiotic treatment. For those unfortunate sufferers, science has strongly backed faecal transplants to provide them with welcome relief. Associate Professor Andrew Holmes, a microbiology expert at The University of Sydney’s Charles Perks Centre, told the news site the transplants were “spectacularly successful,” with cures possible within two days. He added that the stigma of a poo translant was no barrier for recipients desperate for a cure from their unpleasant symptoms. “Fear of missing out is a bigger problem than fear of faeces. Andyou bounce back to health after treatment, no one is likely to hold it against you for whatever s*** you ate.” The transplants come from poo banks, furnished with generous donations from the possessors of healthy guts.     Donors are able to drop off their deposits at locations around Australia, such as the Centre for Digestive Health in Sydney, which reportedly estimates one-in- donors are generally found to be viable. The faecal matter is transplanted by route of an enema up the recipientsapos anus, or turned into pill form which pioneering poo transplant expert Professor Thomas Barody reportedly refers to as crapsules. But hes says demand for the popular treatment—which has its roots in ancient Chinese medicine, but has only more recently developed as a new frontier for Western therapeutics—has caused a stool shortage in the land Down Under. That demand could only grow in futurefaecal matter transplants become more commonplace. The latest developments in medical science has seen the gut emerge as the human bodyaposs most under-rated organ.     Constant streams of new research are increasing our comprehension of the importance of the gut microbiome - our very own personalised little families of trillions of bacteria— to a healthy, ing body. Scientists now know that an estimated  per cent of the human bodyaposs key neurotransmitter serotonin—the aposhappyapos hormone—is made in the digestive tract.As a result, altered levels of the hormone in the gut are now being linked to mood disorders and common complaints such as irritable bowel syndrome .   One recent study found the faecal transplants can even help improve the memory and brain s of patients suffering from severe liver disease.And more recent research suggesting faecal transplants could in be used to treat autism caused a wave of excitement worldwide. While the international medical community has been at pains to point out such research is in its early stages, thesmall US study involving  autistic children found an improvement in their symptoms and signs of the disorder two years after they received a faecal transplant was seen as a breakthough. Autism is commonly associated with dficulty in communication and interactions with other people, but is also linked with digestive woes including diarrhoea and constipation. Eight of the children involved in the study no longer fit the criteria for a faecal transplant, and there was a  per cent reduction in gut symptoms over-all.     The developments in gut health studies also offer new opportunities for the booming wellbeing industry. Experts have recently developed a DIY test which examines the bacteria in your microbiome – and can predict diseases you are at risk of, giving gut-gazers a chance at diet and lestyle to help ward off diseases.That could present a promising future for labs developing such oddities as frozen apospoo pills.aposThe pills might sound unpalatable, but they have proven effective as a more pleasant-to-stomach treatment of conditions like CDAD. The Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which has been busy blending and sieving donor faeces and then freezing them inside capsules - says its treatment was  per cent effective within just two days for CDAD patients who swallowed the pills.

He also takes pitch bookings.Many a team secretary is glad of Bob’s assistance when a pitch has to be booked at short notice and Bob is readily on the end of a phone to get things organised.Come rain, hail or shine he’s out early on match days to make sure pitches are playable – andthey’re not he sets about making them fit for games to go ahead.And then there are the swans and the ducks.One of the parks Bob oversees is the South Inch whose pond is home to these feathered friends.The octogenarian casts a beady eye over them and, should something be amiss, he contacts the relevant authorities.And, not content with doing all that, he acts as a taxi driver to his golf playing grandsons, Challenge Tour player Bradley Neil and his brother, Connor, who is a top performer in the Scottish amateur ranks.They are often spotted being ferried around with Bob at the wheel.Why, though, when most folk have long since retired, does Bob keep going  “It’s simple,” he said as he chatted at the newly refurbished South Inch cafe.“I enjoy it and I’m fit enough to do it. I have no plans to pack it in either.“I’ve always been keen on football and love the football side of the job, making sure pitches and changing rooms are OK.”And that is despite having battled cancer as well as being diabetic.His working le began grafting in agriculture along with his dad when he was , followed by a stint in the Royal Marines.Then, as now, that showed Bob has the physical ability to cope with the rigours of outdoor le.After leaving the Marines, he worked on a farm, followed by  years in a Kirriemuir jute mill.Then came stints at the Tower bakery and Elder and Paton’s car body repair shop in Perth.Then it was back to the outdoor le with the parks department.His love of sport filtered its way down to his son Eric who had a decent football career and his daughter Mandy who is an accomplished bowls player.And grandsons Bradley and Connor are continuing to do well on the local and international golfing stages.One of the football teams Bob ran, Strathtay Boys, won the Scottish U  Cup in  and, to players these days, Bob is still a winner."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d077b38544ac4.63654866-600x564.jpg ","title":"ayr skipper docherty backs former teammates to shine at dundee and united","story":"They may be going into the new season as rivals not team-mates but Ayr United captain Ross Docherty has backed Liam Smith and Declan McDaid to make a big impact at our city clubs.Right-back Liam Smith has checked in at Dundee United for the upcoming Championship campaign, while winger Declan McDaid has also left the Honest Men to link up at Dundee.Ayr skipper Docherty rates both men very highly and expects them to shine as they battle it out for promotion from the second tier alongside his side and others.Having experienced relegation in , before winning League One and finishing fourth in the Championship last season together with Ayr, ‘Doc’ believes McDaid has experience that belies his  years and has proven quality.“Declan came in at the end of our last spell in the Championship when we got relegated,” the -year-old said.“He had a couple of injuries and that set him back but he kicked on when we got promoted right into finishing fourth last season and the play-offs.“He has the pace, he is quite powerful for a winger but he can maybe do a bit more work with his final ball.“However, when he is on it, he is unplayable and will do well for Dundee.”With -year-old former Hearts and St Mirren defender Smith, midfielder Docherty believes the Tangerines have got a player on their hands.The former Livingston and Airdrieonians man thinks he has the makings of a Premiership performer and admits Ayr boss Ian McCall was surprised to pick him up last summer.Docherty added: “I think the manager was shocked to get him when he did.“He was at Hearts and did well for St Mirren. I think he got in the Championship Team of the Year when they won the league in  so he’s a top player.“He was good defensively for us and got up and down all day long.“That’s what you’re looking for from a full-back nowadays.”Losing Smith and McDaid, along with last season’s Championship top scorer Lawrence Shankland, goalkeeper Ross Doohan and defender Michael Rose was a blow for the Honest Men.However, Paisley-born Docherty insists with most of their squad from last season signed up, they can make a push for promotion once again.Experienced heads like former Terror Mark Kerr, Steven Bell, Michael Moffat, Andy Geggan, ex-Dundee man Jamie Adams and Craig Moore have agreed new deals since the end of the last campaign and Docherty has warned they should not be counted out of competing at the top of the table again.He added: “The team did so well and maybe over-achieving has cost us a little.“With that you are going to lose a couple of players.“The big-hitters are away but we have a lot of players signed up who know the club and what it’s all about.”A four-season veteran at Somerset Park, Docherty has made  appearances for Ayr.However, in recent times, he has been dogged by injury and has only had  run outs in each of the past two seasons.He believes he has put those fitness woes behind him and aims to get himself back in the engine-room of a successful team.Docherty added: “Last season I was coming back from injury and once the season started it was hard to get in.“We were doing so well and I was happy to play a role but it was a bit frustrating.“Hopefully, I can be a lot more involved in a good season this time out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car -

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article16536632.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/4_shr_ayp_260216nick.jpg","title":"bulldozers flatten buildings ayrshire main 16536673#comments","story":"NewsBulldozers about to flatten buildings in Ayrshire Main StreetShareBySarah Hilley:,  JUN NewsPrestwick Main Street, general view \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn old police station and social work office are set to be demolished next month.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay.

My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause. Thousands of pensioners plan to march this week on BBC sites across the UK in protest at the corporationrsquos announcement that from  it will stop giving free TV licences to everyone aged over , at a cost of poundm a year, moving instead to a means-tested system where only those claiming pension credit will be exempt from paying the pound. annual fee.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabThe National Pensioners Conventionwhich is organising the protest, off the back of an Age UK petition that has already garnered more than half a million signatures, has called the BBCrsquos move ldquocallous and cruel.The NPC claims the issue is ldquouniting generations when the reality, of course, is that universal benefits for pensioners like this one and the winter fuel allowance ndash which costs around poundbn a year ndashincreasingly ides society by age, with the gap between older, private-pensioned, property-rich haves and younger, debt-ridden have-nots growing by the day.What really dispirits me about the outcry over this move, however, is the way in which large sections of society have fallen hook, line and sinker for the Tory ploy to blame the BBC. The corporation was, after all, left in a no-win situation when it was landed with free licences as part of its settlement in . If it continues to fund them for all over s, the very services viewers and listeners say they value, that mark the corporation out from lesser commercial broadcasters ndash the peerless radio output, BBC and BBC ndash would have to go.Read more: Pensioners to march in fury over BBC licence fee grabAnd make no mistake, this isnrsquot just an opportunistic shting of responsibility for an unpopular policy from Government to BBC, though it seems ridiculous that anyone would believe a broadcaster would or should be in charge of welfare policy. Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10009730.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-hotel-group-macdonald-in-blockbuster-sale-deal","story":"The Scottish hotels group, the vast majority of which is owned by -year-old industry veteran Donald Macdonald and his family, had total debt in excess of pound million more than  years ago, deputy chairman and managing director Gordon Fraser noted.Mr Fraser revealed the grouprsquos ability to invest had been constrained in the wake of the global financial crisis, which got under way in earnest in , as it cut its debt.He said: ldquoSince , we have not had a capital expenditure facility from the bank.

Glasgow introduced a Low Emission Zonelast December, though it currently only covers % of buses . Under Scottish Government direction, all four of our biggest cities must have taken similar measures by next year.Edinburgh has also joined the Open Streets movement, closing its city centre roads to traffic on the first Sunday of every month as part of an -month pilot programme.Some critics consider projects such as this to be tinkering at the edges rather than really getting to grips with the air pollution problem.Nevertheless, those promoting todayrsquos initiative believe that it will make a positive impression.John Bynorth, who is Policy and Communications Officer for Environmental Protection Scotland, which co-ordinates Clean Air Day north of the border on behalf of the Scottish Government, says that he believes there is now more awareness of climate change issues and this will feed into enthusiasm for todayrsquos events.ldquoThis is particularly true among young people. It seemed to kick off earlier in the year when we saw school pupils protesting in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness.Edinburgh residents and visitors make the most of traffic-free streets.ldquoThat really started impacting on the media. Then we had the Extinction Rebellion protests which were huge and very high profile, and both Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn have made declarations on a climate emergency.Bynorth says there is a lot more engagement with Clean Air day this year than last. ldquoWith schools, itrsquos absolutely huge.

Plockton High School is bringing a Clean Air Day theme to classes, with pupils discussing and debating air quality and what can be done to improve it.In Crieff, Perthshire, where the pollution- generating A road runs directly through the town, a local primary school is taking part in an air quality workshop.Other engagement events include an initiative to encourage active travel organised by Falkirk Active Travel Hub at Forth Valley Royal Hospital and free breakfast vouchers for NHS staff who cycle or walk to work at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock.Some leading figures in the environmental sector are, however, ambivalent about how much of an impact Clean Air Day will actually have. ldquoItrsquos going to be quite limited, says Gavin Thomson, Air Pollution Campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland.ldquoI think itrsquos a good idea and Itrsquos a good opportunity to take stock and look at what is being done on air quality, but to achieve big improvements as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we need to start seeing bolder action from both our councils and the Scottish Government.Thomson backs the commitment to the low emission zones in Scotlandrsquos main cities, pointing out it is something Friends of the Earth has been arguing for over years.ldquoIn reality, though, itrsquos not yet clear whether theyrsquore going to be as ambitious as they could be.ldquoWe have an incongruity between the rhetoric, which is pretty promising, and the policies we are seeing at a local level.

Thatrsquos a laudable objective. But the strategy to achieve this is dafter than any character Jerry Lewis or Norman Wisdom created.Comedy writing has never been about defending the patriarchy. More often than not itrsquos been about two blokes sitting in a flat throwing ideas back and forward while eating caramel wafers and sooking strong tea. This double male world usually features one typing while the other lays on a couch scratching his bits and trying to come up with a killer line to end the first scene, all in time for Countdown starting.This female-free writing form has resulted in the likes of Steptoe and Son, The Likely Lads, Porridge, Dadrsquos Army, Are You being Served It Ainrsquot Half Hot Mum, and Hi-de-Hi, all classic sitcoms written by the likes of Galton and Simpson, Clement and La Frenais and Croft and Perry.Andthis new mixed writing team rule were to apply to the BBCthis would mean our own comedy duos such as Still Gamersquos Kiernan and Hemphill and Burnistounrsquos Florence and Connell would be wasting the caramel wafer money. Two Doors Downrsquos creators Carlyle and Sharp would have had to squeeze an extra chair into Carlylersquos parentsrsquo garden shedand hope the added voice didnrsquot obscure their own.Saskia Schusterrsquos bosses should point out her virtue signalling is not only wrong, itrsquos stupid, isive and ill-thought out.They should underline the idea that writing success generally emerges from a connection of minds, two people on the same page, literally and figuratively, two people in love with the same idea, of how to create a character, a plot line, a set-up, gag. To impose an addition to the process ndash regardless of sex ndash is to deny the alchemy already apparent.What Schuster is doing in demanding female representation in every comedy script submission is to create arranged marriages. But the chances of such marriages producing offspring that will become loved by a nation are slim.There is no doubt that some of our television writing in the past has had a smear of sexism. You could argue the Pythons team could have done with the addition of a female writer to reduce the bikinis on display. But itrsquos also important to remember women have never been banned from writing for television think Carla Lane, Jenner Saunders, Victoria Wood. Itrsquos even more important to point out the most successful comedy writers right now are female: Fleabagrsquos Phoebe Waller-Bridge has Killing Eve and the upcoming Bond movie to her credits, Derry Girlsrsquo creator Lisa McGhee is on her third network series. Male-female writing teams already work,allowed to emerge naturally, as was the case with John Cleese and Connie Boothrsquos Fawlty Towers, and is the case with Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaneyrsquos very funny C Catastrophe.Yes, we would all love gender balance in TV writing. Last year, women wrote % of TV episodes. But the way to bring about balance is not to squeeze a female into the garden shed. The way forward is for television to invest in more writer workshops, encourage the likes of female writing collectives such as Glasgowrsquos based Witsherface,which features the likes of Karen Dunbar.The way forward is for teachers to show episodes of Derry Girls to th year pupils and say ldquoPay attention, girls. You too can have a career in TV writingyou can come up with something as funny as this.So letrsquos have a re-think, ITV. And bear this in mind the sweet BBC sitcom success Mum was written by a man. Which tells you that being funny isnrsquot gender related. We can write for each other, that comedy isnrsquot sex prescriptive.Look at your real failings, ITV.

The majority of the aforesaid members are over  years of age and appear to care little for the unprecedented economic, social and political vandalism that those who come after them will be bequeathed. Attitudes are hardening across the country and those who desire real social democracy will not, I fear, find it in any future Conservative Government. English nationalism, fuelled by Brexit as well as an international fillip for those on the far right, must now wag the Tory party dog for the immediate political future.Ruth Davidsons anti-independence mantra now looks hollow and isolated and Scottish Conservatives must undergo an existential self-analysis. Many Scottish voters are now disillusioned and feel impotent in the face of a future Boris Johnson premiership and its implications of American hegemony.Independence has never looked so irresistible. The only question is:not now, then when Owen Kelly, Stirling.IAIN Macwhirter paints a rather bleak view of Scotlandrsquos future in the UK and appears to use that to justy resorting to an independence referendum or some other means that is not founded on a legally binding agreement with the UK Government .It is surprising to read a serious commentator talk of \"extra-legal means of securing Scottish independence\". Surely the SNP leadership can wait until the fog of Brexit clears, to seethe public mood in Scotland is genuinely behind revisiting the issue of our membership of the UK. To push on when the majority opinion is against holding a vote any time soon appears to be unnecessarily provocative and likely to be self-defeating in terms of how people will vote.I do not favour breaking up the UK, but equally I accept that majority opinion in Scotland must ultimately be respected. Yet of course, it was not so very long ago that we all put a great deal of focus on the issue of independence and gave a clear answer. Meanwhile circumstances have changed but is seems that the weight of opinion on this matter has not. For all our sakes, I hope that cooler heads in the Scottish Government manage to steer away from inflicting further and unnecessary discord on us when we are neither ready for it or wanting to compound the constitutional uncertainty of recent years.Keith Howell, West Linton.SOME of your columnists are working themselves into a frenzy over a rush to independence. But before we compound the disaster of Brexit by doubling down on the uncertainty likely to be caused by another referendum, let us reflect.I wrote to you a couple of weeks ago about the mediocrity of the current crop of politicians in Scotland and across the UK. In the interim, things havenrsquot suddenly, dramatically improved.The track record of the Scottish Government in dealing with newly devolved powers is mediocre: infrastructure issues, under-estimates of staff required to administer devolved powers and budgetary black holes. Do we really believe theyrsquoll be any better when they are required to implement and administer the powers and services that independence will confer upon them Two wrongs do not make a right. To suggest a rush to independence, at a time when the whole of the UK is in a period of uncertainty, is plain wrong. It is wrong firstly, because the Scottish Government is not prepared for a complete break from the rest of the UK. But secondly, and more importantly, the majority of the populace still do not want to split.Supporters of independence are loud, vocal and visible. The silent majority see no need to publicly counter these ostentatious displays of faux-Scottishness. They will turn out again at the ballot box, to vote down a break from the Union, regardless of whether Boris Johnson becomes PM or of whether or not Brexit is delivered.JS Brennan, Glasgow G.If the SNP Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay, is listening, then why not reduce Scottish income tax levels and Land  Buildings Transaction Tax levels too and see that the lower the taxes, the higher the tax income received due to greater activity and productivity  The SNP might not be happy to admit this but the Tory tax policy of allowing people to keep more of what they earn is not a crime and the \"attainment gap\" would close naturally rather than articially. Alternatively we can just wait until  and the next Holyrood elections. What goes up, must come down .Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IF the people of Scotland wish to remain part of the UK and an integral part of Europe the population needs to vote Labour. I suggest that to make this palatable to voters currently aligned to other parties, the Labour Party and the trade union movement have an urgent requirement to replace an inept Jeremy Corbyn. People have little confidence in Mr Corbyn ndash perceived as another Michael Foot. Hopefully the same will be true of the Tory Party faithful and this will eventually thwart Boris Johnson. My own preference for Labour leader would be Emily Thornberry, and Rory Stewart for the Tories .Robert Gemmell, Port

concerns have been raised about Buchanan and St Ambrose High Schools in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, built on a former landfill site, after incidents of blue water coming from taps.Members of

strike action on , ,  and  June.The council has insisted the schools and the site are safe.Buchanan High was closed to pupils on Thursday.Gerard McLaughlin, head of education at North Lanarkshire Council, said: ldquoDespite the facts being presented about the water being safe at the school campus and evidence demonstrating that it has been since early December and as recently as April , and that public health has stated there is no evidence to support a link between blue water at the school or the site itself and any serious ill health, the NASUWT has decided to take industrial action at Buchanan High School.ldquoThis follows extensive dialogue between senior council officials and representatives of the NASUWT over the last  hours.ldquoWe understand the impact that this will have on pupils and parents at Buchanan High School as a direct consequence of this action.ldquoHaving assessed the potential impact, we have regrettably decided that Buchanan High School will be unable to receive pupils during the period of industrial action due to the specic medical needs of some of the pupils.ldquoNeither the school nor the council would ever take any risks with young peoplersquos safety.ldquoDespite our disappointment that the NASUWT has taken this decision, we will remain in dialogue with trade union officials over the coming days.:pound.m to make toxic loch safe for The Scottish Government last week set up an independent review to help address the fears of parents and teachers.Paul Cackette and Dr Margaret Hannah, who are leading the review, met the headteachers of both schools, as well as public health experts and other representatives from North Lanarkshire Council on Wednesday.They are making arrangements to meet parents next week.The review is tasked with looking at specic health and safety concerns raised at the shared site, as well as the history, construction and maintenance of the campus.It will examine health concerns, including possible exposure to unspecied chemicals in the water resulting from previous land use at the new school site, to seethese are linked to developing cancer.The probe is set to be completed ldquoas soon as practicable and ahead of the next school year.Speaking when the strike was announced a union spokeswoman said: ldquoWhilst the NASUWT is in dispute over the situation at the school we have taken the unprecedented step of removing our members from the school site because of the serious health and safety concerns.More than , people have signed a petition calling for an investigation and for staff and pupils to be tested for toxins.The site was used as a landfill from  to  and domestic refuse and waste materials from the former Gartsherrie Steelworks were deposited there.Tests at the campus foundhigher levels of copper in the water in some areas of the school, which can lead to discolouration.More than ,metres of copper piping has been replaced with plastic pipes across the site, opened in , which also includes Townhead Community Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"beef event one of the best yet","story":"Early morning rain failed to deter farmers from attending the Scottish Beef Association#s Scotland#s Beef Event  held last month on a leading Aberdeenshire beef farm.Around , people streamed into North Bethelnie Farm, near Oldmeldrum, on Thursday, May .Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, speaking at the opening ceremony“It was a very successful day and generally recognised as one of the best of the biennial beef events the SBA has organised over the years,” said SBA vice-chairman, David Barron, who chaired the organising committee.“The  trade stands reported good business and the extensive technical demonstration area was thronged throughout the day with farmers keen to pick up all the latest technology for the beef industry.”Mr Barron was full of praise for the host farmers, Robbie and Barbara Milne, and their son, James, who put on a great show.One of the highlights of the day was the tour of the  acre all-grass farm – with no fewer than  tractors and trailers at the ready to avoid queuing – which took visitors right to the top of the hill, where they were treated to an ice-cream from neighbouring farmers, Mackie’s, while enjoying magnicent views of the Aberdeenshire countryside looking up to Bennachie.Beef farmers – like all farmers and indeed the whole of industry – are facing an uncertain future as the debacle and stalemate of the Brexit negotiations continues.The only thing farmers can do is to make sure they are operating as efficiently and productively as possible so they are in a strong position to cope with whatever hits them in the future – in or out of Europe – and they had plenty of pointers at the Beef Event which more than lived up to its theme - Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

Fty ships went to the seabed.In later years, many were later brought to the surface again during one of the most remarkable salvage operations ever attempted.Those that remain – seven vessels in all # attract ers from worldwide and make Scapa Flow the premier wreck ing site in Europe.The programme begins on Saturday, June , and involves talks by experts, performances by the German Navy and Royal Navy musicians, underwater imagery, a theatre piece, the screening of a  documentary on the scuttling – and the chance to explore the seabed wrecks using the latest virtual reality technology.Descendant of those involved in the events are set to come to Orkney, and a special service of commemoration will take place over one of the wrecks and at the Lyness Naval Cemetery.Full details are available on the Orkney Islands Council website: www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S scapa--events-programme.htm and on the Scapa  Facebook page www.facebook scapa copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

The council has insisted the schools and the site are safe.Buchanan High was closed to pupils on Thursday.Gerard McLaughlin, head of education at North Lanarkshire Council, said: ldquoDespite the facts being presented about the water being safe at the school campus and evidence demonstrating that it has been since early December and as recently as April , and that public health has stated there is no evidence to support a link between blue water at the school or the site itself and any serious ill health, the NASUWT has decided to take industrial action at Buchanan High School.ldquoThis follows extensive dialogue between senior council officials and representatives of the NASUWT over the last  hours.ldquoWe understand the impact that this will have on pupils and parents at Buchanan High School as a direct consequence of this action.ldquoHaving assessed the potential impact, we have regrettably decided that Buchanan High School will be unable to receive pupils during the period of industrial action due to the specic medical needs of some of the pupils.ldquoNeither the school nor the council would ever take any risks with young peoplersquos safety.ldquoDespite our disappointment that the NASUWT has taken this decision, we will remain in dialogue with trade union officials over the coming days. The Scottish Government last week set up an independent review to help address the fears of parents and teachers.Paul Cackette and Dr Margaret Hannah, who are leading the review, met the headteachers of both schools, as well as public health experts and other representatives from North Lanarkshire Council on Wednesday.They are making arrangements to meet parents next week.The review is tasked with looking at specic health and safety concerns raised at the shared site, as well as the history, construction and maintenance of the campus.It will examine health concerns, including possible exposure to unspecied chemicals in the water resulting from previous land use at the new school site, to seethese are linked to developing cancer.The probe is set to be completed ldquoas soon as practicable and ahead of the next school year. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ldquoOur members are suffering deep stress and anxiety about their health and welfare due to the failure of their employer to take the necessary action to provide assurances about the safety of the site.ldquoWhile the independent review promised by the Scottish Government is a welcome development it still does not commit to a full comprehensive site survey which tests the water, air, soil and fabric of the building.ldquoTeachers are deeply anxious about whether there is any link between conditions at the School, including the blue water and a range of health issues among staff.ldquoThe site survey should be commissioned immediately and as the end of term is only a matter of days away, the schools closed to enable the work to begin and at least give teachers and indeed pupils and parents some respite from the daily anxiety of having to attend the school site. As the local authority has refused to act to protect teachers the NASUWT will.Jane Peckham, NASUWT national official for Scotland, added: ldquoWe thank those parents and other members of the school community who have shown support for the strike and who stand with the NASUWT in calling for immediate and robust action to address these issues and to make sure the health of staff and pupils at the campus is safeguarded and prioritised.More than , people have signed a petition calling for an investigation and for staff and pupils to be tested for toxins.The site was used as landfill from  to  and domestic refuse and waste materials from the former Gartsherrie Steelworks were deposited there.Tests at the campus foundhigher levels of copper in the water in some areas of the school, which can lead to discolouration.More than ,metres of copper piping has been replaced with plastic pipes across the site, opened in , which also includes Townhead Community Centre.copy -.

This means that by the time they are ready to e they are already in oxygen conservation mode, which helps them save as much oxygen as possible.“This discovery provides a new perspective on the ­capacity to control the body’s fundamental physiological responses.”Dr Kimberley Bennett, at the University of Abertay, said: “We used a medical imaging technique and showed that it works under very tough conditions. Using wearable NIRS technology has given us amazing insights into how seals manage oxygen while they are underwater.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"spfl must not hide truth about sectarianism in football leader comment","story":"The SPFL must allow a dossier on sectarianism in football to be publishedit is to show it is committed to eradicating #Scotland#s shame#.Sectarianism has rightly become known as “Scotland’s shame”. However, as almost everyone knows, it is more precisely described as Scottish football’s shame.Football is the arena in which this mindless prejudice is played out. It’s where the vile songs are sung and the abuse hurled. It’s where successive generations of Scottish children have learned to sneer at and despise people who otherwise might have become their friends. Some who take part appear to have persuaded themselves that it’s harmless fun, a bit of banter, a real-le pantomime where it’s all just a “joke”, however nasty. But for others, it becomes an irrational ‘reason’ for lasting hatred and serious violence. How much energy and passion, indeed how many lives have been wasted in such a ridiculous and thoroughly despicable way The Scottish Professional Football League and the Scottish Government have a dossier that may shed considerable light on the extent of sectarianism as it contains statistics covering two years of matches.: SPFL accused of ‘gagging’ Scottish Government on sectarianism at footballHowever, facing calls from MSPs to publish the figures, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf told Holyrood that he was unable to do so as they had been provided on the basis that this information was “confidential” and not to be published.He had, he said, asked the SPFL to make the document public both verbally and in writing and the league had agreed to discuss his suggestion at its next board meeting. Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesperson Liam McArthur urged Yousaf to “rip up” the agreement with the SPFL, adding it was “inconceivable” that the Government had agreed to be “effectively gagged” in this way.Having entered into an agreement, it may not be right for the Government to break it, but it is clear that the SPFL has a moral duty to allow the figures to be published.If it does not, the suspicion will linger that Scottish football is not really interested in driving out sectarianism from our national game even though they are ashamed of the information contained in this ‘secret dossier’. The football world likes to claim bigotry is a societal problem, not a football one, but football is part of Scottish society and must play its part. It is often said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. If we are to rid ourselves of this most pernicious disease, there should be no question of hiding the truth, however ugly, in the shadows.: Billy Connolly is right about Scottish sectarianism – leader comment©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reps and union leaders meet over upskirting","story":"NORTH Belfast political representatives have joined union officials in meeting two teachers who were the victims of ‘upskirting’ to discuss the need for legislation around the issue.The meeting, which took place at Stormont on Monday, comes after the conviction of, Timothy Boomer , who was recently convicted of five counts of outraging public decency in relation to videos he took as a pupil at a Co Fermanagh school in  and .In itself, the act of ‘upskirting’ is not a crime in the North of Ireland, and campaigners have long called for legislation on the issue, which was discussed at Monday’s meeting.Speaking to the North Belfast News, NASUWT official, Justin McCamphill, said:“We held the meeting to give the victims in that case to set out their experiences and to discuss why the current legislation is inadequate.“The women actually had to take a judicial review against the PPS before the case was prosecuted. It was prosecuted under counts of outraging public decency.“The problem with that law is that it doesn’t treat them as the victims – it treats the general public as the victims. The conviction only happened because it was proven to be a public place because there was more than two people present. If there were no other people there it wouldn’t be illegal at all.“We were there to argue for specic laws. There are similar laws in Scotland, England and Wales, but we want our own bespoke laws.”He added: “In the event that the assembly is up and running we will be going to the justice committee and asking them to make a recommendation to the Department of Justice to bring in legislation to address this.”Following the meeting, North Belfast People Before Profit Councillor, Fiona Ferguson stressed the importance of better legislation and culture change to deal with this kind of sexual crime.“These women were let down by their employer, the police and the legal system. At points they were essentially told ‘boys will be boys’ and even when a prosecution was made, it was under common law of ‘outraging public decency’, which means that in the eyes of the law, the public witnesses were the victims, not the teachers who were upskirted. “We need comprehensive legislation that deals with cases where images are taken deliberately and without consent, so that victims can have a reasonable expectation of justice. And we need a societal sht in how we view consent. It is not good enough that in  women feel unsafe in their workplaces.

Workers will now have to examine their own pay packets to see have they received any payment for time worked over and above their normal working hours.If not, they should take urgent legal advice as time limits are important, as generally claims need to be lodged within three months of the last payment which was received for holiday pay which did not account for any overtime worked.Employers in both the public and the private sector will have to re-examine their method of payments and, as directed by the Court of Appeal, where appropriate include a payment for overtime in holiday pay.As it has now been defined by the Court of Appeal that workers must be rewarded and recognised for the time worked over and above their contracted hours, the majority of employers, both in the public and private sectors, will now be facing some form of a bill for unpaid overtime.How much will depend on inidual circumstances.Julie Leonard is an employment partner at Edwards  Co Solicitors, Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"parents of girl at centre of hyponatraemia inquiry to take stand at hearing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The original death certicate gave her cause of death as cerebral oedemaand status epilepticus, but this was called into question by a UTV documentary.Yesterday a world-renowned brain expert who made headlines at shaken baby syndrome court trials appeared at the fourth day of this weeks fresh inquest in Belfasts Laganside Courthouse.Noted neuropathologist Dr Waney Squier told Coroner Joe McCrisken there was no signicant evidence of encephalitis, a rare but serious illness that causes inflammation of the brain.Her findings mirrored those of another expert, Professor Brian Harding, who said the previous day that there is insufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of encephalitis in this case. The Hyponatraemia Inquiry, headed by Sir John OHara QC, ruled in  that Claires death had been preventable and ordered a new inquest, which started on Monday. Sir John ruled that medical professionals were involved in a cover-up following the tragedy.Hyponatraemia occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream and can happen due to receiving excess fluid.Dr Squier appeared via video-link as an expert in cases where babies had died as a result of suspected abusive head trauma or shaken baby syndrome.She was unable to offer a definitive diagnosis of encephalitis and said the \"minimal\" inflammation of Claires brain could have been a reaction to the child \"having been on a ventilator for some time\". Dr Squier was struck off the medical register in  in relation to six babies about whom she had provided reports and given evidence.She appealed the decision, and while it was found she committed serious professional misconduct, she was not dishonest. On Monday consultant microbiologist Professor Keith Cartwright said he no longer agreed that viral encephalitis played a role in the death - his original opinion given at the inquiry.Dr Brian Herron, one of the pathologists who contributed to the original autopsy report, has insisted pathological evidence showed \"mild inflammation\" had been present in the brain. Medical experts have so far indicated that cerebral oedema was the cause of Claires death, but they have dfering medical opinions as to what triggered it.Mr McCrisken is due to deliver his findings tomorrow.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership candidates do not have serious grasp of irish border issue","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They say there will be no hard border and they all say they don’t want a hard border, and no one wants the infrastructure again.“But under the backstop, we would have access to UK market and to the EU market.“One of my biggest concerns in Derry is that dissident republicans will make political capital out of the fact the Republic will have to put up some sort of infrastructurethere is a no-deal.”Keeping the Irish border open and free-flowing has been the most contentious issue to shape the Brexit debate, and Westminster’s failure to raty the Withdrawal Agreement has caused huge concern in border towns and villages.Front-runner Mr Johnson said earlier this week that the controversial Irish backstop problems could be solved by having checks away from the border.He was criticised after saying that the “fundamental flaw” in the Withdrawal Agreement is the Irish backstop, adding that he is not pessimistic about the consequences of a no-deal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Border Communities Against Brexit holding protests on Old Belfast Road Toni Forrester, chief executive of Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and cross border worker, said that a no-deal would be the “worst possible” scenario for border businesses.Ms Forrester travels from her home in Derry and crosses the border to her work in Co Donegal five days a week.“As a border population, we don’t believe there are any upsides to a no-deal. There’s been no clarity from the UK government as to how they will handle goods and services,” she said.“A no-deal will mean checks and anything that holds up trade just because of where they are is unfair to the region.“We would feel there is not a great depth of understanding from politicians in the UK about the border.“We don’t have any control over who is the next UK prime minister, but we would be urging all the parties to get a deal that recognises the border and the Good Friday Agreement.“The peace in Northern Ireland was hard fought for.”Oyster farmer Ciaran Gallagher has been working in the Lough Foyle waters for around four years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ciaran Gallagher and Maureen Nolan work on their oyster farm, close to Quigley’s Point on Lough Foyle He has , bags of oysters and is hoping to expand the business to , bags over the next three years.“There’s potential to make a really great business out of it,” he said.“We send most of our product to France, and while Brexit hasn’t effected us yet, when it does we hope it has a positive impact.“The British people need a second referendum as I think the majority of them didn’t know what they were voting for.”Brian McGrath, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said the Conservative leadership debate “did little to reassure” its members that the candidates had a serious grasp of the Irish border issue.“Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, with other key local stakeholders, have been involved in a positive discussion with the Alternative Arrangements Working Group,” he said.“This is no doubt a genuine attempt to resolve what seems to be an intractable issue, through the application of a technology-based approach to cross border trade.“We seem to be in a catch- situation. There must be Withdrawal Agreement before moving to an implementation period, so the idea that a solution can be found without extending the st October deadline appears very optimistic.“We remain open to innovative solutions, but we must ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"health staff strike deferred to allow fresh talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That assures a conviction, although it is not yet clear when a verdict and sentence will be handed down.Meng, who was elected president of the international police organisation in , was taken into custody after travelling to China from France at the end of September. Interpol was forced to ask China about Meng’s whereabouts.The Tianjin court said Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice minister of public security and maritime police chief, to curry favour for others infor bribes.Admitting guilt and expressing regret can result in slightly lighter punishment, although China has been quick to hand out le sentences as it cracks down on corruption and political disloyalty under a campaign run directly by the president and head of the ruling Communist Party, Xi Jinping.Shown on television, Meng appeared older and greyer than during his time as one of the nation’s top law enforcement officers. He has already been sacked from his positions and kicked out of the Communist Party.While serving at Interpol, Meng retained his title as a vice minister of public security.There are suspicions he had fallen out of political favour with Mr Xi, who has come down hard on corruption and perceived disloyalty in what observers say is a calculated move to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority.Meng’s we, Grace, has remained in France, where Meng was stationed for Lyon-based Interpol, and has accused Chinese authorities of creating a “fake case” against him for political reasons."},{"url":null,"title":"chinese president arrives in north korea for talks with kim jong un","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

It will be attended by roads and Phoenix representatives to discuss the planned work.A Phoenix spokeswoman said that as part of its investment to bring the benefits of natural gas to  towns across East Down, the company will be working across the Castlewellan area in the coming weeks.ldquoWe have communicated with impacted residents and traders who have been invited to find out more about the upcoming works at a public information event tonight, she explained.ldquoWe are aware of upcoming festivities taking place across the town and continue to review the most appropriate ways to mitigate against unnecessary disruption.The spokeswoman added: ldquoIn scheduling these works, we have liaised with relevant statutory authorities and agencies to ensure a co-ordinated approach to works taking place across the wider East Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New plan to revamp retail core unveiled  ","story":"SPECIALIST consultants are to be appointed to take a critical look at future retail development opportunities across the districtrsquos main towns.The move mdash sanctioned by local politicians and which could cost up to pound, mdash is part of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos development plan which will map out future residential, retail, commercial and industrial development over the next  years.Traders in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch are among those in seven towns across the district who will be asked for their views as part of the comprehensive study which will gather evidence to help guide future planning policies and assess the need for additional retail and leisure floorspace.Signicantly, local planners say that existing masterplan proposals for Downpatrick and Ballynahinch are now out-of-date, as is a plan for the future of Newcastle which formed part of the South East Coast masterplan.Planners say a fresh look at the future of the local towns is required as the previous plans do not provide a ldquoreliableevidence base upon which to develop a new retail and commercial leisure strategy for the district.Councillors were told this week that the production of a new retail and commercial leisure study has the potential to bring wider benefits by underpinning future masterplan proposals and formulation of economic development policies.The vitality of viability of town centres will also be examined as part of the new study with existing town boundaries also coming under the microscope.Consultants will also examinecurrent retail and leisure offering satisfies customer demand and the potential for new development sites.Agreement to press ahead with the survey, which will also look at hotel, restaurant and bar provision, came at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.The specialist retail consultants will support the ongoing work of the team behind the districtrsquos new local development plan with the proposed study expected to start before the end of the summer.The town centre assessments will focus on catchment areas, available expenditure and future development pressures.Strategic planning policy requires local authorities to undertake assessments of the need or capacity for retail and other town centre uses, with the former Department of the Environment previously advising isional planners on retail impact issues in their respective areas.When responsibility for planning was devolved from Belfast to local councils, no specialist staff from the planning retail team transferred to Newry, Mourne and Down.Councillors were told this week that itrsquos not considered there is the expertise within the local authorityrsquos planning department to undertake a ldquorobust retail and leisure needs and capacity survey in the district, prompting the needs to appoint specialist consultants.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran, the vice-chairman of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, has welcomed the new review.He is particularly pleased that the business community across the districtrsquos three main towns will be asked for its views.Cllr Curran said it was ldquocritically important that their opinions are factored into the future development of their respective towns to help secure new investment and attract more shoppers, boosting the districtrsquos economy.ldquoAn overarching survey of the districtrsquos retail and leisure needs is vital moving forward and the local authority should be congratulated on this approach, he said.ldquoA series of workshops are planned to provide traders with an opportunity have an input into the process and these must not be squandered.ldquoThe survey will take a critical look at what we have and what we need in the short, medium and long term future. Elected representatives will be asked for their views but, in my opinion, it is those in the business community which carry the most weight.Cllr Curran also welcomed confirmation that hotels, restaurants and other forms of leisure provision including local pubs will feature in the survey.He added: ldquoI am looking forward to the survey getting underway and will be very interested to see the final result.ldquoTraders in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Newcastle are being given a  to have their say and must play a meaningful part in the forthcoming

outline business case designed to pave the way for a poundm tourism bonanza in Newcastle.It has been confirmed this week that local council officials are progressing the business case for a series of highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9983442.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South

It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed. It feels very appropriate, given my fatherrsquos very high standards and professionalism that The Moorwell is being designed and constructed with the same values. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The council has insisted the schools and the site are safe.Buchanan High was closed to pupils on Thursday.Gerard McLaughlin, head of education at North Lanarkshire Council, said: ldquoDespite the facts being presented about the water being safe at the school campus and evidence demonstrating that it has been since early December and as recently as April , and that public health has stated there is no evidence to support a link between blue water at the school or the site itself and any serious ill health, the NASUWT has decided to take industrial action at Buchanan High School.ldquoThis follows extensive dialogue between senior council officials and representatives of the NASUWT over the last  hours.ldquoWe understand the impact that this will have on pupils and parents at Buchanan High School as a direct consequence of this action.ldquoHaving assessed the potential impact, we have regrettably decided that Buchanan High School will be unable to receive pupils during the period of industrial action due to the specic medical needs of some of the pupils.ldquoNeither the school nor the council would ever take any risks with young peoplersquos safety.ldquoDespite our disappointment that the NASUWT has taken this decision, we will remain in dialogue with trade union officials over the coming days. The Scottish Government last week set up an independent review to help address the fears of parents and teachers.Paul Cackette and Dr Margaret Hannah, who are leading the review, met the headteachers of both schools, as well as public health experts and other representatives from North Lanarkshire Council on Wednesday.They are making arrangements to meet parents next week.The review is tasked with looking at specic health and safety concerns raised at the shared site, as well as the history, construction and maintenance of the campus.It will examine health concerns, including possible exposure to unspecied chemicals in the water resulting from previous land use at the new school site, to seethese are linked to developing cancer.The probe is set to be completed ldquoas soon as practicable and ahead of the next school year. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ldquoOur members are suffering deep stress and anxiety about their health and welfare due to the failure of their employer to take the necessary action to provide assurances about the safety of the site.ldquoWhile the independent review promised by the Scottish Government is a welcome development it still does not commit to a full comprehensive site survey which tests the water, air, soil and fabric of the building.ldquoTeachers are deeply anxious about whether there is any link between conditions at the School, including the blue water and a range of health issues among staff.ldquoThe site survey should be commissioned immediately and as the end of term is only a matter of days away, the schools closed to enable the work to begin and at least give teachers and indeed pupils and parents some respite from the daily anxiety of having to attend the school site. As the local authority has refused to act to protect teachers the NASUWT will.Jane Peckham, NASUWT national official for Scotland, added: ldquoWe thank those parents and other members of the school community who have shown support for the strike and who stand with the NASUWT in calling for immediate and robust action to address these issues and to make sure the health of staff and pupils at the campus is safeguarded and prioritised.More than , people have signed a petition calling for an investigation and for staff and pupils to be tested for toxins.The site was used as landfill from  to  and domestic refuse and waste materials from the former Gartsherrie Steelworks were deposited there.Tests at the campus foundhigher levels of copper in the water in some areas of the school, which can lead to discolouration.More than ,metres of copper piping has been replaced with plastic pipes across the site, opened in , which also includes Townhead Community Centre..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Teachers strike at  ublue water u school article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

any plans to close local offices.The NIHE admitted it is looking at the way customers access services. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that in south region specically, we are looking at a number of options which include phased relocation and reduced hours given there are five offices within a short geographical distance of each other. But no decision has yet been taken.”Mr O’Dowd said: “I have been made aware that the Housing Executive is intending to a close a number of district housing offices including, Banbridge, Lurgan, and Portadown offices. Staff are being transferred to Marlborough House in Craigavon and other regional offices.“I am very concerned about the implications of this news for Executive tenants. They are losing a much valued local service and contact with Executive staff.“I am calling on the Housing Executive to carry out a full Equality Impact assessment and rural needs assessment before any final decisions are made about the future of the local offices.“The Housing Executive are a vital part of community infrastructure and should not be disappearing from local areas.“I have written to the Chief Executive of the Housing body to express concern and to request an urgent update on the future of local district offices.” A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “The Housing Executive is currently looking at how to best deliver its service and we are committed to maintaining services in local areas in line with customer demand.“Any proposals would be subject to a formal process to include consultation with union, staff, customers, the local community and political representatives. It will also assess the impact on equality and rural areas.“We would like to reassure customers that any decision taken by the Housing Executive will not affect the high quality service we deliver to them. We have also reassured our staff that there will not be job losses as a result of any changes to how we deliver services locally.”The spokesperson added: “The way in which our customers access services is rapidly changing. “We have seen a % reduction in footfall into our offices in the last four years, and a marked increase in telephone and online contact and we expect this trend to accelerate in the future.

develop our online services for our tenants within the next year and have already extended our phone service operating hours. “We have also changed the way in which we deliver services to our tenants and those who are seeking social housing by increasing the number of front line officer and having them call directly to customers’ homes rather than them having to visit our offices. “We are, of course, mindful that our customers are requiring our assistance now more than ever, and that is why we offer services online, on the phone and face to face across Northern Ireland. “We want to be able to respond to the needs of our customers and provide the services they require, while at the same time ensuring value for money and effective use of our offices.“Currently, we have offices in buildings which we either own or which we rent from private or public sector landlords. “We would prefer to spend money on services than unnecessarily on buildings. “If we have any proposals to alter

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
