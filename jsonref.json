Photograph: iStockIt is the largest study abroad programme of its type in the world. In fact, it has been so successful that the term “Erasmus” is now the internationally understood shorthand for those who study abroad no matter what the funding background.Since it was established 35 years ago, millions of students across Europe have left the comfort zone of their home institution to spend study or traineeship visits in another European country, among them tens of thousands of students from Ireland.For the first time in the history of the Erasmus programme, the Irish Government is to dip into the national purse to provide financial support for students seeking to study and work abroad. A surge in demand has left the Erasmus+ national agency at the Higher Education Authority (HEA) seriously short of funds.A co-fund of €7 million is being made available by Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris in two tranches – €3.5 million in 2022 and €3.5 million in 2023 – to help bridge the shortfall. The Government also anticipates that freeing up more places in Ireland will enable the sector to admit more fellow Europeans who would normally have gone to the United Kingdom.This welcome intervention has been made necessary by a massive 66 per cent increase in demand for places on the programme under the 2021-22 call. The HEA’s Erasmus+ national agency, which manages the higher education element of the programme received applications for more than 8,700 study and work abroad periods from the participating higher education institutions compared to 5,500 for the 2020-21 year.But a huge problem resulted when the European Commission was not in a position to provide the promised additional funding at the start of the latest iteration of the programme, which covers the period 2021-27.The national agency has had its budget for the 2021-22 academic year slashed by €3 million (a 25 per cent cut) down to €9 million compared to €12 million for 2020-21. This dip will be recovered from 2023 when EU funds will rise appreciably.Without the Government funds, the agency would only be able to support about 3,200 student mobilities and 250 staff visits. Thanks to the additional €3.5 million, another 1,500 iniduals can be assisted in 2022 and a similar number in 2023.The commitment does not extend beyond 2023. By then, the Government expects the extra funds from the European Commission will kick in. Applications always exceed actual realised mobilities with the highest outward-bound number to date being recorded in 2019 at 3,995. A realisation of 4,700 mobilities by summer 2022 will be a national record.The challenge is mainly felt by the eight Irish University Association universities plus Munster Technological University who account for some 87 per cent of total outbound numbers.Those with the largest growth are University of Limerick (+364), NUI Galway (+326), Trinity College Dublin (+264), University College Dublin (+261), Dublin City University (+170) and TU Dublin (+100).Driving the numbersComing off the back of a very travel unfriendly Covid landscape, the rise in demand is somewhat surprising. A significant feature driving the numbers is the fact that 1,500 mobilities are for students who must spend mandatory spells of one or two semesters of their degree programmes abroad.Other reasons posited are the greater flexibilities offered under the new programme, which, subject to certain conditions, permit study abroad periods of as short as five to 30 days compared to the traditional minimum two months studywork stays.Another very positive development has been the decision by the European Commission to provide mandatory supplementary social inclusion support of €250 per month.The net result of this is that a Susi (Student Universal Support Ireland) student will be able to receive roughly €550 for a study visit (up from €480) and €670 for a traineeshipwork placement (compared to €500 per month, maximum). The Erasmus+ national agency voluntarily introduced top-up social inclusion support in 2014 and was heading for a 20 per cent participation rate from Susi recipients before the pandemic struck.The Covid-19 pandemic has badly disrupted the student “experience” over the last two years. Remote learning and close campuses took their toll. With savings from the pandemic unemployment payment in the bank, students may have a bit more disposable income in their pockets to recover some of that lost learning by embarking on a studywork period in another EUEEA country."},{"url":null,"title":"eu ombudsman criticises antediluvian regulation on public access to documents","story":"European Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly has criticised a European regulation governing the right to access to documents held by EU institutions as “antediluvian” given the way that technology and social media have changed the world of communications.Speaking after her annual report was discussed by members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Emily O’Reilly said administrations needed to catch-up with the fact that there has been “a transformation in how we communicate in recent years”.Regulation 1049, which governs the fundamental right of citizens and residents of the European Union to have access to documents held by the EU institutions, has not been revised in 20 years. “That was before Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, and so on. The act is positively antediluvian at this stage given the transformation that’s happened,” Ms O’Reilly told the .The report included criticism of the European Commission for how it handled a request from a journalist for access to text messages exchanged between commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the chief executive of Pfizer regarding the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.“Increasing amounts of what were previously formal communications can now be done informally through text messages and WhatsApp,” she said. “The 1049 Act says documents include electronic documents, and from that we take the view that commission calls and text messages are included in that.”OpportunityHer office’s inquiry into the commission’s failure to disclose details of WhatsApp contacts in response to the request was “an opportunity to deal with that,” she said. Ms O’Reilly said “the Irish experience was interesting” in relation to the controversy over Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney deleting text messages relating to Katherine Zappone’s mooted appointment as an envoy to the UN. Since then, she has been in touch with the Irish Information Commissioner to “look at what they have been doing” regarding digital communications. “Our issue with the EU was that they needed to go back and check if the text messages exist, and then examine them against Regulation 1049 to see if they might be published if they deal with significant business issues,” she said. Ms O’Reilly said there had been “a reluctance to change” the regulation and that it has been “stuck for many years.” “But I think this really illuminates the problem. So perhaps this case will help to focus minds on that,” she said.On the topic of transparency, Ms O’Reilly said it “would be useful” for every EU member state to conduct an investigation into its handling of the pandemic. Taoiseach Michael Martin said in January that there would be an inquiry held into how the the crisis was dealt with in the State. Ms O’Reilly said she had discussed the prospect of public inquiries with her colleagues across Europe and noted former Swedish ombudsman Mats Melin’s work as chair of a Covid-19 inquiry in Sweden, which found serious failings in care in nursing homes.Big tech investigationsSeparately, Ms O’Reilly said she was expecting a reply from the commission about its failure to act against the Irish State over the pace of big tech investigations by May 15th. The EU Ombudsman opened an inquiry into the matter recently on foot of a complaint from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL). “We’re looking to see why the commission says there is no issue with the Irish data protection rules. They are saying they don’t think there is a problem at this stage, whereas others are saying there is a problem,” she said in reference to the ICCL’s complaint.The rights’ body has claimed that 98 per cent of significant complaints about privacy infringements remain unsolved, a claim disputed by the commission.“We’re looking at it from a citizens’ viewpoint and we’re asking the Commission to tell us why they say that,” she said.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsGarda Commissioner Drew Harris has done “an exemplary job” and is “rightly held in high esteem by the public”, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, has said, following the Cabinet’s decision to extend his term of office.The former Police Service of Northern Ireland deputy chief constable and RUC officer, who was sworn into the State’s most senior policing role in 2018, was due to stand down next September.However, the Cabinet approved the Minister’s request on Tuesday that he be allowed to remain in office until June 2025, under the current statutory retirement age for gardaí, at the age of 60.‘Best possible policing’Saying he was “delighted”, Mr Harris said it was “a great privilege and honour to be Garda Commissioner”, but he emphasised that more needed to be done to advance the “great progress” made to develop a “human-rights-focused policing and security service”.Blaming the pandemic for putting “on hold” some reforms, he said, “I look forward to leading An Garda Síochána in providing the best possible policing and security service to the people of Ireland. ”Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors general secretary Antoinette Cunningham said the Cabinet’s decision to extend the commissioner’s term of office was both “prudent and proactive”.“We are emerging from two years of significant disruption due to the pandemic, but similarly major disruption to the Garda organisation’s transformation plans,” she said, “There is much work to do.”‘Controversial in the past’Sinn Féin’s justice spokesman Martin Kenny said Mr Harris’s past career in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the PSNI has been “controversial in the past”, especially his testimony to the Smithwick tribunal.“But having said that, in my dealings with him, I found him to be co-operative and positive, whether on public issues with the gardaí or internal Garda issues. So I don’t have an issue with him staying on. “He had a lot of challenges, in bringing a sense of balance and restoring trust among the public. Trust in the gardaí, to a lot of members of the public, has been breached. He has a job of work to do around that,” said Mr Kenny.Citing the penalty points and 999 calls controversies, Mr Kenny said that major reforms of An Garda Síochána were still needed: “Many people feel there is a shadow of a culture still there.

Photograph: iStockThe planning regulator is to block attempts by Dublin City Council to introduce a number of tight controls on the development of build-to-rent (BTR) apartment blocks in the city.Deputy regulator Anne Marie O’Connor has told the council not to go ahead with measures to stop developers from building blocks with no homes for sale, and to omit from the city development plan restrictions on numbers of studio and one-bed apartments included in a scheme.The draft development plan would require BTR schemes of more than 100 homes to have at least 40 per cent of properties available for sale. BTR schemes of fewer than 100 homes would generally not be permitted, as they would not have a “critical mass” to support good communal facilities.The plan also restricts studio and one-bed apartments to a maximum of 30 per cent of a development, a provision which would apply in particular to areas such as north inner city and Liberties, which already have a high proportion of smaller apartments.City planner John O’Hara last month said the policy changes were an attempt to return a “ersity” of housing types to the city. “Build-to-rent has only emerged in the last three years, but it has largely displaced build-to sell altogether,” he said.Ms O’Connor said while it appeared the policies were “a response to the City Council’s observed trend of nearly all recent planning applications for apartment development being BTR schemes,” they were in breach of national policies and ministerial guidelines.Specifying 40 per cent of apartments had to be available for sale would mean those units would have to comply with higher standards than build to rent schemes. Similarly, she said there was “no national or regional policy basis, or any other evidence provided, to support the view that a scheme of less than 100 units cannot provide meaningful communal facilities and services”.In relation to the curbs on the numbers of smaller apartments she said this would also conflict with Ministerial guidelines on BTR schemes which stated there should be “no restrictions on dwelling mix”.She told the council it was required to omit or amend the policies which were inconsistent with the ministerial guidelines. However she said the regulator “understands and acknowledges the context for the proposal of these policies by the planning authority in terms of failing to secure a reasonable mix of housing in an area or the potential of an undue concentration of BTR developments that may be presenting in particular parts of its area”.The council’s proposed policy that applications for BTR would be accompanied by an assessment of other permitted BTR developments within 3km to demonstrate there would not be an over-concentration of one housing tenure was “a reasonable requirement” she said and provided a “strong policy basis that would empower the City Council” to address the over-concentration issue.Overall she said the regulator “endorses the majority of the housing policies” in the city plan.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord every little helps but mary lou reckons it s not helping enough","story":"Big supermarkets like Tesco did very well out of the Covid-19 crisis, said People Before ProfitSolidarity TD Mick Barry. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergThe Government went down the Tesco route to the tune of more than half a billion last week with its list of measures aimed at taking the sting out of the rising cost of living for people struggling to make ends meet.Every little helps and all that. More about Tesco later: the supermarket giant figured in Dáil dispatches on Tuesday, but not in a good way.Back to the Taoiseach, who outlined the highlights for the benefit of the Sinn Féin leader, as if she isn’t disgusted enough with what passes for Government largesse in these inflationary days.On top of what is due in this year’s budget, the recently introduced extras include a €200 credit on electricity bills, an additional lump sum payment on the fuel allowance, a 20 per cent reduction in bus fares and a lowering of the threshold for the drugs payment scheme. And don’t get Micheál Martin started on the money being poured into building houses.Not only did Mary Lou McDonald dismiss these efforts as “the bare minimum” which won’t make a dent in people’s problems, she also accused him of “dither and delay”. It’s no good asking hard-pressed taxpayers to wait until the next budget for more substantial cuts and supports.“Because the house is on fire now, Taoiseach.”This could badly burn Micheál’s bottom line. If the houses go up in flames it would do untold damage to his touchstone principle of “supply, supply, supply”. No wonder Darragh O’Brien, his Minister for Housing, blanched.The situation is bad enough as it is.Mary Lou came armed with the results of a flash survey she carried out at the weekend after putting a call out on social media for people to “share” their cost-of-living stories with her.“And in a matter of hours I received almost 1,000 replies.”May God bless their keyboards.SurprisedMary Lou sounded slightly surprised. Sinn Féin must have been delighted with the response to her Saturday afternoon appeal.“Stories of hardship and worry pushing families to the edge. So Taoiseach, I want to share some of these with you.”She mentioned Kieran, Barbara, Amy, Janice, Robert, Eamon and Caoimhe, all of whom got in touch to say how difficult it is to keep going while struggling to pay rent and bills as the cost of living rises.“And finally, Anna”, who is facing an ESB bill for €400. McDonald read Anna’s comment into the Dáil record: “The Government credit isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on. What about the cost of my petrol and my rent?”And speaking of the Dáil record, a few minutes later Labour leader Alan Kelly scored a not-insignificant first in the history of parliamentary intercourse when he managed to get the word “batsh*t” into the chamber chronicles. He was quoting a HSE official’s opinion of a plan to recruit 10,000 people.The Ceann Comhairle did not rebuke him because the word is not on the list of banned words as contained in “Salient Rulings of the Chair”. Now we know that “batsh*t” is not classed as unparliamentary language, maybe Mary Lou will be able to employ it against the Taoiseach in their daily jousts, if only for variety’s sake.Micheál Martin reminded her that Ireland and Europe have not escaped the global surge in inflation. Sinn Féin might say that last week’s €500,000-plus package is too small, but by suggesting billions more should be spent, “what you’re proposing is inflationary and would actually make things worse”.Micheál tried to find something good amid all the worry. “We have to acknowledge that this economy has rebounded,” he said to Mary Lou. “I’m not sure you acknowledge that.”It’s nice to see he’s keeping his sense of humour.But she was more keen to acknowledge that he hasn’t a clue.“Families are staring into the abyss . . . You cannot spin the truths of people’s lives.”Big moneyDo something that “takes costs down”, she urged. Ditch the carbon tax. Bring down the cost of childcare and rent so people are not paying big money to live in “kips, quite frankly”.The Taoiseach accepted that many are suffering due to the rise in inflation.“Well, then, do something about it,” riposted Mary Lou.That’s the different between the Government and Sinn Féin, he shot back. “We are doing something about it . . . Not just sounding off about it.”As the session went on, he tried to get some recognition for the post-pandemic economic growth and strong employment figures. But that was never going to happen.The new package of measures is a “paltry” offering, declared Richard Boyd Barrett of Solidarity-People Before Profit, finding it hard to understand how the Taoiseach could keep a straight face when talking about them.Labour’s Aodhán Ó Ríordáin described the package as little more than “a sticking-plaster”.The consensus from across the floor was that the Coalition is not doing enough to control the spiralling cost of living. Give the workers a break, pleaded Boyd Barrett. Why is it always possible to “loot their pockets?” he asked. “But it’s never possible to put a bit of extra tax on those who can well afford it.”Boyd Barrett, along with his colleagues Paul Murphy and Mick Barry, wanted a break for at least 100 security guards employed by Tesco, telling the Dáil that having worked through the pandemic they have now been told that their jobs are to be outsourced and if they don’t accept the move they face redundancy.Barry read a letter from one security guard, Keith from Mayo, which began: “I have been spat at, threatened and beaten up for this company over the last 16 years. Then on Tuesday, on my day off, the company called me to tell me my job is gone. It’s upsetting and disrespectful and we all deserve so much better.“How do I look my family in the eye when the mortgage company comes to take our home because Tesco took my livelihood away?”‘Heroes’Barry said: “Workers like Keith were the heroes of the pandemic.” He added that big supermarkets like Tesco did very well out of the crisis.“Tesco made more than £1 billion from stores in the Republic of Ireland and the UK in the 2020-21 financial year.”In a similar vein, RBB mentioned Aer Lingus, “a company that got a helluva lot of public money during Covid”, which is forcing its ground operation workers to vote on a pay freeze until 2025 and, in some cases, to take a 10 per cent permanent pay cut on their restored duty allowances.He said the company went into the pandemic with cash reserves of €900 million, and that its cargo business made a profit during that period when most commercial flights were grounded.The Taoiseach noted that the Government “did intervene and give assistance” to the company during the crisis.“I would say to Aer Lingus they should respect their staff, many of whom have given long service . . . And the same applies to Tesco.”Helps Tesco, that is, as opposed to the heroes of their pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"d%C3%A1il hears waiting list plan to come before government shortly","story":"The Minister said before the Covid-19 pandemic waiting lists were far too high and remain so. File photograph: GettyMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said he will bring the 2022 waiting-list plan to Government “very shortly”. Mr Donnelly said waiting lists are one of the biggest challenges facing the health service and it is a “top priority” for Government. He was responding to Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane in the Dáil on Tuesday, who asked what the Minister’s strategy was to “once and for all tackle the dangerously high wait times that we have”. Mr Cullinane said the latest figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund last weekend showed almost 900,000 people were on some form of waiting list. “We’re not going in the right direction, we’re going in the wrong direction,” he said. In response, Mr Donnelly said before the Covid-19 pandemic waiting lists across the board were far too high, are still too high and significant action is required. He said the waiting-list plan would be brought to Government shortly and builds on the plan for the last quarter of 2021, which resulted in a 6 per cent reduction in the waiting lists last year. Mr Donnelly said the plan would include revised waiting-list management protocols, improved data collection and information and more work on improving “patient pathways of care”. Kerry CamhsSeparately, the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People Mary Butler said the consultant psychiatrist post in south Kerry Camhs (Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services) is “unfortunately still vacant”. Ms Butler said the HSE does not expect to have a permanent consultant in the short term and has put extra support into the team there.“A dedicated consultant lead is in place and additional support is provided by other consultants,” she said. “Online consultant appointments have been offered. In the long term the HSE will establish a clinical support team in Killarney, and this will take a little bit of time, to provide a point of contact and support in the future.” Ms Butler said the HSE will be in direct contact with the young people and families shortly with details of that clinical support team. A recent report from the HSE said hundreds of children received “risky” treatment from a doctor working in mental health in south Kerry and significant harm was caused to 46 of them.A review examined the treatment of more than 1,300 young people who attended the south Kerry Camhs over a four-year period.The risks involved in the treatment by the doctor included sleepiness, dulled feelings, slowed thinking and serious weight gain and distress, according to the review."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden right covid along","story":"To understand Sweden, you need to understand a word that’s hard to explain, let alone translate: lagom. It means, in effect, “perfect-simple”: not too much, not too little. People who are lagom don’t stand out or make a fuss: they blend right in – and this is seen as a virtue. Essays are written about why lagom sums up a certain Swedish mindset – that it’s bad to stand out, to consider yourself better or be an outlier. That’s why it’s so strange that, during the lockdowns, Sweden became the world’s defiant outlier.Swedes saw it the other way around. They were keeping calm and carrying on: lockdown was an extreme, draconian, untested experiment. Lock up everyone, keep children out of school, suspend civil liberties, send police after people walking their dogs – and call this “caution”? Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, never spoke about a Swedish “experiment”. He said all along he could not recommend a public health intervention that had never been proven.Tegnell also made another point: that he didn’t claim to be right. It would take years, he’d argue, to see who had jumped the right way. His calculation was that, on a whole-society basis, the collateral damage of lockdowns would outweigh what good they do. But you’d only know if this was so after a few years. You’d have to look at cancer diagnosis, hospital waiting lists, educational damage and, yes, count the Covid dead. Almost two years on, we can look at the early indications.The problem with lockdowns is that no one looks at whole-society pictures. Professor Neil Ferguson’s team from Imperial College London admitted this, once, as a breezy aside. “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression,” they wrote in a supposed assessment of lockdown, “which will be high.” But just how high? And were they a price worth paying?As Sweden abolishes all domestic Covid restrictions, it emerges with one of Europe’s lower Covid death tolls: the rate is 1,614 per million people, just over half the amount of Britain (2,335). Given that our death tolls were comparable at first (both among the worst anywhere), it’s hard to argue that there’s some demographic force which meant Covid was never going to spread in Sweden. Nor is it possible to argue that Sweden was some hedonistic party-nation: its people were incredibly cautious. But unlike Brits, they had a government that trusted them.There were some Swedish diktats: a “rule of eight” was set up for a while. Bars, restaurants and cafes were all socially distanced and, at one point, had to close by 8.30pm. For a few weeks, Swedes even had vaccine passports. But that was about it: the rest was guidance, and it was followed.What no statistic can convey is just how careful Swedes were something that struck me whenever I’d visit. It was perfectly legal to meet up in bars and for a fika in a coffee shop, but most didn’t. A friend of mine had a rule that she’d only ever meet friends outside – even in the Stockholm winter (she did this so much that she got frostbite). In summer last year, studies showed Swedes working from home more than in any other European country.This kept Covid low, while the lack of rules allowed for people to use their judgement while minimising economic and social damage. Sweden’s GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 2020, while Britain’s collapsed by 9.4 per cent. Both have bounded back, but Sweden’s economy is this year expected to be five per cent larger than before the pandemic, versus two per cent for Germany. The UK will be about one per cent, one of the lowest figures in Europe. The cost of the various Covid measures is best summed up by the debt mountain: an extra £8,400 per head in Britain, and £3,000 in Sweden.Swedish schools kept going throughout, with no face masks. Sixth-formers and undergraduates switched to home learning, but the rest of Swedish children went to school as normal. That’s not to say there weren’t absences as the virus spread: it was common to see a third, at times even half of the class absent due to sniffles or suspected Covid. But there were no full-scale closures and, aside from some suspicions about minor grade inflation (the average maths grade sneaked up to 10.1, from 9.3), there is no talk in Sweden about educational devastation.In Britain, there is calamity and cover-up. By doling out more A grades than ever before – and telling universities to make more space – young people could be shovelled through the system with lost ground never recognised or quite made up.Grade inflation was staggering: the number of A-level students marked at A or A* jumped to 45 per cent, up from 26 per cent pre-pandemic, but no one doubts that these students learned far less. By some measures, educational inequality has been set back 10 years. But some problems are too big to admit.Academics suggest the effect of lost education is permanent: less education inevitably means lower salaries and slower career progression. The Institute for Fiscal Studies talks about £40,000 of lost lifetime earnings per pupil in Britain, £350 billion in all. Swedish studies estimate that Covid’s impact (on absenteeism and home-learning) could mean an £800 million overall hit – far smaller than the impact on Britain’s lost school days.The impact on hospital waiting lists is also very different. Fear of a virus keeps people away – at the peak of the first wave, attendance at Swedish A\u0026ampE was 31 per cent lower than normal in Britain, it collapsed by 57 per cent. Routine operations were down by 20 per cent in Sweden and 34 per cent in England, so waiting lists grew in both countries. As they did pretty much world over.But no country, anywhere, has had a waiting list grow as big as Britain’s: from 4.4 million pre-pandemic, it will keep getting worse for two years and peak at about 9.2 million, according to NHS modelling – that’s equivalent to one in five adults. A top-down health service is more easily disrupted if it’s ordered to transform into a Covid service (and people are told to “protect the NHS” by not using it). Sweden’s waiting lists, 130,000 pre-pandemic, hit 170,000 last October. Even adjusting for population, it’s nowhere near the size of Britain’s problem.Sweden will not declare victory. No one was properly prepared for Covid, and The country’s failure to protect care home residents is still seen as a national scandal. Sweden also took a bigger hit than its neighbours: Denmark, which did lock down, has more to shout about when it comes to combining a lower Covid hit with minimal economic disruption. But, as Tegnell would say, it’s still too early to say – with any finality – who got it right and who didn’t.More from NewsNicola Sturgeon’s strict Covid rules did not keep Scotland’s deaths below England’sQueen to help pay for £12m Prince Andrew settlementWho is Virginia Giuffre?

And quite a lot of people inside the organisation must have agreed – given the innumerable committee meetings that it would have passed through to gain approval.Having seen the overwhelming triumph of the campaign to protect the NHS by presenting it as a national institution that belongs to all of us, the Corporation has now launched an embarrassingly desperate public relations onslaught with precisely the same theme.It is, believe it or not, “your BBC” – even when it righteously screens out what it regards as your unacceptable views, or imposes its particular version of social virtue on the nation, or refuses to apologise for what you may see as an offensive anti-Semitic slur.The clumsily worded slogan – “The BBC is something that belongs to all of us” (something? what exactly?) – is apparently to become a ubiquitous refrain in its endless self-promotion, but if you want the full length version, you can view a video on iPlayer entitled This is our BBC.This opus is obviously designed to be hilarious, proffering the subtext “we don’t really take ourselves too seriously” when, in fact, what it reveals is that the BBC sees itself as a sacrosanct mainstay of British identity.Whatever you may have been tempted to conclude, it insists, we are not an out-of-touch, self-regarding purveyor of our own particular worldview which regards much public opinion as beneath contempt.Listen to what we are saying now about how we view ourselves and, above all, be aware that we cannot carry out this mission without your participation.That somebody – indeed, lots of people – within the organisation felt that this absurd exercise was appropriate tells you something about the state of mind at Broadcasting House.The Corporation has reacted to the threat to its future and its antiquated funding model in precisely the wrong way. Instead of listening with a semblance of respect to the criticisms made of its attitude and judgment, it has become more arrogant and aggressive.In its news and current affairs programming, it has become more insular and enclosed. What passes for discussion on the news consists of a BBC presenter interviewing a BBC correspondent who repeats a pre-scripted version of what the presenter has just provided.Instead of opening itself up to genuine arguments or to alternative opinions that are enlivening public discourse in the real world, it shuts down any possibility of disagreement. The result is predictable, anodyne and anti-democratic.In much of what should be apolitical programming – entertainment and lifestyle genres – it inserts themes and directives which clearly have a political intent and treats any public resistance to this as a form of heresy.Who do they think they are fooling?

Half of complaints were about poor delivery, including customers not receiving their documents back having submitted them to the agency.The breakdown in customer service comes after workers at the Welsh office went on strike, owing to a dispute over Covid safety measures. This, combined with the safety measures, added a backlog of more than 400,000 paper licence applications last year. The DVLA also had to send scores of staff on paid leave or instruct them to work from home last year after a Covid outbreak at its offices.Its website has a statement telling motorists it was sorry for any inconvenience and staff were working hard to reduce waiting times. The website added: There may be additional delays in processing more complex cases, for example, if medical investigations are needed as part of your driving licence application.Martyn James, head of media at Resolver, said disgruntled drivers had contacted the site to complain that their vital identification documents were being held hostage.“Lots of people have found themselves stranded without permission to drive, despite having obtained medical proof that they are able to get behind the wheel”, he said.Almost all of the complaints relate to simply not being able to speak to someone at the DVLA or get help or information about their application.This is having a significant impact on their lives.The DVLA said demand was currently extremely high on its phone lines and that there were currently long waiting times to get through.Drivers have taken to social media to voice their complaints. One Twitter user who called himself Alan Brown said that his 82-year-old father could no longer drive after waiting so long for a response that his licence had expired. My dad is deaf and lives alone. He needs his car, he wrote.He has sent his licence back for renewal, filled out his medical form, sent it back and still had no response from DVLA. His licence is now showing expired. He is extremely worried.Another Twitter user said they had been unable to travel abroad after sending their passport to the agency: I applied for my provisional licence back in August last year and I still haven’t received it.I sent off my passport with it, meaning I haven’t been able to travel abroad. I also haven’t been contacted in regards to why this is taking so long.A DVLA spokesperson said: “We handle millions of transactions every year and there are no delays with our online services, which have been working as normal throughout the pandemic and we encourage customers to use these where possible.“We are working extremely hard to reduce waiting times for paper applications and have recruited more staff, increased overtime working and secured extra office space to help reduce waiting times for customers.

Almost daily, I hear from my constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne quite how seriously they are feeling the pinch. Their pay packets are just not stretching far enough. These people range from care workers to young city types, from nurses to supermarket staff, and they all tell me that while they work harder than ever, they are struggling more to make ends meet. We know Brits have needed a pay rise for a very long time, after a decade of wage stagnation and the rise of new insecure forms of work people are left struggling. I know that is not good enough for the families in Ashton-under-Lyne, or families anywhere in Britain.Trade Unions exist to collectively empower workers - and it is that goal that took the Labour Party to Parliament. The Labour Party’s links with the Trade Unions aren’t just historic, they are more relevant than ever in these precarious times for British workers and their families.When people need decent pay to keep afloat, flexibility to manage their family le, and the confidence to challenge inequality, Trade Unions are more important than ever. I know that working families are the backbone of our economic growth. A wasted decade of low growth in our economy under the Conservatives has unsurprisingly come alongside a decade of stagnant pay. They have chosen to become the party of high taxes because they are the party of low growth.I also know that despite the barriers the Conservatives have put in the way, good employers and businesses already work closely with Trade Unions because they care about their workers. When I was a Trade Union representative, we only saw victories because businesses understood they needed happy and healthy staff. But those workplaces where people are overworked, unable to switch off, or are paid poverty wages cannot be left unchecked. It is when we come together that we are strongest and achieve the most. Security at work, prosperity in decent pay, and all workers treated with respect. That is Labouraposs New Deal for Working People and the driving mission of the Labour movement.

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives.

Boris Johnson will chair an emergency COBR meeting today after he cut short a UK tour to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The Prime Minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Monday night, when both leaders agreed there was a crucial window for diplomacy but the threat of Russian aggression remained serious.More than , Russian troops are massed on the Ukrainian borders. But some units started toto their bases on Tuesday morning, offering a glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution.  Ms Truss said Europe was teetering on the brink of war and time was running out to find a diplomatic solution. And she said the crisis could embolden other countries with military ambitions. The senior Tory told Sky News: If we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict, we could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe and could see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too. This is a very dangerous moment for the world. Ms Truss said the stability of Europe was hanging in the balance. The big risk, of course, isthere is an invasion into Ukraine that will be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine. And it will further undermine the stability of Europe, she said. This, I fear, would not stop at Ukraine. This is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine legitimacy of them being part of NATO.  She said she was very worried about the situation, adding: We could be on the brink of a war in Europe, which would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russia and Ukraine, but also for the broader security of Europe. There is still time for Vladimir Putin to step away from the brink. But there is only a limited amount of time for him to do that. Mr Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have agreed to continue down the path of negotiations, prompting hopes that there could still be a way to avert war. A Downing Street source said there was some hope that diplomacy could work and Russia could step back.

He is good with other dogs and people. He hasnapost been cat tested.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.“Doru would love a home with a garden and can live with another dog for company.” He has been described as an “amazingly trusting and affectionate”, who has lots of energy and loves his walks. However, he can get nervous when walking in unfamiliar settings and would need to stay close to his owner on a lead. Doru’s foster family said: “He is not bothered by house noises and ignores cats, squirrels and ducks in the park. “He is quite quiet. He is very quick to learn and now sits and waits on command and has stopped snatching treats. He is gentle and playful with other dogs. “Doru has been known to jump on tables and kitchen surfaces still and is very ‘hungry’.  “He is clean in the house mostly but still needs monitoring.

Many of the dogs in their care have been victims of abuse, neglect, disease or trauma - and struggle to survive in shelters. A Blind Dog Rescue UK statement reads: “It is incredibly dficult for sighted dogs to survive anyof time in these shelters let alone blind or partially sighted dogs. “We need to get to these dogs quickly and secure their immediate release and treatment. “These dogs may have been deliberately blinded, involved in road traffic accidents or long term sufferers of painful conditions such as glaucoma. “They need veterinary care and to be given the safety and comfort of a foster home in which to start healing. “Here they are given love and affection and a warm bed - possibly the first they will have experienced in their letimes.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Dave Clark, , says his interest was sparked by a childhood visit to a local tip. The handyman, nicknamed ‘Dustbin Daveapos by friends, collects photographs of his favourites. The dad-of-two has now launched a quest to uncover Britain’s best dustbin. He said: “I’m after the totally unique ones. If it’s unusual then I’ll take a picture.“If you see a fun bin it makes you smile as you walk past. “The perfect outdoor bin has a big opening and is medium size - you don’t want it massive. “It needs to be nice and colourful with a wacky design. “I’m looking for something that stands out. Nice and bright colours. “But at the end of the day you can’t beat a classic council bin.”Dave was seven years old when his dad took him to visit a rubbish dump for the first time. He was so inspired by the “Aladdin’s Cave” of interesting junk that he began wearing a yellow bobble hat and pretending to be a binman. Dave explained: “I was fascinated by how they picked up the bins.” Despite his childhood dream Dave has ended up working as a self-employed gardener and window cleaner. He has photographed dozens of his favourite bins across the UK, which he rates according to size, location and design. His current favourite is a “fascinating” seaside bin styled as a Fab ice cream lolly in Thrigby, Norfolk. Dave said: “The Fab bin is still my number one. “It’s like your first girlfriend - it’s the one you never forget. “I saw the Fab lolly design four years ago and thought ‘wow, look at that bin, it’s so colourful.’ “I wish there were more bins like that.”  Dave lives in Caister, Norfolk, with his we and two kids, who are understanding of his unlikely hobby.He is a member of the Commercial Bin Fan Club on Facebook where he shares his passion with other enthusiasts.Dave said: “If you take the time to look you would be amazed by how many dferent types of bins you can get. “It’s about promoting bin awareness and making people take more notice and put their rubbish away.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ice creamPeopleIn the news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But a Manchester University study has shown it’s a ­relatively small group of patients who have been piling on additional pressure at surgeries. These “frequent attenders” account for a large proportion of a GP’s ­workload – % of appointments, including ­face-to-face consultations. The findings go some way to explain why it’s so hard to see a GP. Frequent attenders – classed as people having more appointments than % of patients at their practice, have more than doubled their number of clinic visits in the last two decades. The study ran from - and looked at million consultations from .million patients in  ­GP practices. It showed four out of  patients were frequent attenders. Co-author Dr Maria Panagioti, from Manchester University, said: “Frequent attenders also may have special health and social care needs but for a iety of reasons we do not yet fully ­understand how best to meet them.”Consultations with GPs by frequent attenders increased from an average of  in  to  in . But when consultations with other staff at GP clinics, such as nurses, were added in, the average figure more than doubled from  to . To cope with more requests for appointments GPs are using a iety of means, including non-face-to-face, such as telephone and online. It seems the traditional way of patients seeing GPs is being replaced by a new working model where other staff members are using dferent ways simply to cope with workloads. Co-author Professor Evan ­Kontopantelis from Manchester University, said: “This is the first study to show that frequent attenders, the top % of consulters, have largely and progressively contributed to increased workload in general ­practices across the UK over the last  years.” Co-author Professor Aneez Esmail, also from Manchester University, said: “Our findings show frequent attenders account for an increasing proportion of face-to-face consultations with GPs and are responsible for nearly % of consultations fairly constantly over time.” Dr Panagioti added: “But these ­findings may also suggest the increase in multi-disciplinary staff working in general practices is perhaps the only solution for sustaining primary care. “Indeed, the large increase in the general practice workload over the last  years means having extended multidisciplinary teams is necessary to meet a wide range of patient needs through a range of ways such as remote consultations.” Sounds like general practice will never be the same.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February. Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged  Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. Will I have to pay for a PCRI am vulnerable  It is believed that PCR tests will remain free for those listed as vulnerable, as well as those in hospitals and in high-risk settings. Sources toldthat this will also include the . million eligible for antiviralsthey contract Covid. The government will outline the full details in the upcoming plan, but say there are no intentions to completely scrap community testing. A spokesperson added: Everyone can continue to get free tests and we are continuing to encourage people to use rapid tests when they need them. Record numbers of tests are being delivered to pharmacies, homes and those who need them. Testing continues to play an important role in helping people live their day to day lives, keep businesses running and keep young people in school.

Daughter Lilibet has never visited the country after being born in Calornia.And now according to biographer Tom Bower, who is writing a book about Meghan, she has no intention toto the UK and doesnapost careshe is welcome in London. Writing in the Sun, he said: At the moment, Meghan’s ultimate destination is unclear, but she certainly has the backing to make a bid to star as an American politician.In parallel, Britain is a lost cause for the Sussexes. In truth, I suspect Meghan no longer cares whether she is welcome in London. She has no intention of ing. However, he does point out that while public opinion about Meghan in the UK might not be favourable - in the US she is still admired.

In a statement from his lawyers, he claims the lack of continuity means he and his family are unable tohome. It was announced last year that Bower was writing a book about Meghan that he says will tell the truth.He is one of the countryaposs most well-known biographers, having released in-depth unauthorised le stories of famous figures like Richard Branson and Boris Johnson.Bower also isnapost a stranger to writing about royal figures as he released Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles in . A source previously told the Sun : This is the book Meghan will be dreading.Tom doesnapost pull his punches and is terryingly thorough in his research. No stone will be left unturned.The announcement of his book about Meghan came just shortly after Harry revealed he would be releasing a tell-all memoir about his le next year.The memoir is set to be the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and le lessons that have helped shape him, according to publisher Penguin Random House.

On a clip posted by Matthew Larino there is a message the reads: So apparentlyyou shine a light on your licence some type of anima l will show through...Then a licence is shown held up to a light, showing the shape of a fish, made up of light shining through tiny holes in the card. The video shows a stunned Matthew saying “Get outta town,” before running to get his own drivers licence.  Once he holds his card up to the light, sure enough, you can see the dotted shape of a bear shining through the plastic. The comments exploded with others finding their own secret animals. Yes I had to try it. Connecticut, wrote one commenter, including their licence with a picture of a whale made out of tiny perforations. A buffalo!!! In Oklahoma! said another excited viewer.  “Mine has a turtle, this is the happiest I’ve been in weeks,” said another excited comment. But not all licences have animals, some show a symbol representing that state, or a national tree or flower and some even have an outline of the state itself. Several include the stateaposs national tree or flower, or just a symbol representing the state. For example, Nebraska licences have a cornhusk, while New Mexico features the Zia sun symbol.According to theNational Notary,these distinct images are used as a security feature and are made during the production of the IDs.The site also noted that: These images are usually representative of the issuing jurisdiction.

In the video, which has been widely shared on social media, the gang of “ to ” kids and teenagers can be seen kicking and punching the girls as they lie on the ground screaming. A woman who witnessed the attack, by students from the Bishop Young Church of England Academy in Leeds, begged them to stop their assaut, shouting “leave her alone”.The gang of youths then turned on the bystander who said she ended up with some of the kids “on her” after she tried to intervene in the incident which took place near Arthur’s Rein Park in Leeds.The witness said the ambush involved over  students attacking the girls, who were reportedly thrown into a lake during the assault, Leeds Live reports. The witness described what she saw saying: “They were attacking her and another. I shouted ‘leave her alone’ and ‘what on earth are you doing ’ “I just saw around  to  kids coming towards me but I wasn’t bothered about me, just the young girls. I ended up with some of the kids on me.” She added that it didn’t last long. It has been reported that the girls were thrown in the lake during the assault and Bishop Young Academy has now issued a statement to parents about “poor behaviour happening on the way to or from school.”  The letter signed off by the headteacher Rachael Cole states: “Unfortunately, over the past few days, there have been some of incidents of poor behaviour happening on the way to and from school, and in the evening within our community. Although these incidents involve a very small minority of our students, they have had a negative impact on the local community and the reputation of our Academy. We are working very closely with parents, the police and the local community to address these issues and ensure that our students are responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to our society. “Please rest assured, that any time we receive information about the conduct of our students it is acted upon in the strictest possible terms, even when such behaviour occurs away from the academy. Should our students break the law, we actively encourage you to not only report it to us, but to also report it to the police and we will continue to work with the police to safeguard our students and our local community.” West Yorkshire Police have said they are making enquiries following the assault.They said: Police are making further enquiries following a report of an assault, which is said to have occurred in Dib Lane, Roundhay on  February. Anyone with information that will assist is asked to contact the East Leeds Neighbourhood Policing Team on , or by using the options on the West Yorkshire Police website.

Tiny Hannah is thought to be the smallest baby ever to survive in the UK and was given a  per cent chance of pulling through by doctors. Parents Ellie Paton, , and Brandon Stibbles, , are now finally able to hold the tot, who will stay in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, in Glasgow, until she is big and healthy enough to go home. The couple, from Newmilns, Ayrshire, were warned by medics ‘babies that small don’t survive’ - but Hannah was strong enough to breath by herself.They are counting down the days until Hannah can be transferred to Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, which is closer to home. Hannah now tips the scales at . ounces and her eyes have opened. Her delighted parents have been able to feed her through a tube - although one of her lungs has collapsed.  The couple are enjoying reading her stories and watching their baby respond as she now recognises their voices. Dad Brandon said: “We have both got to hold her a couple of times. “It’s a completely dferent feeling - you can either pick her up from the incubator or they can bring her over.  “We prefer that, she’s really really small. “Her eyes have opened and she’s pretty aware now. “She was waving at us, and we wave back.

Mum-of-three Kirsty Bortoft, from Scarborough, decided to make the move from Britain to a remote mountain in Spain, after years of suffering with severe anxiety and bad mental health. Kirsty was having regular panic attacks and said her mental health had been declining after a split from a “toxic” ex. So she decided to give up material possessions for the peace and quiet of the off-grid le. In , Kirsty was trying to juggle le as a single mum with three young children, a two and three-year-old, and a six-month-old toddler. Kirsty said: It was extremely hard breaking up with my partner, along with having next to no money.I went to the doctors and they were lovely, but theyaposre trained in drugs and pharmacology – a drug would numb it [my feelings] but I knew it wasnapost the answer. Then, after my appointment, I had this inner, small flickering of hope. In a moment akin to Eat Pray Love, the biography written by Elizabeth Gilbert,, Kirsty realised that she needed to find a new path. She was miserable in her office job and wanted to do something that would reignite her zest for le. The mum started by going on a free weekend course to become a le coach – which, in a roundabout way, would soon see her jet off on a journey to Spain. Kirsty said: During a class, I had this awakening where I realised that my le was like one big jigsaw puzzle but there was one piece missing. Iaposd been trying to aposfixapos myself on the outside for so long, when really, that one piece is where I need to fix myself on the inside. I needed to go on a massive, soul-searching journey.  Kirsty had become interested in mediation, and while researching her next step stumbled across the Ishayas Monks. The monks, who live in Reus in the Mont-Ral mountains, are dedicated to consciousness and aposmastery of the selfapos – the inward journey of aposletting goapos or surrender. Instead of GIlbertaposs Italy, India and Indonesia, the mum opted for a closer location – taking her children along for the ride. She said: I felt so drawn to what they were teaching to the point where I took my two youngest out of school and drove to Spain to study the working of the mind and the mastery of the self with a load of monks! It may sound like a crazy decision but my extended family were really supportive. Plus, it was great for my oldest kids, who were eight and  at the time, as there was a little school there and loads of opportunities for adventure. It sounds crazy but I wasnapost scared whatsoever.  Kirsty and her children shared a house with another family, and everyone followed a programme each day including sunrise yoga and meditation. There were three other families from the UK and Australia, and a school and pool for the children to learn and have fun. Kirsty said: Our children would be taught by monk teachers and go on incredible nature adventures while the adults learned their teachings. The house was beautul, fairly big and open and with incredible views over the mountain to the coast. The breakfast would be pretty normal with porridge and lunch would be salads, soups, cold soups, fruit and then dinners were more hearty. It was a very clean diet, so no alcohol, no rubbish and it was almost all organic. Kirsty remained with the monks for four years, in the end studying to become one herself.  She graduated as an Ishaya Monk in  and was christened as Rudra Devi – meaning The Goddess Who Removes Pain. Itaposs not about meditating  hours-a-day anymore, bald heads and big cloaks – itaposs a new modern way!” she said. Itaposs about bringing something back into the community and using it in real le and that was what really excited me about it. We were on top of mountains, surrounded by people who wanted to be more, still, present, loving, kind and helpful. It was the best experience. While in Spain, Kirsty had kept her house in the UK and once a fully-fledged monk, decided to head back home to share her wisdom with stressed-out Brits. Now a mindset coach too, she helps people suffering from anxiety and mental health-related issues using the techniques she learned while living with the Ishaya Monks. Moving back to England, I was so excited to tell everybody about it and teach but then I realised that not everyone was ready to hear it,” she said. I knew I needed to share what Iaposd learned with the world and after a while I started to get more and more clients, and now I work with people all over the UK. I believe and teach that we get so busy with stuff thataposs generally external to us such as what s, bills, work stress what-nots, that we get confused, worried, and donapost sleep because of them. Le is for thriving, not surviving, itaposs one short le and we need to find that part inside of us that really helps us through. Up until lockdowns happened due to Covid, Kirsty dedicated some time every summer to go back and visit the monks in Spain.

So he paid his entry fee and ordered a pint at the bar before mingling with other clubbers at the Emporium in Coalville, Leicester.The young ravers were so touched they posted a message on the nightclub’s Facebook page which went viral.Brian was invited back this week for the unveiling of a plaque marking the spot where he met Barbara all those years ago. Did you meet the love of your le somewhere interesting and have you revisited it  Email: features@mirror  He said he was determined to visit the club one last time following Barbara’s death two years ago. “She was the most wonderful person I’ve ever met, and I’m so proud that I was able to call her my we,” he said. “It [The Emporium] was known as ‘The Grand’ back then. I’d been in many times before, but I’d never seen anyone like Barbara. “She was standing on her own and she stood out a mile. She was gorgeous, so angelic. It was like a miracle really. “I was coming back from the bar and I looked up and saw her standing on the stairs in a long white dress, which had a red rose pinned to it. “I was out with the boys and I was wearing my leather jacket at the time.  “I said, ‘I have to go and ask her out, otherwise I’ll regret it for the rest of my le’. So that’s what I did. “I said ‘I wonderI could have this dance with you ’ She said ‘yes’ and then we introduced ourselves and we stuck together ever since.” The pair, who lived in Coalville, began dating and married two years later before having two sons. Recalling his recent visit to the club, Brian said: “I closed my eyes and I could see her as clear as anything. It was wonderful. “I stood on the top of the steps and so many memories came flooding back as well as plenty of tears.“The funny thing about Barbara is that she never liked to be the centre of attention – she didn’t like to stand out. However she always did,” A spokesman for the Emporium said: “I’ve heard of love stories before, but this broke my heart and made my night.” “He said he wanted to see the love of his le one more time and said when he closed his eyes, he did.” The plaque, which is located on the wall of the staircase, reads: “In loving memory of Barbara Timson, who met Brian Kendrick, .” Brian added: “To see her name up there, I’m so proud of it.

However, the organisation is often the subject of conspiracy theories developed by people who believe Freemasons secretly run the country or change the world for their own benefit. It is believed that the group conceals at least some of its rituals, customs, or activities from the public, but the most powerful Freemason in England and Wales is less of a secret.According to My London, the head of the lodge, who members refer to as the ‘Grand Master’, is none other than the Queen’s first cousin Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent.Having been appointed in June , Edward has been serving the lodge for almost  years, making him the longest-serving head.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up. Edward, , is the son of the Queen’s paternal uncle, Prince George. In other words, Edward’s father was the brother of Queen Elizabeth’s father King George VI. He became the Duke of Kent when he was just six years old after his father was killed in a plane crash in . He has been carrying out royal duties since the age of  - first by walking behind the coffin of his uncle King George in , and then by paying homage to the Queen on her coronation in . He has also been involved with over  charities, including the Freemasons, where much of his charity work revolves around war remembrance, technology, and the growth of British industry.Although Edward is the head of the United Grand Lodge of England, he is not the head of all Freemasons worldwide. There are around  million Freemasons around the world – , of them living in England and Wales. The Duke’s brother, Prince Michael of Kent, is also a Freemason and is Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons, and Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Middlesex. Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh was also a Freemason having been introduced to Freemasonry in  at the age of  by his Father-in-Law King George VI. Throughout his  years, he was associated with some  charities, either as president, patron or as an honorary member.The Prince supported charitable organisations in the fields of scientic and technological research and development, the encouragement of sport, the welfare of young people, conservation and the environment. Dr David Staples, chief executive of the United Grand Lodge of England , said: “Prince Philip was well known for his charity work, having been involved with numerous organisations. He was devoted to philanthropy and therefore the best way to celebrate his le is by supporting the charities that the Prince himself supported. “For us, this was an easy decision as Freemasonry’s core values are charity, integrity, respect and friendship. The Freemasons have been quietly getting on with making society and the lives of those less fortunate better for more than three centuries,” said Dr Staples.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, made the claim against Andrew for damages in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs friend, to have sex with the royal when she was , a minor under US law. Andrew denies the allegations against him. In a letter submitted to the United States District Court on Tuesday, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Andrewaposs lawyers to say that the parties had reached a settlement in principle. Court documents show the Duke will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Andrew has also pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Here, Royal author and former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond writes that Andrew is tarnished by his friendship with a convicted paedophile. And she notes how it will take more than a charity donation to clear his name... The cost to Prince Andrew of settling his long-running dispute over sexual abuse allegations will not be cheap. But the cost to his reputation is clear. Even though the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre is over, the road back to official royal status for the Duke of York remains barred forever. It is a cleverly worded statement. The announcement of an out of court settlement avoids any suggestion that Prince Andrew was personally involved in any wrongdoing. But it accepts that Virginia Giuffre is a victim of sexual abuse and trafficking at the hands of the man the Prince once regarded as a useful friend. Ms Giuffre has not won the public apology she was seeking, but neither has she withdrawn her allegations that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her on three occasions.  It is the Prince who has made the real concessions in this settlement, contritely stating that he never intended to malign the character of the woman he claims he has no recollection of meeting. His lawyers had been sharpening their knives and asserting that Ms Giuffre might suffer from memory lapses. They had raised the possibility of interviewing her husband and her psychologist about her mental health. But now the Prince acknowledges that she has suffered not only as a victim of abuse but as a result of unfair public attacks. Some might think that those attacks largely came from his own camp.  And, in a change of heart, the Prince now makes it clear that he does indeed regret his association with Jeffrey Epstein. In his car crash TV interview on Newsnight, he was asked directly by Emily Maitlis whether he regretted the friendship. “Still not,“ he replied, “and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.” Andrew has always been an opportunist. He has now been persuaded to take this opportunity to show his support for the fight against the evils of sex trafficking by making a hefty donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity. He has also been persuaded to commend her bravery in standing up for herself.  This settlement avoids the humiliation of the Prince being interviewed next month for up to seven hours under oath about intimate details of his sex le. It also puts an end to the sensational prospect of a Duke on trial in a civil court in the States…with all the attendant publicity and damage to the monarchy. There’s no doubt that he was under pressure from the Palace to bring this corrosive episode to an end. In this of all years, with the Queen celebrating the historic milestone of her Platinum Jubilee, no one wanted any more lurid headlines about sexual abuse. She has already felt obliged to humiliate her son by sacking him from royal duties and stripping him of his HRH title and military appointments. The prospect of seeing him take the stand in an American courtroom was unthinkable. The bluster of recent weeks, with the Prince saying he would fight as a private citizen to clear his name, was the usual grandstanding in civil cases. Virginia Giuffre was also said to be determined to have her day in court. In truth, the vast majority of these cases are settled out of court, and that was always the likely outcome. Is there any way back for Prince Andrew now that this has been agreed  Absolutely not. The Queen has already assured the smooth transition of the monarchy by expressing her wish for Camilla to be Queen alongside Prince Charles. And the new King will want a streamlined modern monarchy in which Andrew was already surplus to requirements.  He is, of course, a much-loved son and is adored by his ex-we, Fergie, and their two daughters. He will remain part of the royal family into which he was born, and I am sure the Queen will include him in family le. But there can be no public role for him ever again. The fact is that Prince Andrew will forever remain tarnished by more than a decade of speculation about his friendship with a convicted paedophile. As Ms Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, commented about the out of court settlement: “I believe this event speaks for itself”. And in the court of public opinion it will take more than a charity donation and some carefully chosen conciliatory words to comprehensively clear the Duke’s name.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenJennie BondPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesNewsnightRoyal FamilyCrimeCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A statement released this afternoon confirmed they have reached an agreement away from the courtroom, and Andrew will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity. Royal author Penny Junor believes his royal relatives will be extremely glad heaposs avoided a public trial in the US. She said: Going to trial, it could have been very, very nasty.  It could have been embarrassing, humiliating, and it would have been huge fodder for the tabloid press. It could have really taken the shine off the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee year. “At last, he’s expressing some regret and some empathy for those girls. She said his  Newsnight interview had been “all about him” but that Andrew has “got it right now”. She added: “He’s got it right now, it took him a long time to get there but I think he’s got it right.” Askedthere is a way back to public royal le for Andrew, Ms Juror said: “I think it’s very, very unlikely.” Earlier this year the Monarch stripped her son of his royal titles and took back all  of his military affiliations, including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. She faced mounting pressure to act with a letter signed by more than  Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking her to strip him of his military appointments.At the time, a source told The Mirror he was shell-shocked by the decision. Todayaposs statement, which was included in a letter submitted to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, who has been overseeing the civil sex claim brought by Ms Giuffre, said: “Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement. “The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre’s receipt of the settlement . Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights. “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. “It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenPenny JunorPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A US judge previously denied the Duke of Yorkaposs attempt to have Virginia Giuffreaposs lawsuit thrown out.Ms Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with Andrew three times when she was a apossex slaveapos of Andrewaposs paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein as a teenager. The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. In recent months his legal team tried numerous times to get the case thrown out, or to discredit Ms Giuffre, who they claimed was seeking another payday at his expense.  Ms Giuffreaposs legal representative said his client was determined to face the royal in court after judge Lewis Kaplan said her civil case could proceed. However Andrew and Ms Giuffre have now settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.Court documents published today reveal that Prince Andrew regrets his association with Jeffrey Epstein. They also reveal that Andrew plans to show his remorse by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. A document submitted to a US court said: Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement.  Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffreaposs character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years.Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. Ms Giuffre was pictured with the royal in an infamous photograph believed to have been taken in , when she was . Here we look at some of the attempts the Duke and his team made to prevent the court showdown from happening: . Claiming Virginia Giuffre may have  memoriesAs the Sunday Mirror reported, Andrew’s lawyers wanted to quiz Ms Giuffre’s psychologist to seehis accuser was ­suffering from “ memories” of meeting HIM.The move emerged in legal documents filed as part of the case. Andrew claimed he did not remember meeting her – despite the infamous photo of him with his arm around her. It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial.  But Andrew’s lawyers were determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers stated that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”. The move linked to the Duke of York’s stance in his  car crash Newsnight interview where he claimed to have “no recollection” of meeting Ms Giuffre.. Attempting to rely on secret deal made with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein One avenue Andrewaposs legal team used to try and get the case thrown out was a , settlement made between Ms Giuffre and his former pal Epstein. In a  deal which was unsealed earlier this year, the financier and sex offender agreed to pay Ms Giuffre after she accused him of sexual abuse. One key clause in the deal suggested that Ms Giuffre would be barred from taking action against any other parties linked to Epstein.  This, the Dukeaposs lawyers argued, would have included Andrew himself. The settlement included an agreement to remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia , including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. But Judge Kaplan was having none of it. Epstein, he said, was only out to protect himself, he ruled, and this aspect of the agreement did not prevent Ms Giuffre from pursuing a civil claim against Andrew. Judge Kaplan said that settlement was too ambiguous to protect the royal. . Arguing Ms Giuffre could not sue as she lived in Australia Another technicality which Andrewaposs team hoped could prevent the case continuing was the fact that Ms Giuffre no longer lives in the US. This, lawyers claimed, meant that she could not legally take action through a US court.  The Dukeaposs lawyer Andrew B Brettler, called for the case to be halted at the end of last month. He wrote: “Recently discovered evidence suggests that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this action because plaintf Virginia L Giuffre cannot satisfy the elements of ersity jurisdiction. “Notwithstanding that, in her complaint Ms Giuffre alleges she is a citizen of the state of Colorado the evidence demonstrates that she is actually domiciled in Australia, where she has lived for all but two of the past  years.” Again, this legal argument did not get very far. . aposHidingapos to prevent lawsuit being served on himBack when the civil case was launched, Andrew was accused of hiding to avoid the lawsuit being served on him.Security personnel repeatedly stopped officials trying to hand the Duke of York the documents at the Royal Lodge in August, it was claimed. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers said the papers had been handed to a Met Police officer at the Royal Lodge in Windsor on August . But they claimed the agent was told police told them they were not able to accept served court papers, or let anyone serve them on the property. It led to Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers seeking intervention from Judge Kaplan, claiming Prince Andrew was playing game of hide and seek behind palace walls.  . Claiming not have met Ms GiuffreDuring his car-crash BBC Panorama interview back in , Andrew claimed he had no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre.Rubbishing her allegations that she had been forced into having sex with him, Andrew said: I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady. None, whatsoever. He was pressed by interviewer Emily Maitlis, who asked him: You donapost remember meeting her  The Duke replied: No. Years earlier a photo had emerged of Andrew with his arms around Ms Giuffre with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. However his circle have long suggested it is a fake - alleging that his fingers were not chubby enough to be his in the image. A palace source said Andrew has “absolutely no recollection” of the photo being taken and “seriously doubts” it is genuine. “Look at his fingers,” they said. “The duke has chubby fingers, they don’t look right, nor does the height of the duke and the girl. His legal team have asked to have the original photo so they can carry out their own investigation. They seriously doubt its veracity. The duke is adamant and has been consistent since  that he does not recall ever meeting Miss Roberts, let alone the photo being taken.” “Many close to the duke, who know him well, believe this is a witch-hunt based on absolutely no evidence.” . Pizza Express alibi and claims he could not sweat  Two of the claims in Andrewaposs  Panorama interview that drew the most attention were his claim that he was at a Pizza Express restaurant on one of the nights he is claimed to have had sex with Ms Giuffre - and his claim he cannot sweat. Quizzed about Ms Giuffreaposs claim that the prince sweated heavily on the night in , Andrew claimed to have a medical condition that meant he could not sweat. In legal documents related to the civil case, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers David Boies and Sigrid McCawley called on the Duke to hand over all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat. His lawyers refused, however, on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Similarly the Duke did not present any evidence proving he was at Pizza Express on March ,  - the night Ms Giuffre claims he partied in a West End nightclub before having sex with her. His lawyers responded: “Defendant is unable to comply with Request No.  because no such documents exist in his possession, custody or control. A diligent search and a reasonable inquiry have been made in an effort to comply with this demand.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine has signalled a preparedness to sideline or abandon a desire to join Nato. Sustaining talks, however strained, is better than the alternative.

Voters deserve to know his excuses for attending boozy bashes when his Government was busy imposing draconian laws on ordinary people, punishing more than ,. If the PM claims he’s stupid, clueless, accident-prone, unfortunate or above the law, the nation has a right to see it in black and white.

Parking and cars are banned at any time in Sheerness, Kent, where the townaposs clock tower normally stands in an area impossible for traffic to access. Before it was pedestrianised, there were double yellow lines on the street that have gradually faded over time. Swale Council has defended the painting as refreshed, but has also conceded they are due to be removed anyway. Conservative Cllr Cameron Beart, who represents Queenborough and Halfway on Swale Council and Sheppey on Kent County Council, said they must be the most pointless double yellow lines ever. He added: They are an absolute eyesore and totally unnecessary in a pedestrianised part of the conservation area. They serve no purpose at all and should be removed.  Stephen Jackson, whose Jacksonwood Vintage Tea Rooms overlook that section of the High Street, was equally confused. He said: You could hardly see the old lines but thataposs not an excuse for repainting them, as they shouldnapost be there now. The old lines were probably there from before the benches were put in. Itaposs a complete waste of time. After carrying out the paint job, Swale Council confirmed the lines are now due to be removed.  A spokesperson said: The double yellow lines that were already at the clock tower were refreshed by our lining contractors who were working to repaint yellow lines in Broadway and the high street in Sheerness. We carry out regular lining and signage maintenance around Swale. These restrictions are now scheduled for removal. The clock tower is currently being renovated and is not expected tountil later this year.

Two low pressure systems were originally expected to bring spells of very strong winds and potentially snow between Wednesday and Saturday, but Brits could feel the impact of sooner than thought after forecasters moved forward the warning period.Storm Dudley, which carries a danger to le weather warning, will likely start and finish earlier than expected, according to the Met Office, ahead of Storm Eunice moving in, bringing strong winds and potentially some snow for parts of the country on Friday.Gusts of up to mph are set to batter the whole of the country due to a jet stream which was originally forecast to hit on Wednesday and Thursday under a yellow weather warning.  But this has now been upgraded to a more severe amber warning bringing le-threatening gales to parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England. Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said an active jet stream is driving low-pressure systems across the country, both of which are likely to cause some disruption.Winds are expected to be strongest on exposed coasts and hills of Scotland, with -mph possible further inland. This is applicable to southern and western Scotland, the north coast of Northern Ireland and northern England, where the strongest and most disruptive winds are expected.  Winds are expected to ease through Thursday afternoon and evening. The stormy conditions will barely have subsided before the next low pressure system, named Storm Eunice, will track across central areas of the UK. According to the Met Office, further impacts are expected from disruptive gale force winds - with - mph winds expected inland. Heavy rain is expected to come alongside the system as well and there is a potential for some signicant snowfall over hills in the Midlands and further north.National Highways Head of Road Safety Jeremy Phillips encouraged drivers to check the latest weather and travel conditions before setting off on journeys, and considertheir journey is necessary and can be delayed until conditions improve.“If you do intend to travel, then plan your journey and take extra care, allowing more time for your journey,” he said. “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down. “Drivers of other vehicles should be aware of sudden gusts of wind which can affect handling and braking, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans, and motorbikes plenty of space.

Ms Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts, made the claim against Andrew for damages in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs friend, to have sex with the royal when she was , a minor under US law. Andrew denies the allegations against him. In a letter submitted to the United States District Court on Tuesday, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Andrewaposs lawyers to say that the parties had reached a settlement in principle.  When asked for comment on the settlement, Mr Boies said: I believe this event speaks for itself. Court documents show the Duke will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Andrew has also pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. An attachment to the letter announcing the settlement gave brief details of the agreement between Andrew and Ms Giuffre but indicated the sum would not be disclosed.It read: Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement. The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffreaposs receipt of the settlement . Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffreaposs character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.  It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents eight victims of Jeffrey Epstein, welcomed the settlement as a victory for Virginia Giuffre.  She wrote on Twitter: My statement on behalf of the  Jeffrey Epstein victims I represent: aposWe hail Virginiaaposs victory today. She has accomplished what no one  could: getting Prince Andrew to stop his nonsense and side with sexual abuse victims. We salute Virginiaaposs stunning courage.apos In January, the dukeaposs lawyers submitted  reasons why the case against him should be dismissed, saying he demanded a trial by jury. Mr Boies, said his client and legal team were looking forward to confronting the royal about his denials. Representatives of the duke said they would not be commenting further than what was said in the documents submitted to the court.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Posting from her handle @mrsnicolekerr, Nicole explained that she sets a timer for  minutes a day and during that time she does as much decluttering or cleaning in one aposzoneapos or room as possible.The fly lady cleaning method consists of setting a timer for  minutes a day and doing as much decluttering or cleaning in one aposzoneapos or room as you can. In addition to that, the method also includes an hour of aposhome blessingapos which is time dedicated to bigger cleaning jobs, such as changing bedding, hoovering, taking the rubbish out or dusting.

One said that the full glass of Coors just fell off the table and it left him with goosebumps. Shocked Natasha, , was then left stunned when she watched it back on CCTV at the -year-old White Swan Inn, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. The pint appears to suddenly plummet onto the ground despite no one being near it. It is feared the pub has been targeted by ghouls before. But Natasha thinks a former regular Chris Harris, , may have come back to haunt them this time and is behind the moving beer to play tricks on them.  Natasha said: There was quite a large group of people and I said aposYou are making quite a mess, whataposs all this beer on the floor apos And one of the boys said that wasnapost me. I was like aposYeah alright then not believing themapos and they were like aposI promise you that it just fell now, look at my goose pimples.apos One of the staff persuaded Natasha to check the CCTV footage to seethe lads were telling the truth. The security camera footage, filmed on February , shows a full pint glass sitting on a table as nearby customers sat chatting in their seats. Suddenly the glass topples off the table, despite none of the punters touching it.  Natasha recorded the CCTV footage and can be heard pointing out the blurry hand of a spirit around the pint and the candle fluttering uncontrollably on the table. She said: Looks like a hand pushed the pint off, the pint goes a bit fuzzy. One of our regulars recently died so we thought it might actually be him. She has been working at the pub for the past  years and says there have been several unusual sightings by staff and customers. She added: I have been working for  years and really havenapost seen things like this, I have heard things. All of the staff have heard things about the things going on in the pub for so many years.  I felt things like there were people walking past me when there was nobody there. Last Sunday, I moved out of the way of a dog but there was no dog in the pub on that day. One time when I closed the pub I made sure to lock all the windows shut but when I left I noticed that something had opened one of the top windows without anyone  being in the pub. Staff have felt like somebody has been watching them. The cleaner saw somebody near the toilet door but seconds later there was nobody there. The activities of the spirit in the pub have increased in the past two weeks, according to Natasha, and she believes it could be due to a clairvoyant evening due to be held at the pub.

One person said: Oh my god, please tell me you didnapost pay for this. While another added: Oh no, girl, tell me you didnapost pay.  The womanaposs video has over . million views, and other commenters were quick to let her know that the design she picked out was never going to work on her nails because they are a dferent shape from the ones in her reference picture. Someone said: That design wonapost work on short nails, but the nail technician should have told you that.

The couple, who have been together for  years, had spent the night at a nearby spa on the island, off West Cork, before setting out on a romantic morning stroll along the clftop, CorkBeo reports.When they came across the beach, the woman was shocked to see the personalised message which read will you marry me my Mags Cleary  etched into the sand. Passersby were touched to see the heartwarming display of affection which also included a giant heart shape pierced by Cupidaposs arrow.  Mags, from North Cork, told CorkBeo: I certainly wasnapost expecting to see a proposal on the beach when we were out walking the next morning. I did get a bit of a shock. The couple, who are parents to Daryl, nine, and Robyn, seven, had been enjoying a rare romantic break. And Mags had been expecting some sort of development on the wedding front. She said: I thought something was up when we were going away, but I thought it might have been when we arrived at the hotel or over the meal that night.  Patrickaposs nephew helped formulate the romantic proposal by finding a local artist to sketch out the love message in the sand early in the morning at low tide. Mags said she appreciated the effort that went in to making it a very special Valentineaposs Day. She said: Weaposve been together  years so I suppose he had to do something dramatic. Heaposs certainly good with surprises. The engaged Mags told how her hubby-to-be got down on one knee but did not have the ring with him at the time. He knew there was no point as Iaposd probably want to pick out another one so we went into Killarney yesterday and got one, she added. The couple have not made and firm plans yet for the wedding but said it is a day that their children will certainly be looking forward to.

Images at °apos°N °apos°E, show what appears to be the hallowed ground where deconstructed buildings are now grey rubble. One internet sleuth made the connection after seeing the eerie image on Reddit. They wrote: It is indeed the Norillag labour camp. You can even see the mining facility connected to the camp further west. Good catch OP [original poster]!  Another person commented on a photo of a nearby street east of the Gulag. They wrote: Thataposs one of the most depressing places Iaposve ever seen. Norillag, the Norilsk Corrective Labour Camp, was a Russian labour camp where prisoners were made to build the complex and dig for copper and nickel. Workers were later forced into other activities such as fishing and even reconstructing the home where Joseph Stalin lived in exile.  The labour camp operated from June , , to August , . It is estimated more than , inmates worked there throughout its history. It is believed that , of them were political prisoners. Norillag began with just , inmates. However, as Stalin pushed to identy any nonconformists during the Great Purge, the number of inmates skyrocketed. Vladimir Lenin set up the forced labour camps before they reached their peak once Stalin took power in the early s.  It is thought there were more than , camps in the Gulag system and more than % of the Soviet population were imprisoned or in internal exile.

The North Korean dictator is said to have made the decision after he was told the aposKimjongiliaapos Begonias - a flower named after his late father Kim Jong-il - would not be ready in time for the former leaderaposs birthday.The flowers were meant to be a centrepiece for a huge celebration tomorrow - which is marked as the Day of the Shining Star. A man in his s from Samsu County, who has only been identied as Han, was reportedly managing the greenhouse growing the Kimilsungias and Kimjongilias.  He was sentenced to six months in a labour camp, according to reports. Kimjongilias, also known as the immortal flower, were created in  by Japanese botanist Kamo Mototeru to mark the former leaderaposs birthday. The flower has grown in signicance since the passing of the former North Korean leader in . Han was reportedly ordered to make sure the flowers would be ready in time for both the Day of the Sunand the Day of the Shining Star.  This would have required the temperature and humidity of the greenhouse to be monitored carefully. However, due to a reported lack of firewood, this wasnapost possible and they failed to bloom in time. The gardeners have allegedly been accused of neglecting the flowers.A source told Daily NK News: Economic activity greatly decreased due to the strengthening of the countryaposs emergency disease-control measures, which led many Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia greenhouses to become neglected. But now theyaposre suddenly saying that the Kimjongilia flowers have to be grown in time for the event, so how is Han supposed to grow them  The source went on: Other employees have been punished. A flower grower surnamed Kim [in her s] was called in every day to the county party committee to report on the state of the flowers and to write self-criticism reports. Another man only known as Choi was said to be in charge of the boilers and was allegedly sentenced to three months in the labour camps for not properly setting the temperature. It is not the first time there have been dficulties growing the flowers - and they have previously been imported from China as a result.

The increasedof the submarine allows Rubin’s engineers to include several more features, such as a reduced radar signature, improved stability, and better integration of weapon s. The submarine also has a sonar antenna and radar stations. The marine machine is designed to reach a maximum speed of  knots , according to preliminary data. This speed is achieved by integrating a more powerful power plant and reducing resistance to movement in the surface position.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges.CAPTION:If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.

with ious events already pencilled in.Mr McEwan stressed the importance of the annual event and said: “The festival is our gateway to the summer.“It is something that has been traditional since .“It is a chance for the town to see and do things together, a chance for businesses to take part just like the Christmas window competition, get people round the town, and it is a chance to showcase our town to the greater country and to invite people along.“When I did the car show, we had people from all over Scotland coming with cars. That brought in tourism, visitors, but at the end of the day, for me, it is giving families and the kids a good day out.”The week-long Haddington Festival is a central point of the town’s summer celebrations.Preparations are under way for the festival fun day in Neilson Park and a number of vendors have been approached.The Haddington Festival is usually one of the highlights of the towns events calendar A shop window competition, organised by Haddington Business Community Partnership , is also being planned.Regular features of the festival week, including a quiz night, bingo night and boat race, are all being planned as well.A tree could also be planted at the end of the festival to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee.One challenge facing organisers is the lack of a central venue, as refurbishment works take place at Haddington Town House and the nearby Corn Exchange is used by NHS Lothian as a Covid- vaccination centre.That could see the traditional pet show become an online event.Mr McEwan was hoping to overcome as many hurdles as possible to ensure that the town was celebrating this summer.He said: “We are hoping the fun day is going to be as traditional as possible, with a fun fair and car show.“It is all going to be dependent on who is going to come along.“I very much doubt we are going to have as many Covid restrictions to scupper us.“The programme will be delivered out to everybody in round about May.”"},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-praised-face-coronavirus-pandemic","story":"Various restrictions over the past near two years have made it challenging for pupils to continue learning in a traditional manner.Robert Flood, curriculum leader – social subjects at Knox Academy, attended a recent meeting of the towns community council.He said: “Everyone has worked really hard to try to keep things as normal as possible and as many activities happening in the school and extra-curricular activities as well.”"},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-birthplace-hosts-anna-davis-exhibition","story":"Anna Davis will see her work on display at John Muir’s Birthplace from February .‘Water-way Following the Papana Water to Belhaven Bay’ features paintings, drawings and writing.The artist, who is based in West Barns, has created a limited edition book that is a journey of impressions, writing and images from the Lammermuirs to Belhaven Bay.The book Water-way follows the journey of the Papana Water through East Lothian."},{"url":null,"title":"work-starts-new-east-linton-railway-station","story":"Network Rail was given permission for the station by East Lothian Council in September last year.When complete, it will be the first time the village has had a railway station since .Campaigners have been calling for a station tofor more than two decades. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotlands Railway is expanding. ⁰⁰🏗️ Work on a brand new station in East Linton, @ELCouncil has begun.

I’ve been to Bamburgh beach several times before and it always works. It always make you stop and look – at the castle, which is the finest on this coastline of castles, and at the long stretch of sand, spread flat and gold, butter on toast, and back along the coast towards the village of Seahouses where we’re staying, at the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Scots may be brought up to think their coastline is the most beautul in the British Isles, but I’m not so sure. I’ve defected.The Castle Inn is also the perfect place to see and enjoy this part of the coast. The hotel sits at the top of the harbour and the dog-friendly room we’re staying in has its own little private garden that starts with a comfy terrace and ends with a view of the fishing boats and the pier and the North Sea. Winter’s on the way so the sea is in a bit of a bad mood when we arrive, but it doesn’t matter. We retreat to the hotel’s restaurant and order pints of Doom Bar and plates piled high with chips.The next day is more castles and our choice this time is Dunstanburgh, a ridiculously dramatic ruin a few miles south of Bamburgh. One of the best ways to get there is to park at the village of Craster and walk along the coast and there it is: charcoaled across the horizon, dark, ruinous. It was built in  not as a fortress against the Scots, as you might expect in this part of England in the th century, but as a fortress against the wrong kind of English . We circle the battlements. The sheep pay us no mind.Then, having let the distant past crowd in, we travel inland to a dferent, more personal kind of history. Our destination is the village of Allendale. We park near the King’s Head pub and head down the hill and there it is, parked incongruously, mockingly even, at the bottom of a flight of steps. It’s a Dalek and it’s the doorman of the Museum of Classic Sci-Fi.Inside, we meet Neil Cole, the creator and curator of the museum. It’s an extraordinary and exciting place for someone like me – whose hero was, is, and always will be Tom Baker – but for Neil it’s even more personal.He remembers playing in the fields and moors of Northumberland when he was growing up in the s and his childish mind could turn rocky outcrops into landing sites for Sontaran spacecraft and the moorland into the Death Zone on Gallrey. This is where his imagination, sparked by a TV programme, came to play.And now, aged , his vivid imagination has turned the basement of his home in Allendale into a fascinating museum full of the original props and paintings and monsters that he’s collected over the years. There is the head of a killer mummy and the face of an alien gastropod and a complete example of a Zygon, the race of aliens who hid in an underground base in Scotland and controlled the Loch Ness Monster. Neil says the magic is in getting close to the things that matter to you and I see what he means. It’s a wonderful place that delights in the possibilities of imagination and the craftsmanship of the people who turn imagination into objects.There’s something similar going on in the shop we visit on the way back to the coast: Re, in Corbridge. This town was once the place where the Romans controlled the north of Englandbut it’s now an attractive market town full of quirky shops and Re is the best of them. It sells a mixture of new and antique home accessories and we wander through little corridors of plates and cups and jugs, and past shelves of primary-colour cushions and end up in a corner piled high with yellow and red and blue slabs of soap. My urge is to buy it all.And the shopping is not done for the day. We head for Alnwick and the beloved Barters book shop, said to be the biggest second-hand book store in Britain. Who knowsit is or not but I do know how wonderful it is. It’s housed in a former railway station and there’s a model train that runs round the room to remind you of its origins. I spend two hours browsing, stop for a baked potato in the café, then do another two hours. In the land of castles, this is a castle of books.Bags full of goodies, we head back to the Bamburgh Castle Inn. Some pub restaurants rise above the phrase “pub grub” and this is one of them. The homemade steak and stout pie is a rich, handsome thing but so is the Tex-Mex veggie burger andseafood’s your thing, some Scottish mussels have also made their way down here. It is all topped off, naturally, with a few more sips of Doom Bar. We take our pints out to the terrace. Down at the harbour, some fishermen are working on their boat. A man is walking his dog up from the beach. The gulls glide. But we are still. We’ve stopping moving again. And we’re happy.TRAVEL FACTSMark Smith was a guest stayed at The Bamburgh Castle Inn as a guest of The Inn Collection Group www.inncollectiongroup. Advance booking of bed and breakfast is available at The Bamburgh Castle Inn from £ a night in January and February, £ in March, £ in April, £ in May and £ in June, July and August.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?1644849796000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220214newscovid 19 mon 14th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.

Picture: Peter Morrison PA WireLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll Covid- legal restrictions in Northern Ireland will be replaced by guidance from Tuesday, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced.Among the Covid- restrictions being removed from law are the requirement to wear a face covering in public places and the use Covid certicates in nightclubs – although their use in all hospitality and entertainment will continue to be encouraged.Mr Swann also reiterated his position that there are currently no plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland.The decision to scrap Covid- laws follows consideration of legal advice from the Attorney General and consultation with Executive ministers and moves the pandemic response in Northern Ireland into a new phase.However, announcing the swathe of relaxations, the UUP minister also stressed the continuing need for caution and vigilance as a further , cases and two deaths linked to the virus were recorded.Mr Swann, who revealed at the weekend that he had tested positive for Covid, said: “With the reduced threat from the Omicron iant, we can move away from an emergency and legalistic framework to a new approach where making safer choices is embedded in our daily lives.“That means all of us continuing to do our best to cut down risks of infection and transmission.“It means looking after each other by following the public health guidance. It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others.“The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.Vaccine certication will continue to be available to the public – including for those who need it for travel abroad to satisfy entry requirements of countries they are visiting.Related topicsRobin SwannMore On Robin SwannBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normality PremiumLisa SmythOpinionRobin Swann left in unenviable position over Covid- restrictionsHealth Minister Robin Swann tests positive for Covid-Most ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceSam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Tayto Park#s massive new attraction #World of Raptors# with rare birds of preyLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoLatestLate Kylian Mbappe goal gives Paris St Germain the edge against Real MadridRussian Ambassador to Ireland says Ukraine invasion would be ‘insane’‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyHealth Minister promises action on waiting listsManchester City on brink of Champions League last eight after Sporting rout,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont department PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThe idea NI’s dficulty is nationalism’s opportunity is corrosive...

It must always be remembered that taking unnecessary risks with Covid may affect people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.“So please do not jump the gun and start behaving asthe pandemic is over. That is not the case.“While Omicron is less severe than previous strains of the virus, community transmission remains very high and hospital pressures signicant.“The most vulnerable as a result of underlying disease remain susceptible to severe illness and it is important that we all do what we can to protect them.”Mr Swann warned that coronavirus “is likely to stay with us in some form for some time” but he said emergency restrictions cannot remain in place indefinitely.He continued: “A large part of what we currently do to protect ourselves is already covered by guidance rather than regulations.“This includes self-isolating when infected and taking lateral flow tests before meeting up with others. The guidance will continue to emphasise all the steps that we should keep taking to protect each other.“I will, of course, keep the situation on regulations under ongoing and detailed review. We cannot rule out a new iant emerging down the line with new interventions being required. I very much hope that will not be the case.”Mr Swann has made the announcement having received the latest public health assessment from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser.“The expectation from the public health assessments is that no signicant rise in ICU occupancy is expected,” he continued.“While many people will very much welcome my decision on regulations, I know there will be concerns. Community transmission is still very high and our hospitals remain under severe pressure.“A sustained effort to follow the public health guidance will help reduce infection numbers and support our health service.”As the hospitality sector will continue to be encouraged to use Covid certicates, Mr Swann said the importance of wearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings “will continue to be strongly emphasised”.The Covid- regulations in Northern Ireland are not due to expire until March , but had been reviewed by the Executive every three weeks.The resignation of First Minister Paul Givan complicated the process of lting the remaining rules.Mr Swann was advised on the potential legal complications of him replacing regulations with guidance, without the wider endorsement of an Executive.On Monday Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Stormont ministers had given their unanimous support to Mr Swann to ease restrictions.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannMichelle O#NeillPaul GivanMore On The Executive Office PremiumCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekParties’ apology for abuse victims ‘will be welcomed’ PremiumNiamh CampbellOpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityPoll’s negative comments on bonfires and flags in north Down criticisedCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young peopleMost ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceSam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Tayto Park#s massive new attraction #World of Raptors# with rare birds of preyLatest Northern Ireland‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceNI Speaker announces fresh measures to pass legislation before Assembly pollJustice minister hails progress on sexual offences billNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in LatestCristiano Ronaldo ends barren spell as Man Utd labour to victory over BrightonLate Kylian Mbappe goal gives Paris St Germain the edge against Real MadridRussian Ambassador to Ireland says Ukraine invasion would be ‘insane’‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyHealth Minister promises action on waiting lists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Another input that has seen a signicant rise in price is fuel. It takes approximately L of diesel to produce an acre of potatoes.“Last year, red diesel was hovering around  per litre: at the minute it’s closer to p L.”Mr Meredith said some of the chemistry used in potato production has also experienced huge increases in price over the past few months.“Some products have doubled in price in the space of six months,” he added.Most ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceSam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Tayto Park#s massive new attraction #World of Raptors# with rare birds of preyLatest Northern Ireland‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceNI Speaker announces fresh measures to pass legislation before Assembly pollJustice minister hails progress on sexual offences billNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in LatestCristiano Ronaldo ends barren spell as Man Utd labour to victory over BrightonLate Kylian Mbappe goal gives Paris St Germain the edge against Real MadridRussian Ambassador to Ireland says Ukraine invasion would be ‘insane’‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyHealth Minister promises action on waiting lists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Allan PrestonTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn Irish language group at Queen’s University, Belfast, has laughed off criticism from the Orange Order over plans for a language residency scheme – claiming it was the loyal institution that had inspired their move.The proposals from the An Cumann Gaelach group at Queen’s have not yet been approved, and would house Irish language students together in halls of residence.Similar schemes already exist in other universities in the Irish Republic, Wales and Scotland.This was met with an angry response from the Student Orange Society and its student and alumni lodge, who issued a joint statement claiming it was encouraging “ision”.Joshua Patterson, Worshipful Master of Queen’s LOL , said that universities should be a shared space between students of dferent political and religious backgrounds but the residency scheme “encourages ision, further isolating those from a Unionist background in University le and wider society.”Responding to the criticism on Twitter, the An Cummann Gaelach group said the inspiration for the scheme had actually been taken from the Orange Order.The message read: “Despite their depressing view on our new scéim chónaithe, when we began plans for a living scheme, one of the first examples we looked at was ‘Croom Elbow’, the Orange Society’s own university living scheme.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Referring to information on Queen’s University LOL  website, the Croom Elbow property is used by the lodge for meetings, events and also by the Orange Societies of both of Ulster’s universities.There are also said to be vacancies for tenants at competitive rates each year open to members of the institution and others.An Cummann Gaelach added: “Everyone owns the language. Our proposed living scheme will be a welcoming environment for all, it will help normalise the language and soften such sharp views.”Also adding to the criticism was TUV Assembly candidate for North Belfast, Ron McDowell, who accused Queen’s of taking “a retrograde step”, although no decision has yet been made.“No one has any issue with the use of Irish or any other language but the proposal to mark part of the accommodation off as for Irish language speakers only will have the consequence of making one section of the community feel unwelcome in that area and will feed the perception that Queen’s is a cold house for Unionists,” he said.A university spokesperson commented: “Following requests made to the University Leadership by students and staff, Queen’s is currently considering the development of a residential language scheme that will be available to students studying degrees with languages or a language element offered by the University.This initiative is based on similar programs currently available in other universities to help promote and develop a deeper understanding of languages and linguistic ersity.​“Students who apply for this type of accommodation option will be selected in accordance with the eligibility criteria set out in the current University Allocation Policy, and must have already secured an accommodation place. No institutional decision has yet been made on the request, which will follow our standard governance, approval and equality screening processes, following the development of a robust proposal.”Most ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceSam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Tayto Park#s massive new attraction #World of Raptors# with rare birds of preyLatest Northern Ireland‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceNI Speaker announces fresh measures to pass legislation before Assembly pollJustice minister hails progress on sexual offences billNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in Latest‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyHealth Minister promises action on waiting listsManchester City on brink of Champions League last eight after Sporting routIrreverent author and commentator PJ O’Rourke dies aged Watch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidance,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.Both Ms Hargey and Mr Murphy moved on Tuesday to explain that the two projects were at dferent stages of progression, with the Casement redevelopment a live project that had been approved by the Executive, while the sub regional stadia programme had not reached the stage of identying what works would be undertaken.In the Assembly, Mr Frew accused accused the Sinn Fein ministers of “playing silly games” with the issue.“The sports regional sports stadium for football funding and the Casement Park funding has both been approved by this Executive,” he said.“Why has this finance minister and the communities minister made sectarian decisions to proceed with Casement Park, but to stop and halt the sports stadiums for

consequences of collapsing the Executive.“In scrambling to defend your own seats you haven’t thought through what the impact of that will be, and the impact is going to be very, very real across a range of communities and sports stadia are one,” he said.“The sub regional stadia have not identied any specic projects and would require to come back to the Executive for further approval.“The fact that you have collapsed the Executive means that all those clubs who are waiting on money will continue to wait on money until such times as you grow up and start to play at serious politics.”At a later press conference, Mr Murphy added: “To try and describe that as sectarian is an insult.”Minister Hargey insisted the funding for the programme was secure.The minister said while she would examine “other ways” to progress the initiative, she was signicantly limited by the absence of an executive.“I am ready to bring proposals forward before the end of this mandate,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.“The budget is there and I do think that it’s incumbent upon those other parties, particularly the DUP that chose to walk away, to look at that because this is the impact of their decision.”Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton dismissed Minister Hargey’s comments.“Deirdre Hargey has been in office for two years but has failed to deliver on an NDNAagreement to advance funding for football stadiums across Northern Ireland,” he said.“There is an Executive commitment on sub-regional stadia funding.“That could have been delivered upon at any time during the last two years, and it still should be delivered today.“For two years she has dithered, telling everyone that a result was just around the corner, but still today nothing has been delivered.”Most ReadStephen Nolan explores

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. There were also delays caused by the pandemic.Shortly before Wren was tucked into bed at the family home, Patrick and Jon told this newspaper about the emotional moment Charley offered to carry their baby five years ago.Patrick, who had assumed that fostering or adoption was their only choice, said: “We didn’t really think this would ever be an option for us. “We’d heard of people going to America for surrogacy but had heard it could cost , . That was something we could only dream of.“When we were talking about it, people would say, ‘I would love to do that for you, but...’.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A few weeks after Charley had mentioned in passing that she would help, she sat the couple down to say she was serious.Jon recalled: “From that point, it felt like a possibility. She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”The couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby.“[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened.“There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family. Just because ours is a little bit dferent doesn’t make it any less of a family.“It also prepared us to tell people that it wasn’t a very nice question. And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant. That’s Jon and Patrick’s baby’. Charley would be killing herself laughing.”After the “heart wrenching” pain of losing the first pregnancy, Patrick faced dark timesHe recalled: “I was in turmoil some of the times, but when you look back, it was all just washed away when Wren was here.”When the couple announced the new pregnancy, their families were delighted. Jon said: “I had never seen our parents and siblings cry with that kind of joy — they couldn’t believe it.”The day of Wren’s birth was a “surreal” experience filled with hope but also concern.But they had little reason to worry because after Wren was born just before am, the new family was at home together by dinner time.Jon said: “On that drive home and going into the house, you’re thinking, ‘Right we’re supposed to know how to look after this baby’.“It was a lot to take in, but it was amazing at the same time to know that she was ours.” Jon and Patrick are sharing their parenting story on their Instagram page.

If they don’t want to wear it, that’s up to them. “At the start, I would’ve been a bit like, ‘Why are you not wearing your mask ’ Now, as long as I’m doing it, I don’t mind what other people do.” On the other hand, Stephanie Crilly and Minnie Brown, from Ballymena, were glad to see the back of face coverings.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Personally, I don’t think masks are hygienic. You find them lying around the streets all the time,” said Stephanie . “I just don’t think people are using them correctly. I think it’s much better that now it’s everyone’s own preference.”The pair also stressed that they would be adhering to social distancing, which they feel is more important in controlling the spread of the virus.Englishman John Addy , the assistant director of the Open University in Ireland, joked that while he was “not a pessimist normally”, he would be wearing a mask because it “is a socially responsible and caring thing to do”.“I don’t think this pandemic is over yet. We don’t know what’s coming around the corner. I also quite like not getting colds, which I haven’t done in recent years, so for the time being I’m going to carry on,” he added.Echoing his sentiments, John Murray , from north Belfast, said he would “definitely” keep wearing a mask after recovering from Covid last Friday, following  days of positive tests.He explained: “At the end of the day, you’re protecting yourself and protecting others from youyou’ve got the infection.“It’s all very well taking away restrictions, but after working in the health service for over  years, it’s about what happens next. At the minute, the present version [of the virus] is not killing too many people, but who knows what’s round the corner. I’m happy enough as long as I’m wearing my mask.”City centre shop owners said that many customers, particularly elderly people, were continuing to wear masks inside. “Many older customers still do wear masks, but we haven’t really been wearing ours and we leave it up to the customer,” explained William Ferris, manager of McNeilly’s Jewellers.Noting that many people glasses steamed up while indoors, he added: “It’s good to see people without them because people feel uncomfortable or can’t feel at ease with them on.”Aaron Chism, owner of the clothing store Fuzz Vintage, said many people he knew had grown tired of masks.“I’d say maybe % or % still wear them. I suppose people are vaccinated and things are going back to normal, so why not [abandon them entirely]  “From the start, there’s always doubts about stuff like that. I’m fully vaccinated, but with masks, after hearing about government parties and stuff like that going on,they’re not doing it, why should we ” Most ReadStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryAll Covid- restrictions to be lted in Northern Ireland from TuesdayNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceSam McBrideOpinionWhen you get into the weeds, there’s a lot more to these polls than Sinn Fein becoming Northern Ireland’s biggest partyUnionist issues with judiciary ‘should be treated as legitimate debate’, says loyalist Jamie BrysonTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Tayto Park#s massive new attraction #World of Raptors# with rare birds of preyLatest Northern Ireland‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyNI Speaker announces fresh measures to pass legislation before Assembly pollJustice minister hails progress on sexual offences billNorthern Irish exports across border reached nearly bn euros in Sinn Fein ministers accused of ‘sectarian decisions’ over stadium fundingLatestCristiano Ronaldo ends barren spell as Man Utd labour to victory over BrightonLate Kylian Mbappe goal gives Paris St Germain the edge against Real MadridRussian Ambassador to Ireland says Ukraine invasion would be ‘insane’‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads makes surrogacy historyHealth Minister promises action on waiting lists,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users.

At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February .

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The spending plan had been out for public consultation when the DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the administration as part of its protest against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.The draft budget had proposed a % increase in health spending in Northern Ireland, with £ billion earmarked for services over the next three years.The plan would have left other departments facing some tough choices as a result of the % cash increase for the health budget.While none of the other departments would have seen a reduction in their baseline allocation from the last budget, they would have been % down on what they would have expected to receiveextra funding were not being erted to health.“Since the resignation of the first minister I have considered all possible avenues that might have allowed me to proceed with a budget, including bringing it directly to the Assembly,” Mr Murphy told MLAs on Tuesday.“Unfortunately, the legal advice is clear that the budget must be agreed by the executive.“This means that on April  the health service will not be able to plan on a three-year basis, nor will it be equipped with additional resources to invest in waiting lists, cancer services and mental health.“In these circumstances, rather than improving, the health service will decline.”Mr Murphy said he had decided to pause the public consultation exercise on the draft budget.“Last week the Health Ministerapologised to people on waiting lists because without a multi-year budget, the opportunity to rebuild the health service would be ‘cruelly taken away’,” he said.“That analysis is sadly correct, although it should be the DUP apologising for the damage it is inflicting on the health service, not Minister Swann.”On the ability of spending hundreds of millions of carried over funds next year, Mr Murphy said: “Departments cannot plan to make use of this additional £ million in funding.“Instead the money will sit idle, until such times as an executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy said he would make a £ million in-year reallocation of Stormont funds to ensure the administration did not breach the limit of underspent cash it can carry over into the next financial year.This money will go to the departments of communities, education and infrastructure.“Having considered this matter at some , and taken legal advice, I intend to proceed to make allocations to these departments,” he said.“I have written to ministers to ask them for their views on this course of action and have made clear to them that the alternative is that funding that could be used to support local people and services might instead be lost to the Treasury.”Mr Murphy also highlighted the need to provide match funding for community groups supported through the European Social Fund .He urged DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to prioritise the ESF match funding from within his own budget.The draft budget had proposed a continuation of the current freeze on both the domestic and non-domestic regional rates for the next three years.Mr Murphy said that freeze could now only be continued for one year.“This freeze was intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike,” he said.“On the basis of legal advice, I can proceed with this freeze for one year only.“That means that households and businesses will not have certainty on their rates for the subsequent two years.”Mr Murphy said he would proceed with a proposed £ million rate relief package for businesses.The package would deliver a three-month rates holiday for sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, retail, tourism, hospitality, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports.“The executive should be on the cusp of agreeing a multi-year budget which prioritises health,” Mr Murphy added.“It should be deciding how to invest an additional £ million next year for housing, for skills, for the police, and for ESF match funding.“Due to the reckless actions of the DUP, this is not possible.“Instead, public services will operate on an emergency basis, without the benefits of long-term planning or additional resources, until such times as the executive is re-established.”Mr Murphy’s appearance before MLAs witnessed some sharp exchanges with DUP members.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan accused the minister of “amnesia”, highlighting that Sinn Fein pulled down the administration in  and left the region without a budget.“Minister, I see in your statement the Democratic Unionist Partyhas been mentioned four times but strangely no mention of your own party when they pulled this entire Assembly down in early  – no budget, no health support, no nothing,” he said.“Surely a case of amnesia from the members on the far side of the house, purely for political gain.“Can you and other parties not see the damage the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to this place, are you blind to seeing that ”Mr Murphy insisted that the renewable heat incentivecontroversy that prompted the collapse of powersharing in  would have brought down any coalition government.He told Mr Buchanan: “Your party’s decision in order to scramble to save your own seatsis having very real consequences, a lot of them apparently unforeseen or not thought through by your party, is having very real consequences for the communities that we represent and you should own that yourself.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe law changes on Monday, March , removing the legal defence of reasonable punishment and opening the possibility for anyone who smacks a child to be prosecuted for assault.The Welsh Government passed the law change two years ago, seeing off opposition in the Senedd to win a vote - on what was described as a “landmark day for children in Wales”The government said the law change would help “protect children and their rights, and give them the best start in le”. By banning smacking, ministers argue children in Wales are now given the same protections from assault as adults.Physical punishmentis \"not a necessary part of disciplining children\" and \"doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour\", the Welsh Government advises, adding that such punishments can hurt children and give them the message violence is an \"appropriate response to strong feelings\".The new law will apply to everyone in Wales, including visitors, and £. million is being invested in parenting support services.Advice and support for parents and s is available on the Welsh Government’s Give It Time website https:gov.wales parenting-give-it-time.Children’s charities like Barnardo’s Cymru and the NSPCC have supported the law change, but the ban has not been welcomed universally.As well as some opposition in the Senedd, mainly from the Welsh Conservatives, a campaign group called Be Reasonable argued the move would “inevitably catch ordinary, loving parents and turn them into criminals”, and their petition against the government’s proposals collected nearly , signatures in Wales.And the Welsh Government’s own studies suggest members of the public are equally ided over the issue.Researchers carried out three surveys between  and  to gauge public opinion on banning the physical punishment of children..removeWhile support for a smacking ban grew in , research shows that level fell slightly a year later. If anything, people’s opinions have become less rigid, with more people in  than in previous years saying they would need more information before deciding whether they agreed with the law change.Among those members of the public who said they supported a smacking ban in the last survey, more than one-thirdsaid they did not agree generally with the physical punishment of children.Other common reasons for supporting the ban included the belief there were other good forms of ensuring good behaviour and discipline , and the belief smacking was abuse, or could lead to abuse .Meanwhile, one in four peoplewho said they opposed the smacking ban in the most recent survey did so because they believed physical punishment was needed to control behaviour, the discipline a child, to teach respect or to show boundaries.Other common reasons for opposing the law change included the belief smacking doesn’t do any harm– including cases when people said it hadn’t done themselves or their own children any harm – and that smacking was OKit was a reasonable punishment and doesn’t go too far.Not everyone who smacks a child from March  will be automatically prosecuted. Wales four police forces have been encouraged to consider a \"rehabilitative alternative to prosecution\"this is more appropriate.\"In cases where the police decide it is appropriate to offer an out of court disposal, there will be an option of tailored parenting support to encourage positive parenting techniques and help avoid re-offending,\" the government has advised.Those parenting support schemes will be offered by councils. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table..remove“In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind.”Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £ of support for households across England to deal with rising energy bills over the year from April .Some £ of the support will take the form of a council tax rebate for all ratepayers in council tax bands A to D.The Treasury also announced that devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would be given a total of £ million extra funding to carry out the same measure.Last week Wales’ first minister Mark Drakeford said there was “no extra money for Wales” from the Treasury to provide the rebate.His claim came after the UK Government’s Welsh secretary accused the devolved Welsh Government of leaving its taxpayers “unclear” about whether they would be getting a £ council tax rebate to help with energy bills.Jane Hutt, minister for social justice in Wales, said: “The funding we are announcing today will ensure more people get more support, in what are challenging circumstances for so many families in Wales.“As bills rise, prices go up and wages are stretched we know people will need help, that’s why I’ve convened a Wales-wide Cost of Living Summit on Thursday  February, with over  participants from a wide range of social partners and third sector organisations across Wales to discuss the crisis and the proactive actions we can take to support people across Wales.“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis remains a crucial priority for this Government and we will continue to consider all the options available to us.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aecbbbaacfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfecfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
