So is it now safe to view art – and how will they cope with the drastic drop in numbers?‘There was a moment,” says Andrew Nairne, “when I was thinking, of course, we are like Nottingham Contemporary and the Hepworth Wakefield, places like that.” The director of Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge is guiding me around a gallery that’s “in rehearsals” for a socially distanced opening in August. “Then I remembered that the others don’t have a little cottage with tiny rooms and narrow corridors.”Today, the National Gallery in London is reopening after Covid-19 abruptly shut the doors of British museums in mid-March. But Kettle’s Yard, like many others, is taking a slower, phased approach. The institution regularly hosts shows in its new, airy galleries – an exhibition from the artist Linder will be extended into the autumn – but at its heart is the home of its founder, curator and collector Jim Ede. This takes the form of a series of knocked-through cottages, their awkward-shaped rooms brimming with art and delicate objects. It is meant to be a warm, hospitable place where visitors are allowed the freedom to sit in armchairs, leaf through books left out on tables, and generally feel at home. All of which also makes it a social-distancing nightmare.Visitors have long had to book for a tour round the Edes’ house. They still will, but a maximum of 18, rather than 72, will be able to come each day. Hand sanitisers will be much in evidence, and visor-clad staff will figure out how to steer guests so they clash with neither each other, nor the precious objects. Ventilation has been fiercely debated.“I said, ‘For heaven’s sake, can’t we just fling open some windows?” Nairne says. The answer was: “On no account.” The gorgeous Alfred Wallis paintings require proper climate control, although the air flow in the cottage has been deemed safe. The cafe, which normally occupies a tiny footprint into which tables are ingeniously crammed, will offer takeaways so that visitors can eat in the garden.Similar dilemmas are being confronted by museums across the UK. Those in England and Northern Ireland, bar locked-down Leicester, have been allowed to reopen since last weekend Scotland and Wales expect the green light later this month. “We want the experience to feel safe, but also inviting, so that people aren’t scared,” says Alfredo Cramerotti, director of Mostyn gallery in Llandudno, who hopes to begin a phased reopening at the end of this month. They will be asking people to wear masks inside the gallery. “It’s better not to pretend everything’s normal,” he says. “It’s not.”When I paid an early visit at the weekend, the National Gallery was looking cleaner and fresher than I’ve ever known it. A choice of one-way routes is now prescribed, and booking a time slot is mandatory (though still, of course, free). Being able to see art in a museum again, after nearly four months, was joyful. Those able to visit will have a memorable experience – without the usual crowds. “Normally,” says director Gabriele Finaldi, “we expect around 15,000 visitors a day. Early on, we expect between a fifth and a quarter of that.”But months of total closure, followed by radically reduced visitor numbers for the foreseeable future, is a financial disaster. This is equally true for museums that charge for entrance and for those that are free but rely on visitors spending money in shops and restaurants, and buying tickets for one-off shows. Finaldi tells me he is looking at the loss of £8-12m on a turnover of £48m. He has cancelled an exhibition of Dutch paintings, and delayed a Raphael show from 2021 to 2022.“We are a high-volume, low-margin operation,” he says. “During the period of lockdown, we would have had around 100,000 people through the door, each with a spend of around £20.” It is also a strongly seasonal attraction, with the bulk of visitors coming in the summer. Not this year. “It’s like three winters in a row.”The price, for some, of reopening to very few visitors is deemed too high just now. For museums run by local councils, taking staff off furlough, or deploying workers back into museums from other services, may require tricky calculations about relative social value. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum is run and largely funded by Exeter city council. “Reopening,” said a spokesman, “has to balance the value of the museum to the social, economic and cultural life of the city against the need to preserve the council’s scarce financial resources.”In other words, the money is needed elsewhere no reopening date has been set. You might think that being closed anyway for a new project – as is the case with Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery – would be serendipitous. But a complete stop, followed by socially distanced work, means a delayed project, which means costs. “At the moment,” says Fiona Bradley, its director, “I feel quite far away from people’s agonies about hand-sanitiser and one-way systems.” The revamped gallery was supposed to open in August. The date now given is February. “Covid-19 has cost us half a million pounds,” says Bradley.“We desperately need donations, help from our patrons and member and some kind of bailout,” says director Andrew Mackay. “Otherwise, I don’t see us surviving.” All the museum directors I speak to say the same: donations from supporters and visitors are more needed than ever.There will be sacrifices when visits become so highly controlled, often through bookable time slots. Finaldi says he will miss the casual commuter or passerby popping into the National Gallery for a few moments before catching a train from nearby Charing Cross station. “We have a learning space usually open 361 days a year, with lots of craft and making activities,” says Beth Bate, director of Dundee Contemporary Arts (DCA). Usually families can just wander in. Now there will have to be a booking system. “We will lose something from that,” she says.All the museum directors, large and small, say that reopening safely and rescheduling exhibitions is actually the easy part. The difficulties will come in a year or two. Those most dependent on international tourism do not expect visitor numbers to recover for some time. There will be no V-shaped recovery here. Budgets will be tighter. “Blockbusters will be fewer and further between,” says Finaldi.The emergency package will provide no silver bullet, and all eyes will be on the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s autumn statement. Everyone is thinking about how to work differently, how to make more money, how to spend less. “It’s a great moment to really use our collections, to share them with our near neighbours,” says Simon Wallis, director of the Hepworth Wakefield, who plans to reopen on 1 August, which is Yorkshire Day. “We can save money by not lugging art from all corners of the world – the insurance costs for doing so in recent years have been eye-watering.” Not to mention, he adds, the costs to the planet.Bate, meanwhile, is thinking about how DCA can work even more closely with her local authority in Dundee, on such issues as community cohesion, health and wellbeing. Amid all the crushing uncertainty there is still a sense of defiance and hope. “I’ve never seen people do so much with so little,” says Wallis. “We will come up with imaginative solutions. If we in the arts are not going to, who is?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f73193aeb0aa9d669019de3c4954d2f256b0614/0_0_1949_1299/master/1949.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5edfbf5b13e2857dff1a4da468ee8cb2 720w","title":"a lot of worry residents of other melbourne housing blocks want more done to stave off covid 19","story":"High-rise public housing tenants cite mobile testing, more cleaning and hand sanitiser among key needs The Victorian government is facing calls to bring mobile testing into all of Melbourne’s high-rise public housing estates and to ramp up cleaning and culturally appropriate resources to prevent a repeat of the “hard lockdown” inflicted on 3,000 residents since Saturday.As the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, cited a record 191 new cases while reintroducing stage 3 restrictions across Melbourne, residents in other large high-rise towers across the inner city still expressed fear about the prospect of their own hard lockdown and said they were frustrated by a lack of resources and support.It is hoped that the 3,000 people subjected to the “hard lockdown” in the nine towers in Flemington and north Melbourne – which prevents them from leaving their building under any circumstances – will be brought back into line with the rest of the city from midnight Wednesday.But just on the other side of Melbourne’s CBD, at the Carlton public housing estate, Cory Memery, 48, said a lack of action by authorities at his high-rise block was causing a “a lot of worry” among residents.Many of his concerns were the same as those that residents in the north Melbourne and Flemington estates had raised with authorities months ago, as reported by the  on Tuesday.In Carlton, there was very little hand sanitiser in common areas and it was intended to be shared between hundreds of people, Memery said, standing next to the building’s housing office, closed due to the pandemic.“There needs to be hand sanitiser on every floor,” he told the . “That is an absolute given.”Memery said there had been no discernible difference in his building. “It’s just the normal practices, they come up and clean my floor once a fortnight. It’s been that way forever. I haven’t seen the cleaning brigade who go out and do the tram stops come in here, but I have seen that in other estates.”East of the Carlton estate, Penelope Drummond was watching the situation in Flemington and North Melbourne unfold on television from her north Richmond high-rise flat and feeling “very anxious”.She thought the cleaning services had definitely been improved in her building – one of five in the massive estate – but was worried about hundreds of residents being forced to share only two lifts.“There is cleaning going on in the lift. I see there are extra cleaners going around,” Drummond said. “Is it enough? No. Is anything enough?“A lot of people are wearing masks because they have heard that is the right thing to do in this environment.”Drummond agreed with calls for mobile testing to be brought to her estate. “I would like to think that would happen here as a preventative measure.”Later on Tuesday, Nine News reported a resident at the Flemington high-rise who had tested positive had also worked at the north Richmond estate, where he had patrolled three floors in one of the buildings.The state government is now facing calls from political opponents on its left and right for an increased testing regime in public housing estates.The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, whose electorate takes in most of Melbourne’s inner-city public housing high-rises, on Tuesday wrote to the government with his state Greens colleague Ellen Sandell calling for more resources and mobile testing.“There is no excuse for communal hand sanitiser bottles being empty for days on end in a pandemic or for lifts to be out of action,” he told the .“We also need priority on-site testing at these towers, so residents can be cleared of the virus as soon as possible and treatment given to those who test positive.”The left-leaning City of Yarra council was expected to pass a motion on Tuesday night calling on the government to provide mobile testing for all public housing residents, among other measures.Stephen Jolly, a veteran councillor in Yarra, where there are 12 public housing high-rises, said residents were worried there was nothing being done to prevent their own estates facing a hard lockdown.“We need testing,” he said. “And if someone tests positive, it shouldn’t be that we lock down the whole tower. We don’t do that for private blocks of units.”The Victorian Liberals’ housing spokesman, Tim Smith, said there should be “compulsory testing in all public housing”.“If anyone tests positive in public housing, they must be immediately quarantined in either hospital or appropriate crisis accommodation,” he told the NCA Newswire.But Ranko Cosic, a community leader and resident at the Atherton Gardens estate in Fitzroy, baulked at the idea of mandatory testing.He said bringing testing to residents in the public housing flats was a “very good option”.“I think the residents should have a choice, otherwise it comes across like you’re being forced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f2598cf1297d2aae0e14965fd1cb4ddc56860a2/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f30635c8a6f3b7c3b06fcebd632de926","title":"lifting of lockdown in england how do you feel reopening has gone","story":"We would like to hear from business owners and people who have visited pubs and restaurants to tell us how reopening has been Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England are some of the businesses that  were able to reopen from 4 July.

Jobs will go at all at JLR’s major factories, including Castle Bromwich, Solihull, Ellesmere Port and Halewood.The news come just weeks after Tata-owned JLR, Britain’s biggest automotive company, announced it would cut 1,100 agency jobs, after losing £500m in three months as the pandemic halted production and closed car showrooms.Last month, industry body the SMMT warned that up to one in six UK automotive jobs were at risk without a dedicated government support package.DHL said: “In light of highly challenging trading conditions in the global automotive sector and the unprecedented impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to restructure our linefeed and freight operations supporting the Jaguar Land Rover contract.“We are now in consultation with our employees and their representatives and will make every effort to redeploy as many colleagues as possible to our other operations nationwide.”Draper said the union was awaiting details of proposed efficiency savings but warned that DHL should not “force staff to undertake impossible workloads as they show other workers the door”. It called on JLR to step in.He added: “While DHL is the employer, the reality is that the workers perform their roles for JLR. JLR has a moral duty to ensure that workers are treated fairly and decently during this incredibly difficult and stressful time.”A JLR spokesman said: “DHL informed us that they were going into consultation with some of their workforce last month.“Through its ongoing transformation programme and against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, Jaguar Land Rover is taking action to optimise performance and achieve further operational efficiencies to enable sustainable growth and safeguard the long-term success of our business.”JLR had already been grappling with major problems in the years before the pandemic, including sales ing in China in 2018-19 and demand falling in the UK through what it described as the “headwinds” of Brexit and consumers avoiding new diesel vehicles.The latest UK automotive manufacturing job losses follow cuts at Aston Martin, Bentley and Nissan since the pandemic started.

These roles are lost as firms come to rely increasingly on computer systems to perform administrative functions, leaving jobs growth confined to professional and low-skilled operations.“These results point to the possibility that the Covid-19 shock will reinforce the existing trend of employment polarisation.”Stefano Scarpetta, the director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD, said he was especially concerned that a generation of young people would be denied employment or retraining, restricting their ability to gain a sustainable, skilled job.“In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, governments acted far too late to address the labour market difficulties of youth, which left them with long-lasting scars that were still visible before the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.“There is no time to waste to put in place a comprehensive policy package ensuring that no young worker is left behind.”The OECD also had a warning for all governments over the coming months, saying they must guard against a slap-dash approach to Covid-19 safety standards to protect the half of workers who will come into close contact with colleagues and customers as part of their job.Fearing a second wave of the pandemic in the autumn, it said ministers should also extend sick leave to allow staff to self-isolate if they discover they have coronavirus symptoms.The OECD said: “About half of all workers are employed in a job that requires significant physical interactions and therefore face a risk of contagion. Strong occupational safety and health standards, defined and enforced by public authorities andor by social partners, remain a top priority.“Paid sick leave can continue to perform an important role in containing and mitigating the spread of the virus and protecting the incomes, jobs and health of sick workers and their families. Moving forward, countries should consider closing long-known gaps in paid sick-leave regulations while reinforcing work incentives and employment support to facilitate a return to work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90627a3db3ba168b635c339313399fe0ae8a1b64/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256646bf0076b258161ab420d3714668","title":"no business need at all now for a chinese nuclear plant in the uk","story":"Halting Huawei hurts 5G rollout and Sino-British ties, but stopping a Chinese nuclear power plant in Essex has virtually no falloutGet ready for the “new Huawei” is the word from Westminster, meaning another flare-up in UK-China business and political relations, this time over Chinese involvement in the UK’s nuclear power programme.Ditching state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) would indeed be a political development on a political par with a Huawei exclusion. The 2016 agreement, which imagined CGN’s “progressive entry” into the UK’s “resurgent” nuclear ambitions, was given maximum hype at the time by both Beijing and David Cameron’s government.But here’s the good news: unlike with Huawei, where a ban would seriously disrupt 5G rollout in the UK, there are few direct downsides to excluding CGN. The UK does not need Chinese nuclear technology.The major impact would be at Bradwell in Essex, the prize CGN was really seeking – the first Chinese-built nuclear plant outside China.But the Bradwell proposal is years away from being approved, and already looks surplus to need for the reasons the National Infrastructure Commission offered in its most recent long-term assessment: “Given the balance of cost and risk, a renewables-based system looks a safer bet at present than constructing multiple new nuclear power plants.”The NIC thought only one new big nuclear plant needed to be commissioned before 2025 – and that, presumably, will be Sizewell. Cancelling Bradwell would involve no real sacrifice on the part of the UK.In fact, the CameronOsborne nuclear vision has aged horribly in four years. The offshore wind revolution has accelerated and the industry’s costs now beat nuclear’s every time. If replacement nuclear capacity is still deemed essential for baseload purposes, the aim should be to build as few mega-plants as possible.Advances in battery storage technology should further tilt the economics in favour of renewables. While we wait, small modular reactors look a nimbler nuclear alternative. Rolls-Royce is in the development vanguard on that front, and carries no geopolitical headaches.In short, for purely business reasons, one would rip up that 2016 agreement in an instant.Online fashion retailing is a fast and furious place, as Boohoo should know at the flick of a few switches, its clothes have been delisted from the websites of Next, Asos and Zalando.The industry’s response is impressively speedy – and far clearer than the confused messaging from Boohoo’s boardroom in response to allegations of illegal pay rates at a factory in Leicester producing its clothes. The factory may have been operated by an unauthorised subcontractor, as Boohoo said, but that’s not an excuse it’s up to the retailer to control its supply chain.A temporary loss of sales on a few third-party websites may be tolerable, but Boohoo’s breezy image will suffer permanent damage if this saga drags on. Mahmud Kamani, founder and executive chairman of Boohoo, needs to get a grip.He should do what most observers are advising: appoint an outside auditor or lawyer to examine what went wrong. The failure to take that obvious step looks more perverse by the day. Does he also need Next \u0026amp co to give him lessons in how to manage a crisis?There’s a deficit in the pension fund, it should be said. But three times earnings is still a spectacularly gloomy assessment of long-term prospects. That’s not to say it’s wrong, of course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07777a22be399ed742225036468bdc8059d3c01d/0_58_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfd042f4bc9e98eac5a80db701d4963","title":"rishi sunak mini budget leftwing labour coronavirus public spending state ownership political agenda","story":"The impact of coronavirus on the economy means high public spending and state ownership are top of the political agendaBack in December, a major plank of the Conservative party’s general election strategy was to portray Jeremy Corbyn as a Marxist throwback, committed to all sorts of dangerous 1970s lefty ideas such as state ownership and higher public spending.Six months later, Boris Johnson felt the need, when announcing plans to bring forward £5bn of investment in Britain’s clapped-out public infrastructure, to reassure voters that he was “not a communist” and still believed in capitalism.It’s easy to see why the prime minister felt the need to provide some reassurance to his party’s traditional supporters, who believed the Conservatives stood for a small state, free enterprise and sound public finances. Johnson has nationalised the railways, is paying the wages of about a third of the workforce and is on course to borrow more this year than any other prime minister in peacetime. If Corbyn had announced that he was prepared to take a stake in strategically important companies to stop them going bust, Johnson would have been the first to accuse the former Labour leader of “picking winners”. In a Covid-19 world, it is what the government does, if more out of necessity than conviction.Rishi Sunak’s summer statement on the economy on Wednesday is another indication of how things have changed in the first half of 2020. Normally chancellors are tight-fisted in the first year of parliament, getting all the tough decisions on tax and spending over with early so that they can hand out some goodies as election time approaches. They certainly don’t have mini-budgets where they announce that money’s no object if it means saving the National Theatre, or preventing the dole queues from lengthening to four million by the end of the year.To be sure there are experts – Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England for one – who think that the economy is recovering more quickly than expected, but the risk for Sunak is of doing too little rather than too much. His decision to end the government’s furlough scheme in October – when the jobless total is likely to be rising fast – is a colossal gamble and, quite possibly, a huge blunder. State spending takes on extra importance when unemployment is rising because the threat of redundancy leads people to save more. The drop in private spending makes the recession worse unless the government compensates by spending more itself.Michael Devereux, an Oxford university professor, says Sunak should consider topping up the wages of people who have returned to work but are operating at below full capacity, which makes sense given that it will take a long time for many businesses to return to normal trading.It is unlikely to happen though. In part, that’s because of traditional Treasury concerns about handing money to employers who might not need it. It’s also because this is a government that feels queasy about many of the things it is being forced to do.Thus far, there is nothing historically exceptional about what Johnson’s administration has been doing. Governments in the past have expanded the role of the state. They have used fiscal policy – tax, spending and borrowing – aggressively during recessions. They have bailed out troubled companies. They have argued that higher spending on infrastructure will pay for itself by shifting the economy into a higher gear.The problem for the Conservatives is that parties of the left have traditionally been more comfortable pushing these policies than parties of the right. Johnson likes to talk about his brand of one nation Conservatism, but somehow or another he has ended up with an economic strategy rather like that of Harold Wilson’s 1964-70 Labour government, with its National Plan for growth, high levels of public spending and belief in the transformative power of science and technology. It is certainly not Thatcherism, which is why free-market thinktanks are uncomfortable with the government’s direction of travel.For the time being, there is not much those who think Johnson’s dalliance with dangerous leftwing ideas will end in tears can do about it. They can point out that in some ways the lockdown has highlighted the strengths of the market, with many businesses finding all sorts of creative ways to keep themselves going. They also make the point that the way the government has handled the crisis – from its Soviet-style targets for testing to its chaotic air bridges – has not always been the best advertisement for an activist state.Politics goes in cycles and there will eventually be a moment when that thinking resonates with the public, but not now. For the moment, if the opinion polls are to be believed, voters are far more receptive to more stimulus and a rolling back of welfare cuts. The Resolution Foundation thinktank’s proposal for a £200bn spending boost, complete with £500 of spending vouchers for every adult, is far more in tune with the public mood than a return to austerity.This is not entirely surprising. As the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said on Tuesday, a pandemic is the ultimate collective action problem: it is simply not feasible to tell workers and companies that they must survive on their own as best they can when the government itself has been responsible for shutting down the economy.Nor is the mood likely to change all that quickly. The recession of the early 1990s was cured by Britain leaving the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Pouring money into the banks was the turning point in the financial crisis of 2008. This time, only a vaccine for Covid-19 will do the trick, and that could be years away.All of which creates a glorious opportunity for the Labour party. It is in the happy position of being able to say that no matter how much the government is spending it should be spending more. It can pick and choose from all the once taboo ideas – such as a basic income, a wealth tax, or printing money to pay for higher public spending – that have become fashionable. A green new deal is now so much part of the mainstream that the prime minister sees himself as the new Franklin D Roosevelt.A word of caution, though. Even assuming that Labour embraces the need for more radical action on global heating, it is not actually in power and won’t be for some time. The government has four years to patch up a dysfunctional economy which, despite all the rhetoric, is what Johnson’s strategy is really all about.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e714fdf3d7d72ca432ac2c623dfe9063fe70bd/0_198_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8aa5a4291accfad629ee8d9bcf2ac387","title":"expecting amy schumer pregnancy docuseries hbo","story":"In Expecting Amy, the comedian navigates marriage and a grueling pregnancy with her trademark candor, but what’s most compelling is left just outside of the frameAmy Schumer, the 39-year-old comedian and actor, spends much of Expecting Amy, the three-part docu-series on her turbo-charged first year of marriage, pregnancy and the development of her 2019 Netflix special Growing, hunched over and vomiting. Afflicted by hyperemesis, or acute morning sickness, Schumer braced against unrelenting nausea and a good thousand or so hurls, many of them filmed by her husband, sister or friends. There’s the comic, hours before a show, puking into a plastic bag, out the door of a car, into the toilet bowl at 3am a day before she’s to tape Growing at a comedy club in New York, she’s in the back of another car on the way to the ER, dehydrated and retching. “Oh shit, what about the taping?” her husband, the chef Chris Fischer, whom she married on Valentines Day 2018, asks from the front seat. “That’s seeming a little unlikely,” she manages, as she hasn’t kept down food or water for days.The HBO Max series, directed by Alexander Hammer and Ryan Cunningham, is, like much of Schumer’s comedy, a record of excess – in this case, of sickness, a body in revolt and, less prominent but richer, the demands of forwarding a highly public career throughout. Filmed from the fall of 2018 through 2019, the series is billed, in name and in structure (the first two episodes, available for critics, are titled “Conception” and “Gestation”) as a pregnancy series, one channeling Schumer’s longstanding brand of fearlessness, carnal humor and dicing of post-feminism’s hypocrisy and obfuscation into behind-the-scenes documentary. (Schumer and Fischer’s son, Gene, was born in May 2019).But like her recent comedy, the raunchier or more bodily transgressive things get, the less she seems to say. Expecting Amy works best as an exploration of comedy’s messy boundaries – what personal interactions get filtered, streamlined and edited into a set, what off-stage moments of wryness and levity form a stage persona, what shame or fear performance can excise or exploit. The series eschews any talking heads or much formality at all, instead relying on on-the-fly footage of Schumer and often Fischer, sister Kim Caramele, and friends Rachel Feinstein and Bridget Everett in cars, bathrooms, trains, splayed on backstage couches, on stage.Watching Expecting Amy, you get the sense that being “on” is not so much an act as who Schumer is bedridden in the ER for dehydration after days of vomiting, she’s still joking to her sister, disarmingly straightforward with the nurses. If she ever had a conscious onoff performance switch, she long ago lost track of it. But while Schumer’s brand of exposure and flouting taboos is boundless – one episode intro finds her sitting on the toilet in her hospital gown, half-asleep, struggling to pee – Expecting Amy stops short of revealing much about her clearly dauntless ambition, or grappling with the scrutiny of millions like Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana, Schumer’s series is most interesting not in the bulk of what is revealed, but what moments are hinted, seemingly off-hand, or left out.Expecting Amy convincingly portrays her as an Everywoman – stars puking through pregnancy, they’re just like us! – except Everywomen don’t get emails from Netflix greenlighting their proposed special while eating takeout. When celebrity and critique do encroach the frame – when she smiles and spars with a man taking photos of her on the train to Long Island, for example – the friction with Schumer’s roll-with-it disposition is palpable, fascinating, jarring.There are moments which seem to lead to a whole other series, tension aired but tantalizingly underexplored, particularly in regards to Fischer’s diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder (formerly known as Asperger’s), which occurs over the course of filming and is movingly embraced by the couple. Schumer, used to mining her personal life for jokes, frequently brings up Fischer’s sweetness, his as she calls it “different” brain, in her sets. But after one bit in which a gift intended to make her feel better is played to audience laughs, late in the second episode he broaches the subject, seemingly uncomfortable but not expressing so in as many words. “It’s not a normal circumstance, the circumstances that we have,” he says. “We’ve also talked about the separation between the performance and your art and your act with reality, too.”Schumer reacts defensively, more so to her marriage’s strained communication than her comedy. “Are we celebrating how strong you are, or are you telling me that you have a problem with me saying something on stage?” she says, adding: “My standup is not more important than our marriage.” The argument loops over, its threads picked up and put down, and feels raw and treacherously vulnerable in a way the many shots of Schumer’s nausea do not one wonders what those conversations of the line between reality and performance looked like.In press for Growing last year, Schumer seemed to embrace a life in evolution, in the potential for comedy’s thorny expansion. “I’m ecstatic and furious,” she told the New York Times. “And pleased and peaceful and manic and hopeless and so hopeful it’s crazy.” In its best moments, Expecting Amy embraces this kind of mess, of contradictions, blurred lines between reality and performance and self-awareness – “I know how I am, no one else can deal with it, I know that,” she tells Fischer through tears. But as her special hinted at the strains of work, fame and motherhood and then punted to familiar terrain of bodily excess, too often Expecting Amy reels back into what, for Schumer, is familiar, profane terrain: raw, underseen and unsparing, often frankly funny – an on-brand expansion of genre covering for growth left out of the frame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be488fe3677957e92494c9aa57c192b6297322f1/0_344_5175_3106/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f108f2b0ab0e5206f3121d3cc700bfc","title":"halve uk pesticide use to save insects say conservationists","story":"Wildlife Trusts report also calls for expansion of projects such as flower-rich road verges and butterfly reintroductionsThe use of pesticides in the UK must be at least halved to reverse steep losses in insect abundance and boost the natural world that depends on them, according to a report.It warns that insects are the “canaries in the coal mine” of the natural world and that everyone, including the government, local authorities, community groups and iniduals, needs to become insect champions.The report from the Wildlife Trusts presents examples of action already under way, from flower-rich insect superhighways along road verges to pesticide bans in city parks and the reintroduction of long-lost butterflies.“If we get it right for insects we get it right for everything else,” said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex and lead author of the report. “Insects are the canaries in the coal mine: their collapse is an alarm bell that we must not ignore. Action is needed from every section of society.”The UK produced a National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides in 2013 which is now overdue for review. It was described as “woefully weak” by the Pesticides Action Network, as it set no target for reductions.Groups around the UK have been boosting local insect populations, including the On the Verge project in Stirling, which has now worked with more than 100 schools, local councils, churches and care homes to plant new native wildflower areas. Research shows the verge sites have 25 times more flowers and 50 times more bumblebees than adjacent grass areas that were mown.In the London borough of Lambeth the Incredible Edible food project successfully campaigned to end pesticide use. “Our passion is local food, so insects are really important to us,” said Janie Bickersteth, chair of the Lambeth group. “Lambeth has now agreed to go pesticide free by 2021 and has already stopped spraying in all its parks.”The Kent Wildlife Trust and partners have created 146 roadside nature reserves and 13 “bee roads”, which they call insect superhighways and provide forage and refuge for insects. “The landscape in Kent, like much of the UK, has become increasingly fragmented. But our road networks provide a huge opportunity to help address this issue,” said Rosie Bleet, the trust’s bee roads officer.In May, the Manchester argus butterfly was returned to Astley Moss in Greater Manchester for the first time in over 100 years. It was once common across the region, but due to the destruction of its peatland homes, it had become locally extinct.Insect-friendly farming is also highlighted in the report. Jack Kelly, who has 90 acres of mixed farmland in County Down, has used government-funded agri-environment schemes and voluntary work to create a network of flower and seed-rich habitats, with large hedgerows and wetlands. “I’ve always believed that if you look after nature, it will look after you,” he said. “With insect populations plummeting, we must do everything we can to reverse this trend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a24377fe0101da176a97c50584398c52cef0a20/0_102_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3f0559601e1f9c4de1c2713ce17aba02","title":"it looked like something i had already eaten the 15 worst reader bakes of lockdown","story":"Britain underwent a baking revolution while stuck at home – but, from claggy loaves to soggy blobs, the results were not always a successSee readers’ best bakes of lockdownMy daughter bought me a breadmaker but my early attempts were marred by a temperamental electronic scale. At least, that’s my excuse for this monstrosity, which looks more like a 70s Doctor Who villain than a white sandwich loaf. Anna Stanford, PR and communications manager, LondonLike everyone else, I thought I’d give baking bread a go during lockdown – not because bread was scarce, but simply to fill the time and make my flat smell nice. I spotted a recipe for beer bread online that looked super easy and used a can of beer instead of having to do anything fiddly with yeast or starters. But the loaf took on a life (and limb!) of its own – I call it my arm bread. It tasted dreadful. Baking bread is not for me.I joined the sourdough revolution during lockdown after seeing a friend’s amazing loaves. My first loaf, however, was a total brick. The starter wasn’t lively enough but, because I was attending a Zoom online baking class, I had to just crack on. When I started making the dough, it just got stickier and stickier. I felt very disheartened and my second attempt was no better. The dough was still sticky, but I read that you could turn it into focaccia, so I tried that. It was still awful. With too much time on my hands and a recent gift of a huge box of cherries, I thought I’d try making a cherry clafoutis. Despite following the recipe, perhaps with just a couple of improvisations, I ended up with what my niece described as looking like something I had already eaten! Even a sprinkling of icing sugar failed to redeem it, but a dollop of vanilla ice-cream did help it go down.My oven broke at the start of lockdown, leaving me and my flatmate to get creative using the hob for a few weeks. (Fried frozen pizza, anyone?) As soon as it was fixed, I went on a baking spree, which was mostly successful, but with two notable failures: the world’s flattest scones (I blame the recipe) and a funfetti cake. The cake was going well until I added the buttercream icing before it was fully cool. Cue melted pools of butter and soggy blobs of cake. It seemed easy enough: make pistachio bars from scratch, rather than using the packaged bright green pudding. It looks lovely in the photo, especially with the sprinkling of crushed pistachios on top, but instead of the pudding being an appetising shade of green, it best resembled poured concrete (in colour, thankfully not in consistency) sandwiched between two layers of cream cheese. I started baking a couple of months ago as a form of therapymindfulness and have mostly been successful. I usually share my baked goods quite proudly with friends. This time, I waited until the cover of darkness to hand it out – it tasted fine, just looked terrible! A dessert best enjoyed with one’s eyes closed.My sourdough-discard crumpets proved disastrous. I got a bit overconfident having finally figured out how to bake a decent sourdough loaf during lockdown – I even made crumpet rings using beer cans to be mega–sustainable – but it became a squidgy, half-burnt mess. They didn’t taste bad though, all things considered.I was experimenting with vegan baking and decided to try meringues using chickpea water. Covid-19 has made me acutely conscious of food waste and I wanted to make the most of my tin of chickpeas. Sadly, I didn’t whip the aquafaba and sugar for long enough (you need to do it until your arm aches … and then some) so they disintegrated in the oven. It looked like I had microwaved a ghost. This is not my bake, but my fiance’s. I had a lockdown birthday, which was mostly fun, and Tom decided he would make his first-ever cake for the occasion. I checked in on him at one point and warned him not to overbeat the mixture – despite it looking like he might have already done so. Our oven also cooks quite hot … It was meant to be a lemon drizzle loaf and I was obviously effusively grateful, but as cakes go, this was definitely a first attempt. Dense, claggy, burnt. That’s love! I decided to make some cheese scones but they tasted really dusty. It turned out our flour was more than 10 years out of date – and had even moved house with us more than seven years previously.I named my sourdough starter after my late dad, as it produces something nice but crusty. This seemed appropriate. I’ve trawled through recipe books and am now speaking a new language of leavens, levains and autolysing. The kitchen is covered in a fine dusting of flour and my husband has put on a stone. I’ve made one passable loaf and one that was as flat as a pancake. I had one that refused to leave the warm embrace of the floured tea towel and this one, which stuck resolutely to the cooking pot. I’m now on to loaf five and if this one doesn’t work then Dad will have to go in the fridge and lie dormant until I summon up the enthusiasm to bring him back to life.Never a confident cook or baker, I have in recent years – now being a parent to a three-year-old – begun to be more adventurous and bold with my kitchen endeavours. I had been enjoying some moderate success in the muffin department. Suitably encouraged, and bolstered by a recent 3kg delivery of then-rarer-than-gold-dust flour, I set out to bake my first cake from scratch. I measured, I sweated and I watched as it baked words cannot describe the pride I felt when I brought out a perfectly baked cake. Worried that I might damage it in my excitement to put it on the cooling rack, I made the fatal error of giving it to my partner to extract ... who promptly tipped it all over the floor. This is Ruby Tandoh’s seeded loaf, or rather seeded brick. I think I let the second prove go on too long and it collapsed with a disappointed sigh when I slashed it. Definitely my fault, not Ruby’s – her walnut cob has been among my top lockdown bakes. Surprisingly, the brick tastes OK when toasted, so I’ll try again. Like yeast, I rise!I thought making a layered strawberry, raspberry and vanilla cheesecake would be a piece of cake. However, the recipe and instructions differed slightly to my usual recipe and I was torn as to which to follow. I went with the new recipe, but didn’t add gelatine, as I’ve never done this. When I tried the mixture, I could not taste any of the fruit flavours, so (without thinking) I added more fruit. I think it was this that led to my disaster of a slopped cheesecake. The flavour was delicious, but the base was so hard that I couldn’t even pull it off as summer fruit mousse. I will be following my usual recipe next time.I somehow managed to score an enormous bag of flour, so decided to satisfy a serious craving for a proper Devon cream tea.

Here are some creative, storable, freezable ideas to deal with the glut• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theThis is my first year growing broad beans, and I’ve got so many. Any ideas what I can do with them?Liz, NorthamptonshireNothing says summer quite like the unzipping of those fluffy jackets, so this is a nice problem to have, Liz. The good news is that, whatever their age, broad beans always have a use. Chef Henrietta Inman, who cooks and bakes using only natural, locally-sourced ingredients, eats the young pods whole, raw with butter and salt (you could add chopped mint, too), with bagna cauda or a pulse-based dip. That doesn’t automatically mean chickpeas, though: “There are so many other interesting beans and pulses growing in the UK,” she says. Her favourites come from Hodmedods, pioneer of UK-grown pulses, from quinoa to carlin peas, which she soaks, cooks and blends with herbs and olive or rapeseed oil. Cooked broads are reserved for tossing through salads and pasta, or for serving with grilled lamb. Simple, yes, but, as Inman points out, “You don’t want to do too much to them, because they’re tasty as they are.”When pairing broads with other veg, Inman lives by the mantra, “What grows together, goes together”, which, right now, means spinach, chard, mangetout and lettuce. And don’t forget the humble pea, which she blends with broad beans, olive oil, lemon juice and zest, before adding herbs (mint, parsley, thyme) and grated or crumbled English cheese (“something goat- or feta-like”), before shaping into patties and baking. Broads also welcome spice, so fill your boots with cumin, coriander or panch phoran.As for podding, doing the double may seem a faff, but it’s worth the effort. Plus, says Nena Foster, nutritional chef and fermenter, it will keep children entertained, if only for a few minutes. Freezing is perhaps the simplest solution for a glut, with the pods perfect for future veg stock and pre-blanched frozen beans ready for soups and risotto. As Foster says, “They’re such a summery reminder, so it’s nice to have some for when it’s grey again.”For Greg Cazenave of London’s Moxon’s fishmongers, broad beans mean fish stew: “Cuttlefish, tiger or king prawns, squid or monkfish all work really well.” He then adds green and yellow peppers, paprika, cumin or curry powder. Rick and Katie Toogood, from seafood restaurant Prawn on the Lawn, whose Padstow arm is going alfresco next month at nearby Trerethern Farm, meanwhile, mix blitzed cooked beans with potato, crab and chilli, then shape into cakes, fry and serve with coriander-spiked yoghurt. Alternatively, treat beans as you would avocado, they say: “Boil, blitz and mix with salt, pepper and lime juice. Spread on soda bread and top with cooked prawns, chilli and more lime juice.”When your beans have produced their last pod, don’t uproot them, says  gardening columnist Alys Fowler. “If you cut them off at the base, leaving a 5cm stem, and water, it may reshoot,” she says. If it does, soft new growths will appear ready to be cooked: “They have a delicious, broad bean flavour but are leafy.” They’re tops (sorry).• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

They played some scintillating football on a sodden night and could have been out of reach at half‑time, by which point Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang had given them the lead. But a moment of rashness let Leicester back in and suggested that, while the youthful core of this side has learned to fight hard, it is yet to master the art of boxing clever.Eddie Nketiah would have been eager to make an impression upon replacing Alexandre Lacazette, who had taken his starting spot and rewarded Arteta’s judgment with a fine all-round display, in the 71st minute. The manager particularly prizes Nketiah’s hounding of opposition defenders but, with his first significant involvement, he went too far. As the ball bounced towards the Leicester defender James Justin near halfway, Nketiah closed in but his effort to win possession manifested itself in a late, knee-high challenge that looked less edifying with every subsequent VAR replay, making it inevitable that Chris Kavanagh would show a red card. Arteta reacted with anguish on the touchline but, while he was correct in saying Nketiah bore no malice, there were no genuine complaints.Perhaps Nketiah had misjudged the ball’s bounce on a wet night it had certainly reared up at an awkward height. But there had been little need to steam in and, from that moment, Arsenal were on the back foot. Leicester had improved since the break, creating some half-chances and testing the impressive Emiliano Martínez through Kelechi Iheanacho, but Arteta’s side were hardly under siege. That changed after their numbers were reduced and the equaliser, while converted with relative ease by Jamie Vardy at the far post, was a peach. Demarai Gray, showing how constructive a substitute can be, bent an undefendable ball behind Arsenal’s back line from the right and Vardy’s 10th goal in as many starts against this opposition may prove one of his most important.It survived a lengthy VAR check, with eyes at Stockley Park trained on Ayoze Pérez’s attempt to connect before the ball reached Vardy. But Pérez made no contact and did not noticeably disrupt his opponents the decision was correct and ensured Leicester won a point that reduces the alarm around their late-season slump.For a long time it seemed Arsenal were about to set the sirens blaring louder than at any point so far. They would have moved to within six points of Brendan Rodgers’ side with a win, and the bounce a fourth consecutive win would have engendered is incalculable. After a foggy start in which Leicester, missing James Maddison and Ben Chilwell, zipped the ball around and came close when Martínez saved from Iheanacho for the first time, the home side began to find some cohesion and their goal blew the game wide open.It came on the counter, like much of Arsenal’s better early work, and was beautifully conceived. Dani Ceballos, who has played himself into contention for a longer stay in recent weeks, sent Bukayo Saka away on the right with a perfectly weighted pass that the lunging Caglar Soyuncu could not intercept. Saka would have fancied himself one-on-one with Jonny Evans at the outset but his task was made easier when the centre-back stumbled. It meant half of the penalty area was at his disposal and he made good use of the space, laying on a finish for Aubameyang that Vardy would almost exactly replicate later.For the next 25 minutes Arsenal played with more consistent menace than at any point this season. Saka was everywhere, forcing Kasper Schmeichel to save with his legs and then teeing up Lacazette for a shot on the turn that was again repelled. Schmeichel had barely got up when Héctor Bellerín tested him again with a rising cross-shot, while his simplest stop came when Lacazette planted a free header straight into his hands shortly before the interval.David Luiz would bring another sprawling stop from Schmeichel with a second-half free-kick but, by that point, the pendulum had already begun to swing. Vardy twice failed to make good contact while Justin saw a close-range shot blocked Martinez’s handling from Iheanacho’s volley later on was impeccable. Arsenal are no strangers to letting a lead slip but, until Nketiah’s aberration, they looked a good bet to transform their prospects for the final four games.Europa League football now looks likely but another year for Nketiah, Saka, Joe Willock to be polished may be no disaster. “Open your eyes my friend,” Granit Xhaka boomed at the fourth official at one point in the second half. In fact this was compelling watching for everyone and, however the season is resolved, more of that awaits in these parts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c84094aca2ee45dba5907c874e0c7368f17e7eb/0_104_3131_1879/master/3131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe8fcca94e0b2ac6f0a1527273989b9c","title":"crystal palace chelsea premier league match report","story":"This ought to have been rather easier for Chelsea.

When Wilfried Zaha unleashed a firecracker than sizzled through Kepa Arrizabalaga, the under-pressure Chelsea goalkeeper, it was the prompt for a contest to break out – one that Lampard’s team would ultimately edge but only after dicing with disaster.Tammy Abraham, on as a substitute, had made it 3-1 with his first goal since 11 January only for Christian Benteke to respond immediately for Palace. Chelsea had the chances for 4-2, most notably through Abraham, who scuffed a shot when gloriously placed.But Chelsea were in no mood to make life easy for themselves, they appeared addicted to jeopardy and, during five minutes of stoppage-time, they almost paid the price. To Lampard’s frustration, Abraham lost the ball cheaply and, following a Zaha cross, Scott Dann thought he had scored with a towering header.Arrizabalaga, though, got his fingertips to the ball to brush it against the inside of the post and away. There was still time for Palace to threaten again through Benteke only for Kurt Zouma to jump into a saving challenge. The full-time whistle brought elation and relief in equal measure for Lampard. His team remain in the driving seat for a Champions League finish.“Kepa should be boosted by that late save – he saved us two points,” Lampard said. “And it was really important for Tammy to score. He is desperate for goals.” Chelsea’s opener had been fortuitous. When Reece James played a pass forward, the Palace centre-half Gary Cahill was the favourite to get to it ahead of Willian. Then he was not. Cahill felt a stab of pain in his hamstring and slipped down in agony, unable even to watch as Willian streaked away to cut back for Olivier Giroud to finish.Should Willian have kicked the ball out? No. For all he knew, Cahill might only have slipped and how silly would he have looked then? Willian was in full flight and it took only a couple of seconds for him to centre for the goal. In that kind of moment, players are simply not wired to stop.Zouma blew a free header from a corner – a glaring miss – before Chelsea took charge, Willian combining with Giroud to play in Pulisic. The American darted outside Joel Ward and unloaded a vicious shot high into the near corner.With the influential Willian forcing Vicente Guaita into a low save, it was difficult to see a way back for Palace and yet the home team found one. It followed a sloppy turnover by James but when Patrick van Aanholt nudged a deflected ball square, it was all about the ferocious power in Zaha’s right foot.The winger looked angry at how the game was going and he channelled the rage into the shot from 25 yards, a celebration of technique which ripped past Arrizabalaga and into the roof of the net. The goalkeeper appeared to have it within his sights but he could do nothing about it – a bad look for him.The feel of the game changed sharply and Palace finished the first half in the ascendancy, with Zaha pepped and Benteke heading at Arrizabalaga. Chelsea needed another goal and Giroud ought to have scored it early in the second half only to send a free header high from James’s cross because Palace, particularly through Zaha, looked capable of hurting them.What had to worry Lampard was how easily Palace were able to play up to his backline. His midfield did not provide enough protection. Chelsea nerves jangled when Zouma had to block from Jordan Ayew after a poorly defended corner.Lampard introduced Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Abraham and, almost immediately, the former played in the latter to shoot low and in off the far post. The exuberance of this Chelsea team in an attacking sense is easy to love. Yet they switched off when Andreas Christensen was beaten too easily by Van Aanholt and Benteke tapped home. The grandstand finish was on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5eddd70873fa33f45d6936007698b02c5cdb3b/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a917bea446081d34a868a168325e96","title":"european roundup milan juventus lazio lecce serie a","story":"Milan scored three goals in six second-half minutes as they came from behind to stun Juventus, winning 4-2 at San Siro to deny the Serie A leaders the chance to move 10 points clear at the top.After a goalless first half, Adrien Rabiot and Cristiano Ronaldo scored in quick succession early in the second period, giving Juve a 2-0 lead. But the game changed when Milan were awarded a 62nd-minute penalty after a VAR check deemed Leonardo Bonucci guilty of a handball. Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted from the spot, then turned provider for Franck Kessié to equalise four minutes later.Moments after the restart, Rafael Leão raced on to a loose ball after Ante Rebic was brought down, before firing low inside Wojciech Szczesny’s near post to put Milan ahead. Rebic added a fourth 10 minutes from time with a fierce finish from 10 yards to complete a famous comeback and lift Milan into fifth place.The defeat meant Juve failed to capitalise on Lazio’s earlier defeat at lowly Lecce, although Maurizio Sarri’s side remain seven points clear. Their nearest challengers slumped to a 2-1 defeat despite Felipe Caicedo putting them in front after just five minutes.Khouma Babacar headed Lecce level on the half-hour mark and the hosts had the chance to take a first-half lead, only for Marco Mancuso to scoop his penalty over the bar. Early in the second half, Fabio Lucioni headed in from a corner to put Lecce ahead, and they held on to climb out of the relegation zone.The visitors’ best chance to equalise fell to the substitute Bobby Adekanye, whose header from close range was turned over the bar by Gabriel. The Lazio defender Patric was sent off in stoppage time after appearing to bite Giulio Donati on the arm. It was an ugly end to another painful defeat for Lazio – their third in five games since the restart.In La Liga, Atlético Madrid edged towards confirming their Champions League qualification with a 1-1 draw at Celta. Álvaro Morata put Atletico ahead just one minute in but Fran Beltran levelled for the hosts early in the second half.Valencia kept their hopes of European football alive with a 2-1 win over Valladolid, thanks to Lee Kang-in’s 89th-minute winner at the Mestalla."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d3a5515966b58ef505b39bf2d167f8e9852f100/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8da76a7a7b5162d8101ad529ddfacd26","title":"poor nutrition in developing countries is costing firms 850bn annually report","story":"Business is paying a high price for inadequate diets of employees, research shows, with experts calling on companies to provide living wage and subsidised foodMalnutrition among workers in developing countries is costing businesses up to $850bn (£676bn) a year, according to analysis of the hidden impact of poor diet on productivity.Worst affected were industries relying on manual labour, including mining, agriculture and construction, according to a report by Chatham House and the consultancy Vivid Economics. But it found big losses caused by malnutrition in all 13 business sectors studied, including health and education.Productivity losses due to employees underperforming because they are underweight cost companies up to $38bn (£30bn) a year across the 19 countries studied, while losses due to obesity cost up to $27bn (£21bn), researchers found. They scaled up the findings to estimate the cost to all businesses in all low- and middle-income countries.Laura Wellesley, senior research fellow at Chatham House and lead author of the report said: “We’ve known for a long time the impact of malnutrition on society and the huge costs to governments, but the impact on businesses has been overlooked.”“Poor employee nutrition is a significant, but poorly understood challenge for businesses operating in low- and middle-income countries,” said Wellesley. “Undernutrition and obesity are causing big losses across all sectors, and many businesses face a double burden of costs from both obese and undernourished workers.”The report was funded by the Power of Nutrition, a charitable foundation supported by a number of multinational companies including Bayer, Kellogg’s and Unilever. It recommends that companies implement workplace policies on nutrition, such as support for breastfeeding mothers, regular nutritional health checks and the provision of nutritious and subsidised food at work.It also urged that – in addition to tackling malnutrition via social responsibility programmes – companies pay a living wage so that employees can afford good food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f79a9ee4394922f58571d972570b3f1e32e73f58/83_0_3486_2092/master/3486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2764f89be1f50955ab758de05a60bd","title":"running out of energy to deal with this british gas mix up","story":"Final demands and a debt recovery firm sent in, as it insists I live in Glasgow when I’m in HoveI am having a nightmare situation with British Gas that they seem unable to resolve.

I later received a letter from British Gas stating that I owed money for gas and electricity. My surname was misspelled and the debt applied to an address in Glasgow.I have never in my life been to Glasgow. British Gas blamed a computer error and told me the account had been cancelled, but more letters arrived about the same bill. I was again reassured that the account had been cancelled. Then came a red “final demand”.Customer services told me it was a mistake and I should ignore it. I next received a letter from a debt recovery firm. I phoned but my date of birth did not match its records and I was required to send a copy of my passport. By now over four months had passed.I contacted British Gas again and was assured that the issue would be resolved, but I’ve since received another letter from the debt recovery agent saying that British Gas has confirmed I owe the money and requiring evidence I don’t live in Glasgow.I have sent my council tax bill for the period in question to prove this.

She talks about her fight to remain – and strengthening her rootsDuring lockdown, UK jazz artist Bumi Thomas has found space to spread out in her local park. “I take my guitar and howl,” she laughs. “I love it!” As the world starts to understand just how much black women feel they have to reduce themselves, it’s soothing to think of a carefree Thomas filling public space with highlife and jazz melodies.She tells me about a Peter Adjaye livestream she’s been dancing to and speaks with what she calls a “transatlantic twang”, a blend of a Hausa accent from her years living in Nigeria, the place of her parents’ birth a distinct international-school American lilt and strands of Glasgow and London. Then there is the influence of Yoruba, “a very deep and brooding language that comes from a different part of your mouth and body,” she says. “I learned it later in life singing Fela Kuti songs. And there’s a connection to the blues I grew up singing, like Miles Davis and Muddy Waters.”Last year, Thomas was preparing to bring that rich voice to bear in a performance in LA with the Moroccan visual artist Hassan Hajjaj. The next day, she woke up to a letter and felt the earth give way. Thomas was born in Glasgow in June 1983 after the British Nationality Act was passed by the Thatcher government in January that year it stated that children born to parents from the colonies were no longer entitled to automatic citizenship. The letter informed Thomas – who has lived in the UK solidly since she was 17 – that she had 14 days to leave the country or make herself subject for deportation or detainment.“I couldn’t believe what I was reading” she says. “I felt nauseous. I sat down everything was spinning. It was terrifying. There’s a section at the end that says: you do not have the right to work, you do not have the right to rent property, your bank account can be frozen. It’s like someone is suffocating you.” LA was off she started making calls. “I picked up the phone and heard myself telling people, ‘I just got my refusal.’”Thomas was one of thousands of people with roots in former colonies, including the Windrush generation, who were made suddenly precarious thanks to a renewed “hostile environment” policy. She had, like many others, assumed she was a British citizen with dual nationality – the 1983 change “was not well communicated to the public in the UK or in the colonies”. After all, her sister, born in the same circumstances but before 1983, was British.Community activists crowdfunded Thomas’s legal fees, created a petition that drew 25,000 signatures, and alerted the media. An immigration tribunal judge ruled in favour of withdrawing the threat of deportation, but she must wait two years before she can apply for British citizenship. Her status is still at the mercy of a isive immigration policy.During this period of statelessness, somehow, Thomas was writing songs. They ended up on Broken Silence, her gloriously joyful jazz EP, out last month. On it, she defines herself not by the language of the British state but in the power of ancestral sounds across the African continent and beyond. She describes the devotional-sounding udu drum that appears on Black Child with reverence: “A vessel used by Igbo women to fetch water from a stream, and based on the amount of water in it, it has this fantastic bass sound and you can tune it to different tones.”The hostility of the Home Office renewed an urge to root herself in her own history. In the early 70s, Thomas’s parents owned a hair salon in Glasgow called Hairlynks, the site of significant black music history that attracted artists and creatives, and saw a young Sade singing there, according to the memory archives of locals. “Before that, if you were in the Highlands, you’d have to go to London to get your hair done,” Thomas laughs. Through the shop’s sound system, the young Thomas took in the rhythms of a black artistic community through the braids and chatter.Further back, she discovered her father’s Afro-Brazilian roots dating back to the 19th century, and the musical hangover of Nigeria’s historical Portuguese occupation. On Lesso Lesso, she pays homage to this, singing in Portuguese, English and Yoruba, featuring a sample from her dad sent over WhatsApp voice notes. The loose translation of his Yoruba instructs her: be careful with your heart, go gently, gently.Gently advocating for black joy feels radical in a world often unsympathetic to global black trauma. For Thomas, this moment of mobilisation chimes with her own personal battle with a system that has uprooted her sense of home.“At times, the music feels likes protest,” she sighs. “When I sang before, it had meaning, but not the same resonance. I went to a Black Lives Matter protest a few weeks ago and someone had a boombox and played A Change Is Gonna Come. It is all … emotional.”She takes a breath. “I’ve been feeling so much. You are forced to choose to shrink or expand yourself.” For now, she chooses expansion: taking her guitar to the park, singing songs that cross borders, restricted by nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service.

From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions.

In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate.

According to reports, he will announce an immediate stamp duty holiday for homes at the lower end of the market, and cuts to VAT are also reportedly under consideration. The chancellor said: “Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic.“We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation. So we’ve got a bold plan to protect, support and create jobs – a Plan for Jobs.”People under 25 receive a lower national minimum wage, starting at £4.55 an hour for someone under 18, rising to £6.45 an hour for 18 to 20-year-olds and £8.20 an hour for 21 to 24-year-olds. The scheme is mainly aimed at people aged 18 and above because most 16 and 17-year-olds are in education or apprenticeships.The chancellor’s proposal received a cautious welcome from UK trade union body the TUC. Its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Unions have been pushing hard for a jobs guarantee for young workers who lose their jobs during this crisis.“The chancellor has made a good first step. But we’ll be checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment.“Employers must do the right thing. They should work with unions to avoid job displacement, create good opportunities for all young workers and guarantee they are paid at least the real living wage.“We must do all we can to avoid the misery of mass unemployment. The government should bring business and unions together in a national recovery council so working people are not made to pay the price of this crisis and ensure we build back better, right across the country.”In the first two months of the Covid-19 crisis the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming universal credit rose by a quarter of a million to almost 500,000, while 700,000 school leavers and university graduates will enter a depressed jobs market this summer.The Treasury said the subsidised jobs would give young people the opportunity to build their skills in the workplace, and to gain experience that will improve their chances of going on to find long-term sustainable work. Sunak is also expected to announce a £111m investment to triple the scale of traineeships in 2020-21, and an extra £32m for the National Careers Service.Kathleen Henehan, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “It is very welcome that the government has opted for a bold and ambitious scheme, with £2bn potentially meaning jobs for around 350,000 young people. This is exactly the kind of approach needed, learning the lessons of what worked in the financial crisis.“History also shows that it is crucial that these jobs are created quickly, with local authorities crucial in making that happen at anything like the scale the government intends. Three hundred and fifty thousand new jobs would be three times as many as were created under the Future Jobs Fund following the financial crisis, so delivery on this scale will be a huge challenge.”The chancellor rebuffed calls from Labour to leave the scheme in place for the hardest-hit industries, saying it would remain a nationwide “general subsidy” and would be scaled back next month before closing in October as previously announced.He also resisted pressure to offer extra help to the 1 million self-employed workers who miss out on all of the government’s subsidy schemes. “In terms of the design and the duration with which it lasts, the breadth of its coverage and the generosity of its support, it remains the most generous self-employment support scheme in the world,” he said.Conservative backbenchers have largely welcomed the government’s big-spending approach to tackling the Covid-19 downturn, though some traditionalists are beginning to sound the alarm.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the veteran Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “Can we hear from the chancellor and the prime minister less about high-spending lefties like President Roosevelt and more about good Conservatives like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – less about subsidies and more about tax cuts and tax simplification?”Johnson appeared to hint last week that taxes could rise to pay for his spending plans, but he told the Yorkshire Post on Monday he has not abandoned a manifesto pledge not to raise the rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT. Other measures expected to be announced by the chancellor on Wednesday include a £3bn plan to green the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17154d82df917e93708c6e705074100ece2f620/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9352723113c1fbdd76d07c96e8afb41a","title":"my online business flourished the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut down","story":"Kaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

For 40 years, at the Shaftesbury theatre in London’s West End, Harry Gabriel has stepped through the door most nights at 5.30pm. As the evening stage-door keeper, his job involves making sure that those who should get backstage do while those who shouldn’t can’t.On 16 March, at around 7pm, Gabriel could hear the cast of the musical \u0026amp Juliet warming up on stage, when it was announced that the building was closing as a precaution against Covid-19.Since then, the 83-year-old Gabriel has been “shielding” while furloughed from his job. To his great sadness, he can’t go to the theatre – but the theatre is coming to him on 15 July, as many of those he has welcomed to the Shaftesbury, including Judi Dench, Eddie Izzard and Sharon D Clarke, will take part in Hello Harry!, a 40th-anniversary tribute concert, raising money for causes including Black Lives Matter and Cancer Research.The job of a stage-door keeper, Gabriel says, “is to welcome staff and visitors, and attend to their needs. Stage door is the contact between every department.” Is his own costume important? “That is a personal choice. But one of my biggest passions apart from theatre is clothes. So I like to wear beautiful things.” For premieres, he puts on black tie, in the old theatrical tradition. “I love first nights – the friends and fans bringing gifts and drinks to the stage door. And then the party afterwards!”The main business is gatekeeping. For much of his tenure, people signed in and out in a ledger using a Biro on a piece of string. But, latterly, members of a production team were admitted by a thumb recognition system, which registers their presence or absence in the building.New technology was one way that the workplace changed after the September 11 attacks in New York and 7 July terrorism attacks in London. Until then, it was left to Gabriel to decide whether visitors or packages for actors should be let in. But, subsequently, there were “cameras everywhere and extra security”.Stage-door keepers at The Mousetrap, Les Misérables or The Phantom of the Opera could have worked for several decades on the same show, but Gabriel’s time at the Shaftesbury has encompassed dozens of productions. “Yes, it’s suited me well to look after so many new and different shows. That’s why it’s been 40 happy years.”His first production, in 1980, was They’re Playing Our Song, a Neil Simon-Marvin Hamlisch musical starring Tom Conti and Gemma Craven. Subsequent highlights included a series of concerts at the Shaftesbury by Eartha Kitt, and appearances first in Pygmalion and then in Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell by Peter O’Toole, a favourite of those who passed his way.O’Toole was often seen as a laidback type of actor but the door-side perspective gives an intriguing insight into his pre-show routine. “He would do anything for the people waiting at the stage door – talk to them, chat to them, pose for pictures, sign photographs. But, then, when he got into the building, it was total concentration. The only people he would speak to before a show were me and his dresser.”Theatrical anecdote suggests that stage-door keepers witness extraordinary displays of egotism, vanity and anger. But Gabriel insists that the actors who have worked at the Shaftesbury since 1980 have all been “without exception kind and lovely human beings”, although, looking at the list, some of them must have made a rare exception for him.He watches each new production during rehearsals or at matinees. “Every show has a meaning for me – the story, the music, the costumes, something. There’s something special in every production.” That includes Out of the Blue, an Anglo-Japanese musical about the atom bombing of Nagasaki, which closed within two weeks, after brutal reviews, in 1994. “The theme of that musical – which was anti-war – meant a great deal to me. I loved it but I think it opened at a time when there was a lot of controversy in Britain about Japanese treatment of prisoners of war.”When the building has a flop – another was the musical From Here to Eternity – he is strongly aware that the people coming in to work are about to lose their jobs. “That is a sad thing in theatre. Especially the ones who are not in demand, who won’t walk into another show. My job is to cheer them up. The same if they come in and something has gone wrong at home.”For most of his time at the Shaftesbury, he didn’t have a favourite show. But, since 2016, it’s Motown: The Musical – because its three-and-a-half-year run was the longest of his tenure, and the African American cultural history it depicts has such resonance for him.It was through the anti-racist movement of the 80s – “Just as now we have Black Lives Matter, then it was anti-apartheid” – that Gabriel first got involved in theatre. A friend in the campaign against racial segregation in South Africa got him work at London’s Astoria theatre (“Which has gone now, for the Crossrail”), during a residency by the American basketball team, the Harlem Globetrotters. The Astoria’s owner also controlled the Shaftesbury and “without a lot of ceremony” Gabriel was offered the stage-door post there.Before finding his theatrical vocation, he worked in a variety of administrative roles, including at the National Centre for Children and Families in north London. He describes its founder, the psychoanalyst Anna Freud, as “one of the best people ever on this planet”.All British theatres look haunted now, but, for centuries, most were reputed to harbour ghosts. Has Gabriel ever seen one? “Well, they say that every theatre has ghosts. But, personally, I don’t believe in them. So I am one of the very few never to have seen one at the Shaftesbury theatre.”During his furloughed period, “the theatre gets in touch with us every week to tell us the latest and cheer us up.” His tentative hope is that the Shaftesbury and other venues might reopen towards the end of the year, although it may not yet have been judged safe for the currently shielding Gabriel to return by then. “I understand that,” he says, but he shines brightly when he looks back at the “40 amazing years” that will be celebrated next week.• Hello Harry! will be streamed on 15 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

Now the British director is working on Mrs America, which stars Cate Blanchett as an infamous anti-feminist. But that’s not who’s caught Asante’s eyeIt’s difficult for Amma Asante to assess how far she’s come, because she just doesn’t have the relevant role models. “I haven’t had the example,” says the director, “of someone who is both black, British and female to look to, in terms of the career I’d like to have. It’s thwarted my sense of expectation.”Still, in the decade between making her first film, 2004’s Bafta-winning A Way of Life, and her second, the 18th-century-set drama Belle, Asante became increasingly aware of male counterparts getting more chances, being more likely to be award-nominated, and consequently getting even more opportunities and even bigger budgets.“All of that has an impact on how your career develops,” she says, “but I made a promise to myself to try to catch up – and made three films in five years. Which was exhausting.” This was the period of A United Kingdom, starring David Oyelowo as the real-life first president of Botswana, and second world war teen romance Where Hands Touch. More recently, she made the move into US television, directing episodes of The Handmaid’s Tale. And then there’s Mrs America, the miniseries about to launch on BBC Two.Mrs America stars Cate Blanchett as Phyllis Schlafly, the avowed anti-feminist who led a campaign in the 1970s to block the Equal Rights Amendment. But what might have been a straightforward biopic of Schlafly has been expanded into a wider and richer story about other women from the era, representing a broad spectrum of views and experiences.Take Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to be elected to Congress, and a candidate for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. “Her courage and vision were unparalleled,” says Asante, who seized at the chance to fully credit this lesser known figure, signing up for the episode focused on Chisholm, who is played by Uzo Aduba. “On the face of it, Chisholm failed. But without her, I don’t think there could have been an Obama. I don’t think Hillary Clinton could have thought about running.”Early episodes have a fixed camerawork style for Schlafly’s scenes, which contrast with the hand-held style used for the likes of Gloria Steinem, played by Rose Byrne. Politically, Chisholm would fit in the Steinem camp, but Asante chose not to take the looser approach. “She was at once very traditional – the way she dressed was like Thatcher – while at the same time she was pushing us to evolve. I wanted a combination of styles for her. It’s really important that, as people of colour, we can be many things at once, like any other person.”Chisholm is finally being honoured with a monument, due to be installed in Brooklyn by the end of the year. She’s just one of a huge cast of equally nuanced characters: Asante also directs the episode focusing on Betty Friedan, the mother of second wave feminism, played by Tracey Ullman. The show not only has the scope of The Wire, the period detail of Mad Men, and the power-brokering of The West Wing, it also manages to feel very relevant to the Black Lives Matter movement and progressive politics in general. Asante didn’t balk at the challenge, though, perhaps because her films – mostly period dramas exploring race, class and gender – have been such a strong preparation.Her next, The Billion Dollar Spy, tells the true story of Soviet-born CIA informant Adolf Tolkachev. This might seem a departure, she says, “in the sense that it’s two white men – not that I haven’t directed white men before”. But, actually, it’s a continuation of underlying themes: “A United Kingdom is about what happens when you love your country but you don’t love the people running it, in that case the empire. And this is about what happens when you love your country but not the people running it, and they come from the same place.”The interplay of factors that lead people to believe what they believe and do what they do is what interests Asante. It’s also what keeps drawing her to the past: “History for me is the parent of society. We don’t necessarily have to think everything they did was right, but we find ways to move forward from who they were.”She mentions the star of Belle: “Gugu Mbatha-Raw said to me the other day, ‘Really? You really don’t think you’re an activist?’ One thing I will say is I’m grateful for the work feminists have done and I’m really, really grateful for Shirley Chisholm. I’ve no doubt I’m able to stand on an American set today because she existed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ffed01a3d3595ecd30dddeb888b96084971cc5/0_46_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a6e3574893b8a722eb494df8008452","title":"china christopher wray operation fox hunt","story":"Christopher Wray condemns campaign against ex-pats and says Beijing espionage is ‘greatest threat to US economic vitality’Chinese agents have been pursuing hundreds of Chinese nationals living in the US in an effort to force their return, as part of a global campaign against the country’s diaspora, known as Operation Fox Hunt, the FBI director has said.In a speech about the security threat posed by China, during which he said Beijing’s counterintelligence work was “greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality”, Christopher Wray gave the example of one Fox Hunt target who was given a choice of going back to China or killing themselves.Fox Hunt was launched six years ago by President Xi Jinping, ostensibly to pursue corrupt officials and business executives who had fled abroad. Beijing has celebrated its claimed successes, publicising the return of hundreds of economic fugitives, and issuing wanted lists of those still at large. The Obama administration complained about the activities of undercover agents in 2015.Wray said the operation’s principal aim now was to suppress dissent among the diaspora.He told the Hudson Institute in Washington: “China describes Fox Hunt as some kind of international anti-corruption campaign. It is not. Instead, Fox Hunt is a sweeping bid by Xi to target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside of China, across the world.“We’re talking about political rivals, dissidents and critics seeking to expose China’s extensive human rights violations.”The FBI director said: “Hundreds of these Fox Hunt victims that they target live right here in the United States, and many are American citizens or green card holders. The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China’s tactics to accomplish that are shocking.“For example, when it couldn’t locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target’s family here in the US. The message they said to pass on: the target had two options, returned to China promptly or commit suicide.”Wray said that Fox Hunt operations, directed by China’s ministry of public security, were also under way in other countries, and the FBI had been cooperating with its partners to foil Chinese efforts at intimidation. He said Chinese nationals in the US were often coerced by thinly veiled threats against their families back in China.Asked about other coercive tactics used, he replied: “Use your imagination. You’re not going to be far off.”He appealed to anyone in the US who thought they were a Fox Hunt target to “please reach out to your local FBI field office”.Wray portrayed China as an aggressive rival with little or no regard for international or national laws. He said that nearly half the FBI’s 5,000 active counter-intelligence cases were China-related.“We’ve now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,” he said. “Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China.”China was using leverage, pressure or persuasion through intermediaries on federal, state and local officials, as well as US corporations and media, to win support for Chinese foreign policy positions. Wray said such efforts had been stepped up during the coronavirus outbreak, aimed at generating praise for Beijing’s handling of the pandemic.Although he did not say whether China backed either Donald Trump or his presumptive Democratic rival, Joe Biden, he claimed China was pushing its preferences for the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.“China’s malign foreign influence campaign targets our policies, our positions, 247, 365 days a year,” Wray said. “So it’s not an election-specific threat it’s really more of an all-year, all-the-time threat. But certainly that has implications for elections and they certainly have preferences that go along with that.”The FBI director said that China was also involved in mass hacking, identity theft and intellectual property espionage, and there are 1,000 investigations into “China’s actual and attempted theft of technology” in all the bureau’s 56 field offices.“The people of the United States are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history,” Wray said.He said China was “engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world’s only superpower by any means necessary”. “The stakes could not be higher.”In an interview on Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US was considering banning the social media platform TikTok and other Chinese-made apps.India banned TikTok and over 50 other Chinese apps last week, in the wake of clashes on the China-India border in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.“We’re certainly looking at it,” Pompeo told Fox News. “With respect to Chinese apps on people’s cellphones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right. I don’t want to get out in front of the president, but it’s something we’re looking at.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bdb06e9303b745b67aa70ba26ce32d3ccaad72/0_222_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c62587159409ae7172f88349ecd5025b","title":"bus carrying students due to sit exam plunges into lake in china","story":"Footage shows vehicle veering into oncoming traffic before crashing through barrierAt least 21 people have been killed after a bus carrying students preparing to sit their university entrance exam plunged into a lake in south-west China.The bus crashed into a guard rail and veered into Hongshan Lake in Guizhou province, leaving 15 others injured, the local emergency management department said.The incident took place around noon in the city of Anshun and witnesses said the passengers on the bus included students who were due to sit their higher education entrance exams that day, known as “gaokao”, the state broadcaster CCTV reported.Security camera footage shared on social media by the broadcaster showed the vehicle veering across at least five lanes and cutting into oncoming traffic before it ploughed through barriers on the other side of the road.Images from the scene showed search and rescue teams at the lake and the bus being fished out of the water in the hours after the crash.Guizhou’s emergency management department said more than 200 people helped with rescue efforts, including 55 professional ers.Social media users expressed their condolences on China’s microblogging platform Weibo. “I hope the death toll will not rise anymore. 2020 has truly been full of disasters and difficulties,” one user wrote.All those injured in the crash are being treated in hospital.

The chancellor will also announce a £3bn programme to make homes and public buildings more environmentally friendly and, according to reports, an immediate stamp duty holiday for homes at the lower end of the market. Cuts to VAT are also reportedly under consideration.Health risks to women written off – Serious medical complications being dismissed as “women’s problems” contributed to a string of healthcare scandals over several decades, an inquiry ordered by the government has found. The review of vaginal mesh, hormonal pregnancy tests and anti-epilepsy medicine that harmed unborn babies paints a damning picture of a medical establishment that failed to acknowledge problems even in the face of mounting safety concerns, leading to avoidable harm to patients. Instead, women routinely had symptoms attributed to psychological issues or it being “that time of life”. The report’s wide-ranging recommendations include appointing an independent patient safety commissioner, an overhaul of the healthcare products regulatory agency and the expansion of the General Medical Council register to include a list of financial interests for all doctors.Clamp for carers – Free parking for NHS staff at hospitals will end, the government has announced, casting further doubt on its priorities in handling the coronavirus crisis. An outcry against the decision is being led by the British Medical Association, which has said it represents a “a rebuff to the immense efforts of staff across the country and the sacrifices they have made to keep others safe”.Our global coronavirus live blog is covering updates as they transpire: here are some of the latest developments. The WHO has acknowledged new evidence that the coronavirus spreads more widely in the air than it had previously suggested. Doctors may be missing signs of serious and potentially fatal brain disorders triggered by Covid-19, neurologists have warned. Today they publish details of more than 40 UK patients who have suffered complications ranging from brain inflammation and delirium to nerve damage and stroke – in some cases the problem was their first and main symptom. The cases reveal a rise in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Adem). One woman aged 59 died of the complication.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has pointed to the US in warning against trying to do “everything at the same time” in getting daily life back to normal. “We see that in many states in America right now, a spiralling out of control. We mess with this virus at our peril.” The Trump administration has notified the WHO it will cancel its membership from May 2021 – a decision Joe Biden says he will reverse if he wins this November’s election. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, perhaps the world’s foremost naysayer regarding the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, has confirmed his own illness with the virus.‘Return or kill yourself’ – China is blackmailing dissenters in the US to come home and hand themselves in by using threats against family members and other means, the FBI chief says. The covert campaign is known as Operation Fox Hunt. Christopher Wray said in a speech that Beijing’s counterintelligence work poses the “greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property and to our economic vitality”. He said Fox Hunt began ostensibly as a campaign to bring to justice corrupt officials and business executives who had fled overseas, but had turned into a sinister programme to suppress dissent and criticism of President Xi Jinping among the Chinese diaspora.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMore than 720,000 people have signed up for the new Covid tracker app aimed at helping to identify close contacts of people who test positive for Covid-19.The app, launched on Tuesday by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, has so far been taken up by 15 per cent of the population and 23 per cent of all those over 16 years with smartphones, a Health Service Executive spokesman said.While data on the download performance of apps on their debut is not publicly available, Australia’s CovidSafe app racked up two million downloads in its first 24 hours – equivalent to about 8 per cent of the population. And in Britain, the self-reporting app for those with symptoms of the virus had 750,000 downloads in its first 24 hours.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said use of the app in Ireland could see a reduction in the time required to trace close contacts of someone who tested positive from days to hours.He also said the app cost about €850,000 to develop with an annual running cost of €350,000-€400,000.ConcernsMeanwhile, concerns have been raised with the State’s public-health team that a significant number of iniduals who may have encountered people with Covid-19 are not engaging with the contact-tracing process.At a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) last month, officials were told that despite multiple attempts over a period of days to phone or text the close contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases, a proportion are not engaging with the system.“The NPHET was advised that a proportion of the people who are identified as close contacts of confirmed cases do not complete the full contract-tracing process,” minutes of the meeting state.The HSE said its contact management programme takes “an active approach” and makes “multiple attempts to contact the close contacts over multiple days”.“This includes text messages, phone calls, and leaving voicemails however, it is not always possible to make contact with these iniduals.”The HSE also said it would undertake a further analysis looking at the number of close contacts identified per case and the proportion of those who are contacted and then tested for a first and second time. The HSE also said it would examine international experience around how to improve contact tracing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"T\u0026aacutenaiste introduces Bill after Microfinance Ireland suspends fundingTwo alleged offences against woman, who is also a garda, date back almost a decadeIHREC report published as Covid-19 highlights \u0026lsquoexisting inequalities in our society\u0026rsquoLive online classes more likely in private schools, finds Trinity College Dublin studyAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductionsAmerican woman went missing in Ireland 27 years agoCurrent leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin make the pledge during hustings for leadership contestGovernment will do what it can on statutory redundancy for ex-employees, says TaoiseachLee Rogers (27) had captained football team in cup tie after telling doctor of injuries, court toldDaryl Coyle (30) subjected Magdi Mustafa Rashid to a \u0026lsquoterrifying\u0026rsquo assault, court toldAny app introduced in the North will be compatible with that in the Republic, minister has saidAssembly calls on North\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister and Finance Minister to apologise for their actionsElectrician Stephen Mills (24) had been sitting in the back seat when the accident happenedMartin quizzed on adviser costs and expense of 20 Ministers of State in new GovernmentMinister for Health says app is not a \u0026lsquosilver bullet\u0026rsquo but an important new tool in the fight against Covid-19Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298347.1594162638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry cowen tells d%C3%A1il he is profoundly sorry for stupid drink driving offence","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen made a personal statement in the Dáil on Tuesday night. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has told the Dáil he is profoundly sorry for a drink-driving offence in 2016.He said his decision to drive while over the limit and on a provisional driving permit was a stupid mistake and he had apologised to road safety groups and campaigners.He said the drink driving offence on the way home from an All-Ireland football final on September 18th, 2016 was the one and only time he had driven while over the limit.“Before the match I consumed two drinks and following the game had a light meal before driving home to Offaly. On the way to drop my friend home I was stopped by gardaí and asked to participate in a breathalyser test. I did so, and both this test and a subsequent test at a local Garda station confirmed that I was over the legal alcohol limit,” he said.At the time he held a learner driver permit and the penalty was a €200 fine and a three month driving ban.“I subsequently secured and now hold a full clean driving licence,” he said.“My decision in September 2016 to drive home after consuming any alcohol was a stupid stupid mistake. It never happened before the 18th of September 2016 and it has never happened since. It was a mistake for which I am profoundly sorry,” he added.He had examined his records and the only other offence for which he had paid a fine that had not already been reported by media was for failing to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago.Mr Cowen told the Dáil it was not uncommon to drive on a learner permit before reforms of the driver licensing system but it was bad practice and he should have regularised his position sooner.He said other offences including parking fines should not be conflated with the totally different issue of drink driving.AloneThe Minister who sat alone on the Government benches said in his personal statement to the House that the emergence of the issue had put an intense spotlight on him and on “more importantly, the shame of drink driving”.He said the criticism he had attracted for a serious lapse of judgment was fully deserved. “This grave error and my subsequent humiliation will hopefully serve to highlight the terrible dangers and consequences of drink driving.”Mr Cowen said he spoke earlier on Tuesday to Susan Gray of Parc road safety group and Donna Price of the Irish Road Safety Association and apologised to them. He said he had also apologised to his family, the Taoiseach, the Government, his constituents and the public.Mr Cowen referred to “some speculation about how someone my age could be driving on either a learner permit or provisional licence”.He said the fact is that before the recent reforms of the system it was “not uncommon for people of all ages and levels of experience to either be on a provisional or learner permit. However this was bad practice and I clearly should have regularised my position sooner.”He said that after a full examination of all his records “the only additional event that I have been able to identify, not reported this morning was a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago for which I paid a fine”.Mr Cowen said he would “now invest my full energy and full focus on the responsibilities I have been given as a TD and a Minister”.‘So disappointed’Susan Gray of Parc, said afterwards that Mr Cowen had left “so many unanswered” questions.She said he rang her on Tuesday morning and she put several questions to him. “He assured me he would answer as many as he could tonight during his statement. It just beggars belief that that man has ignored the huge elephant in the room here. Where he was driving on a learner permit for years and years, he has admitted he drove unaccompanied ... he was done for speeding, he took it to court ... we asked him did the penalty points get applied to his licence. We know that a learner driver after receiving seven penalty points is automatically disqualified,” she told RTÉ’s Prime Time.“We just can’t believe he didn’t answer any of them questions,” she added.She said she asked Mr Cowen on Tuesday morning when did he get his full licence. “He said a few years ago, he couldn’t give me the date. I told him it would be on his driving licence ... he didn’t have it on him”.She asked if he displayed N plates as a provisional permit holder. “There are so many unanswered questions that we will be issuing a statement tomorrow on what we decide is the best way forward,” she said.QuestionsEarlier an opposition attempt to force Mr Cowen to answer questions after his Dáil statement about his drink driving ban was defeated.Mr Cowen made his statement at 9pm on Tuesday.Labour and a number of Independent TDs supported Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party in the 30 to 14 vote which prevented a change to the order of business.Rise TD Paul Murphy said it was not acceptable and “problematic” that Mr Cowen would give a statement without answering questions.The Dublin South-West TD said there were “numerous questions” outstanding about the offence, Mr Cowen’s licence and whether he was breaching the law repeatedly in relation to learner plates and being accompanied by a fully licensed driver.He added that it was the “first test of the Government and whether they’re going to establish a precedent” by using their majority to prevent questions to a Minster involved in controversy.Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghail said Mr Cowen had made a request for speaking time to make a personal statement under Standing Order 56 which did not allow for debate.Independent TD Mattie McGrath said no request had been made at the business committee about the issue and he accused Mr Murphy of “showboating and shenanigans”.‘Cute hoor’Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected opposition suggestions that Fianna Fáil is back to “old style cute hoor kind of politics”.Labour leader Alan Kelly made the claim in the Dáil as he highlighted controversies that erupted in the party’s first week back in office.He raised the issue during Mr Martin’s first leaders’ questions in the Dáil as Taoiseach.But Mr Martin stressed that he had been focused on “policy and substance”. He said that “other stuff goes on as it always has in politics and we will deal with that too”.Mr Kelly said that Mr Martin had had the “shortest honeymoon in history” of just two hours before internal party criticism began.He told the Taoiseach: “One of your Ministers has had to apologise quite publicly for his driving ban while on a provisional licence,” in reference to controversy over Mr Cowen and the drink driving offence.Mr Kelly added that it was “in the same week your Minister for health has stood over an interview where he admitted taking illegal drugs.”And “then one of your MEPs ignored the requirement for quarantine” when he returned from Brussels to attend the Dáil sitting in the Convention Centre.The Tipperary TD asked: “Are Fianna Fail public representatives above the law and above public health advice?”He said the Government’s first week had not been a good week and “the modus operandi looks like it’s back to old style cute hoor kind of politics”.He also hit out at Sinn Féin’s leadership over the controversy about breaking social distancing rules attending two funerals in the North when other families stayed home when their own relatives and friends were buried.The practice of “exceptionalism” might be expected from Sinn Féin but many thought Fianna Fail had been “humbled” by the recession.He also criticised the first act of the Minister for Education which he said “was to bellow about a new grant to a school in her own constituency”, during the biggest education crisis to face the State.PunishmentThe country needed a stable Government during the biggest crisis to face the State and people were concerned about housing, health, rents, mortgage arrears and returning to work.Mr Martin however told Mr Kelly he rejected “your analysis of the first week in Government” and said his focus has been on “policy and substance”.He said there was an unprecedented amount of legislation they would try to get through in this Government and he had had talks with senior EU officials including the president of the European Commission and British prime minister Boris Johnson.The Taoiseach said “I haven’t wasted an hour” in dealing with policy.He said “no politicians should be above the law and no politician is above the law”.Mr Martin added that punishment “was meted out” to Mr Cowen and he would address the issue in a statement later in the Dáil on Tuesday night.He stressed the focus on education and not depriving children any longer of schooling and education. He said they would deal with travel and quarantines and they would focus on education and “engaging with the education authorities in terms of returning to school”, and on the return of health services."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298742.1594158946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord minister for agriculture tries to get himself out of the manure","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture  Barry Cowen:  was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself. Photograph: PAIn an explosive debut, the new Dáil burst from the Leinster House blocks on Tuesday.The coalition’s first day in full session after Government formation brought with it the first abject apology from a Government Minister. That’s quite the start.And it came after a litany of embarrassing episodes for new Taoiseach Micheál Martin, busily concentrating on getting his administration up and running while his party colleagues busily concentrate on covering themselves in ignominy.Although his new Minister for Agriculture can’t be accused of not getting stuck in immediately. Barry Cowen is barely a wet week in his job and already he’s up to his oxters in manure. BabyBiff, brother of a former taoiseach Brian Cowen, was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself.It was a deep, deep apology for a drink-driving offence committed four years ago (and saying nothing to his party leader about it) and getting a fine and a three-month ban. As it was at the lowest end of the scale, there was no requirement to go to court at the time.Full apologySo Cowen came into the chamber at 9pm and devoted his six-minute speaking slot to a full apology for his “grave error” and “lapse of judgment” and “stupid, stupid mistake”. There were no questions taken on his “misdemeanour”.While taking full responsibility for his one and only lapse into “the shame of drink-driving” and apologising all round him, he made no attempt to make excuses his action or minimise the gravity of the offence. But his carefully worded statement also referred to how reports on the original incident have now “extended to reporting various speeding and parking fines I have occurred over the years”.Many TDs would have collected similar penalties he intimated and he was clearly unhappy with these issues being “conflated” with the altogether different matter of drink-driving.“I have conducted a full examination of all records that I could obtain,” he informed the Dáil. After dredging though his motoring past he disclosed “a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago”.Cowen wants to get on with his job. “Now, formally, on the record of this House I sincerely want to apologise to my peers and my colleagues.”In the meantime, he has been very busy. Almost as busy as his boss who earlier told the House that he hasn’t “wasted an hour” since becoming Taoiseach.Cowen detailed all he has done since getting the new job in agriculture, before the premature onset of the manure. He has had made himself aware of the threat of Brexit, acquainted himself with the parlous state of the timber industry and already had the chats with commissioner Phil Hogan and his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots.You’d be worried letting Barry near a car after those conversations which would drive anyone to drink.A day when an attempt at a groundbreaking form of blended learning has entered its second week in Kildare Street. Early results are chaotic but largely inconclusive.It involves Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running a government together for the first time, with a large handful of Greens thrown in for leavening purposes. Whatever way the experiment turns out, it’s shaping up to be very entertaining. Sorry, educational.How will they get on? Hard to credit, but Tuesday’s sitting was the first with all the bells and whistles since the general election was called back in February.It was a huge occasion for Martin, who turned up in the chamber almost 10 minutes early for his first round of Leaders’ Questions as Taoiseach. The Fianna Fáil leader had already waited 31 years so an extra few minutes to savour the moment wasn’t going to make much difference.Oh, but Micheál was anxious to get his posterior into that coveted top seat, making a swift beeline towards it as soon as he got through the doors. He swerved to take the shortest route, only to be deftly erted by ushers onto the time-honoured walkway all around the top level of the circular chamber, and from thence down the stairs which end where he sits.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, in her elevated capacity as leader of the biggest Opposition party, took up position across the floor in the place recently vacated by the new Taoiseach. She also arrived in good time for the Dáil’s daily set piece. A big day for her party too – a nice change.Social distancingCardboard political place-settings were placed at intervals around the benches, setting out precisely where the TDs had to sit to comply with the extremely strict social distancing rules. There were very real fears that Mary Lou and Pearse Doherty might – through no fault of their own – thoroughly orchestrate a regulation-busting Sinn Féin crowd scene in their section, but they didn’t because this was Dublin and not west Belfast.The names on the place-settings changed since the curtailed sessions of previous weeks, when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs were given separate numbered spots. Now that the 33rd Dáil is under way, those two parties names have been replaced with the generic “Government” tag.Not a day assembled as a coalition in the old chamber and already the big two have lost their identities.On the other side of the floor, it was a case of high hopes and earplugs with Mary Lou finally earning first dibs on questioning a Taoiseach during Leaders’ questions. This is the most high-profile event of the Dáil day (except when a politician has to come in and make a grovelling apology for a lapse in standards).Then we had Cowen hauling himself in from the doghouse to beg forgiveness.Under normal circumstances, with BabyBiff’s tribulations added to the litany of Government howlers marking the start of Martin’s government, a scorching debut might have been expected from the steely Sinn Féin leader. But it was a subdued start from Mary Lou, who stuck to the issue of extended maternity leave and pay for new mothers who are facing particular difficulties are a result of the Covid-19 crisis.She expressed her concerns during two polite exchanges with the Taoiseach, who was equally concerned and polite.Micheál adopted a markedly different tone throughout his first Leaders’ Question, as if emphasising he was listening to the opposition during his time supporting the Fine Gael government and is going to be far more responsive than Leo Varadkar.Bout of hostilitiesAt the end of the first bout of hostilities between the Fine Gael and Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou’s response reflected her soft approach to this particular episode.“In that case, we are of one mind,” she told Micheál.That won’t happen too often. But then, following the embarrassing events for Sinn Féin in Belfast, it was probably wiser not to go drawing attention to the provisional route about licences and the like.Labour’s Alan Kelly took up the slack. He had no qualms reintroducing both the Government and Sinn Féin to recent embarrassments.When the sting of the last few weeks wear off for the main opposition, the Sinn Féin leader and the Labour leader will make a formidable team. They’ll be trying to outdo each other in knocking spots off Micheál.The Taoiseach will have to on stay on his toes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298678.1594157160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach criticises sinn f%C3%A9in s over focus on border poll ahead of meeting with foster","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he would take a ‘pragmatic’ approach and seek to promote ‘practical’ co-operation between North and South. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTaoiseach Micheál Martin is to travel to Northern Ireland on Thursday to meet First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, as the new Government sets out to “rejuvenate” North-South relations, officials said.Mr Martin told The  he would take a “pragmatic” approach and seek to promote “practical” co-operation between North and South and would not be pushing the British government for a Border poll.He said there were “two different philosophies and two approaches at work – one is just have a Border poll and get a majority, but mine is much more rooted in the Good Friday Agreement ... a consensus approach”.Earlier, answering his first series of questions as Taoiseach in the Dáil, he told Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: “I do not believe that precipitating or organising a referendum immediately is the way to go. That was the Sinn Féin position since Brexit happened, although it has come back a bit from that. ‘Consensus approach’“The over-focus on the Border poll was too isive and too partisan and ran counter to what Sinn Féin wanted to achieve. That is my view. I favour a different approach. For example, I favour a stronger North-South dimension now.”He said Ms McDonald wanted to adopt “a more territorial, majoritarian approach whereas I prefer to develop a more consensus approach”.In exchanges which made clear the ide between Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin on the issue, Ms McDonald said Brexit and coronavirus had “reshaped how people think and talk about reunification”. “Both of these crises have shown very dramatically the danger and jeopardy of the Border on our island. No longer is Irish unity discussed only in aspirational terms, it is now increasingly regarded as a common sense approach and essential to the prosperity of all of our people. “I say that because growing our green economy requires an all-Ireland approach. Protecting and building public health services and protecting public health itself requires an all-Ireland approach, as does strengthening our agricultural sector and defending rural Ireland. All of these things must be all-Ireland in nature,” she said.Ms McDonald was critical that the new “Shared Island” unit which has been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach will not be tasked with promoting constitutional change.“Will he establish an Oireachtas joint committee on Irish unity?” she asked. “Will he convene an all-island representative Citizens’ Assembly, or such an appropriate forum, to discuss and plan for constitutional change? Will he initiate the process for a referendum and get clarity on what the thresholds for triggering such a referendum might be?”Reconciliation Mr Martin said the Sinn Féin leader “has adopted a certain partisan approach to this issue”. “The agenda for the future on this island is how we engineer and develop an accommodation where we can all live in peace, harmony and reconciliation on the island and not to, at the outset, try to dictate to one tradition or one group what the solution is going to be, which seems to be the agenda the deputy is pursuing,” he said.Mr Martin has already spoken to Ms Foster and Ms O’Neill by phone, and officials have been working on setting up the meeting with the Stormont administration since he became Taoiseach more than a week ago.

Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"leicesters coronavirus infection rate drops early june level","story":"Leicester\u0027s rate of new Covid-19 cases has dropped to a level last seen nearly a month ago, new figures suggest.The equivalent of 106.4 cases per 100,000 people were detected in the city in the seven days to July 4, according to the latest data published by NHS Digital.This is the lowest level since 101.1 cases per 100,000 were recorded in the seven days to June 11.The rate peaked in the seven days to June 25, when 159.1 cases per 100,000 were recorded. Some parts of the country currently have no new cases per 100,000 population, including Bath and North East Somerset, the City of London and Portsmouth.Leicester\u0027s local lockdown was announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the evening of June 29 and restrictions were subsequently tightened in parts of the city and nearby suburbs, with non-essential shops ordered to close and people urged not to travel in or out of the area.In the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said: “We took, last week, difficult but vital decisions about Leicester.Since then we have been working with Leicester and Leicestershire and I am pleased to say that, together, we have brought down the seven-day infection rate to 117 cases per 100,000 people.“What we said when we took the measures just over a week ago is that we needed to see 14 days of data and so we proposed to make announcements on the next steps on the 18th July,” he added.“Of course if further measures are needed in the meantime to tighten up then we would take them immediately, but the good news is that the data are currently moving in the right direction.Mr Hancock continued to say that the country is “bringing coronavirus under control”, adding that Monday’s 352 new cases was the lowest since lockdown began, and down from over 5,000 a day at the peak.“209 patients are currently in mechanical ventilator beds, down from 3,300 at the peak,” he said.Attention has now turned to South Wales as Merthyr Tydfil could be the UK’s new coronavirus hotspot with a worse rate of infection than Leicester. According to Government statistics 179.5 cases were diagnosed for every 100,000 people in the Welsh town in the week up to July 1. The spike has been blamed on a recent outbreak at a meat processing plant.By comparison, the next highest area in Wales was Wrexham, which recorded 36 cases for every 100,000 people in the same week.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"workers told hmrc pay office based coronavirus tests paye","story":"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has dropped controversial plans to force workers to pay for coronavirus tests organised by their employers through their tax returns, on the eve of his coronavirus mini-Budget.HMRC guidance published this week had made clear that employees will face a taxable benefit in kind for private tests carried out in the workplace.The decision would have meant that an employee could see their take-home pay cut by more than £3,000 per year if they have to be regularly tested, according to calculations seen by The .The decision immediately raised fears that people will be put off from testing to avoid being left out of pocket. MPs said treating a coronavirus test as a workplace benefit was a joke.However, on Tuesday, within hours of Tory Treasury select committee chairman Mel Stride writing to Mr Sunak to complain about the plans, the Treasury dropped them late on Tuesday night, on the eve of Mr Sunak\u0027s statement to MPs about his plans to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.The guidance had said: Coronavirus (Covid-19) testing kits or tests carried out by a third party which have been purchased by you to provide to your employees, are treated as a taxable benefit in kind on the employee.This had meant that a cash value will be assigned to the coronavirus test by the employer, and the employee will pay Income Tax on this amount through Pay As You Earn (PAYE).Mr Strid said: “Many of our key workers could be faced with the perverse incentive of avoiding employer-sponsored tests in order to reduce their tax bill.“This can\u0027t be right. I’ve asked the Chancellor to look into this as soon as possible.”Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat leadership contender, added: We cannot have a system where you pay tax as you test.The government cannot class a vital health test as a \u0027benefit\u0027, and the idea that this is a perk for an employer or employee is a joke.People who fill out a self-assessment tax return would have had to declare the cost of any tests on it.Some frontline workers are now being tested as often as once a week. The tests can cost £150 each which means that privately testing one employee every week for a year could cost £7,800.A higher-rate taxpayer earning £60,000 would pay income tax of 40 per cent on this, equal to a total of £3,120 over the year, according to calculations by wealth manager Quilter.Someone making £30,000 a year, paying the lower rate of income tax, would face a 20 per cent charge (£1,560).Before the  U-turn was announced, Quilter’s Rachael Griffin said: “It’s unclear whether this was a snap decision made without thinking through the consequences or a money-making ploy.Tim Stovold of accountancy firm Moore Kingston Smith added: “It is absurd that HMRC should collect tax on employer provided kits. It just creates another barrier to getting people back to work.”Late Tuesday night a Treasury spokesman said: Given the importance of widespread testing, we want to ensure that all employers who wish to provide third-party testing to their employees can do so without increasing their tax liability.So, we will introduce a new income tax exemption for Covid-19 antigen tests provided by employers. HMRC will amend its guidance as soon as possible to reflect this change.”A source added: As most workers will already be able to access tests for free through the NHS, we expect the new exemption to only impact a small number of iniduals.The exemption will be in effect for any tests which have taken place during the current tax year 2020-21.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 080720","story":"Amber Heard, American actress and former wife of Hollywood actor Johnny Depp arrives on the first day of libel trial brought by Hollywood actor Johnny Depp against News Group Newspapers  over claims that he was violent to his former wife, Amber Heard. The High Court in LondonCoronavirus latest news: Donald Trump \u0026#39crippling international effort to defeat virus\u0026#39 as US cases top three millionMyanmar military airstrikes \u0026#39killed civilians\u0026#39 during conflict with insurgents says reportComment: It is unjust to brand the Kurds as terrorists\u0026#39Anti-English\u0026#39 border protest was \u0026#39inspired\u0026#39 by SNP leadersSahel crisis: charities warn of famine in Mali as militias leave farmers too scared to plant cropsHealthcare system \u0026#39not safe enough\u0026#39 for women taking medication during pregnancy concludes reviewComment: China’s aggressive tactics on Huawei will backfireSouth Korean court orders Kim Jong-un to compensate Seoul POWsChina opens headquarters for security agents in Hong KongPrince Andrew agonising over whether to condemn Ghislaine Maxwell, says sourceBritons headed for Costa Brava holiday may be expected to wear masks on the beach180 bodies found in \u0026#39killing field\u0026#39 in Burkina Faso, rights group reportsUS reaches grim milestone of 3 million infections as Covid-19 cases surgeBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19NHS must not use coronavirus crisis as excuse to avoid tackling failings, MPs sayFears of brain damage \u0026#39epidemic\u0026#39 as rise in inflammation is linked to coronavirusRestore hedges to pre-war levels to help UK become carbon neutral by 2050, says CPREPiles of sticks and leaves should be allowed to build up in towns to boost bug numbers, says wildlife charity bossMore than 3,700 \u0026#39high risk\u0026#39 offenders were homeless after being freed from jail despite serious re-offending risk, probation watchdog revealsRishi Sunak drops plans to force employees to pay for coronavirus testsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/07/16/coronavirus-bitcoin.jpg","title":"coronavirus bitcoin price trading south america covid 19 cases venezuela","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027The impact that Covid-19 has had on the cryptocurrency industry is huge,\u0027 analyst saysBitcoin trading has risen significantly in several South American countries currently experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, a study has revealed.Countries including Argentina, Chile and Colombia bucked a trend that saw the volume of bitcoin trading drop globally between 2019 and 2020.Cryptocurrency trades on the LocalBitcoins platform fell by more than a third in total – falling from £537 million to £337m – but rose in volume by nearly a quarter in Chile and more than doubled in Argentina.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData gathered by investment publication Invezz revealed the dramatic impact the coronavirus has had on bitcoin trading.

An apology is long overdue. What those who have suffered for so long deserve is decisive action that leads to real change, starting today.”Bozena Michalowska, a partner at Leigh Day law firm (which is representing patients treated with sodium valproate), added: “Action is needed now to ensure the recommendations are implemented quickly. The impact on society has been massive and continues to be as children affected by sodium valproate move through the education system and into the community. Those children will need to be looked after and cared for and families need practical guarantees that that will happen.”The Royal College of Surgeons has backed recommendations by the inquiry to create a new central database for collecting details of patients who have implants during surgery.Professor Derek Alderson, president of the college, said: “Most people would be astonished to know that when they have an operation and a medical device or implant is used, there is no systematic way of tracking that implant over the following months and years.“If years later, we become aware of a safety issue or problem with the implant, as happened with pelvic meshes, there may not be a complete record of which patients we need to contact.”He said the government’s current Medicines and Medical Devices Bill in parliament was the perfect legislative vehicle for enacting the recommendations.He added: “We are urging government to use a bill now going through parliament to put Baroness Cumberlege’s recommendation for a central database into law. Ministers don’t need to wait any longer.”Royal College of Surgeons\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A pocket-sized, insect-eating reptile that lived 237 million years ago was an ancestor of giant dinosaurs that went on to dominate the world, newly studied fossils suggest.Kongonaphon kely, whose scientific name means “tiny bug slayer,” stood at just 10cm (4ins) tall and 40cm (16ins) long. It inhabited a floodplain region of what is now southwestern Madagascar during the Triassic period, according to scientists who unveiled the species this week.A long-legged and possibly bipedal predator, the Kongonaphon was a member of a group called Ornithodira, which evolved into dinosaurs and their flying cousins pterosaurs. The origins of the later, larger reptiles are poorly known as few specimens from near the root of this lineage have been found.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut American and Madagascan researchers who described the new species in a study on Monday said their analysis suggested dinosaurs and pterosaurs “evolved from a miniaturised ancestor” that lived relatively recently before them.“There’s a general perception of dinosaurs as being giants,” said Christian Kammerer, a research curator in palaeontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. “But this new animal is very close to the ergence of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and it’s shockingly small.”Asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs hit at ‘deadliest possible angle’Dinosaurs and pterosaurs first appeared roughly 230 million years ago. The early dinosaur Herrerasaurus was about 6m (20ft) long, while the early pterosaur Eudimorphodon was pigeon-sized.Both groups eventually achieved gigantic proportions. The pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus had a wing of about 10.5m (35ft), akin to an F-16 fighter. The dinosaur Argentinosaurus reached about 35m(115ft) long.In the context of this later gigantism, an animal like Kongonaphon “that could fit into your hands seems almost paradoxical,” said Dr Kammerer, the study’s lead author. He suggested “some of these things would have been quite cute animals” that “would probably make a great pet”.“However, it fits the broader pattern that we observe at this time. There was a sustained trend towards smaller adult body sizes in the early history of this lineage,” he added.“This is based not only on Kongonaphon, but on a series of small-bodied reptiles near the common ancestry of the dinosaur and pterosaur lineages.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe fossils of Kongonaphon were discovered in 1998 in Madagascar by a team of researchers led by John Flynn, curator of fossil mammals at the American Museum of Natural History.Dr Flynn said: “This fossil site in southwestern Madagascar from a poorly known time interval globally has produced some amazing fossils, and this tiny specimen was jumbled in among the hundreds we’ve collected from the site over the years.“It took some time before we could focus on these bones, but once we did, it was clear we had something unique and worth a closer look.”Researchers said the shape of Kongonaphon’s small, conical and unserrated teeth and an examination of microscopic wear on them suggest it ate insects or other small invertebrates. Analysis of a cross section of fossilised bone indicate the specimen found was likely a mature animal.Kongonaphon is not the first small species known near the root of the ornithodiran family tree, but previously such specimens were considered “isolated exceptions to the rule,” Dr Kammerer noted. In general, the scientific belief was that body size remained similar among the first archosaurs – the larger reptile group that includes birds, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs – before increasing to gigantic proportions among dinosaurs.Dr Kammerer said: “Recent discoveries like Kongonaphon have given us a much better understanding of the early evolution of ornithodirans. Analysing changes in body size throughout archosaur evolution, we found compelling evidence that it decreased sharply early in the history of the dinosaur-pterosaur lineage.”The findings could help to answer questions about how and why dinosaurs evolved as they did. For instance, the researchers believe the fuzzy skin coverings and feathers found on both dinosaurs and pterosaurs may have originated in their miniature common ancestor, which would have required extra help to keep its small body warm in the mid-late Triassic era of climatic extremes.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry.

But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Rishi Sunak is coming under intense pressure to extend furlough and self-employed support schemes in Wednesday’s emergency mini-budget, in the hope of staving off a threatened wave of job losses as the UK emerges from coronavirus.The chancellor’s hotly anticipated Covid-19 recovery plan will feature a £2bn “kickstart” fund to subsidise hundreds of thousands of work placements for the 16-24 year-old age group whose job prospects have been hit hardest by the pandemic, in what the Treasury described as “the biggest package of support for youth employment in decades”.But unions said it was no more than a “good first step” towards halting mass youth unemployment. And critics said it fell short of Boris Johnson’s promise of “the chance of an apprenticeship or in-work placement” for every young person, with participants potentially earning as little as £161 a week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government had failed to “rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis” and should stem unnecessary job losses by tailoring the withdrawal of support to the needs of sectors which face long delays before returning to pre-crisis activity.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in Bristol“However, the government are yet to rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis. The urgent priority right now is to prevent additional unnecessary unemployment in the first place by abandoning the government’s one-size-fits-all approach to the removal of the job retention and self-employed schemes. In addition, older people who become unemployed, and those living in particularly hard-hit areas, will also need tailored support.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe Resolution Foundation think tank has said that £3-5bn should be spent on extending furlough payments beyond the planned end-date of 31 October for sectors which will return to normal most slowly, such as hospitality, retail and entertainment, as part of a £200bn stimulus package to shore up the post-Covid economy.And the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said Mr Sunak must do “whatever it takes” in the package due to be unveiled to the House of Commons at lunchtime on Wednesday to support jobs in order to avoid “permanent long-term damage to the economy”.Prematurely ending the furlough scheme – under which the state pays 80 per cent of monthly wages, up to a maximum of £2,500 – risks permanently higher unemployment and weaker productivity, with a potential loss of £50bn a year to GDP, said the think tank.The £60bn job retention scheme is currently due to be wound down from the start of August, with employers in all sectors having to pay a progressively larger share of furloughed staff’s wages until it ends in November.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailNiesr’s deputy director Garry Young said it would make “economic sense” for Sunak to announce it will continue until GDP returns to 2019 levels, warning: “Premature withdrawal of the measures could mean that the long-term adverse impact on the public finances ends up being worse than the cost of continued short-term support.”And the Scottish National Party said the furlough scheme should continue as long as each of the four UK nations requires it.Michael Kill of the Night-Time Industries Association said nightclubs and entertainment venues need continued bounce-back grants and furlough payments in full until the end of 2020 to avoid being “crippled” by Covid-19.“These businesses account for an annual revenue of over £66bn per year and 8 per cent of UK employment, so it would be incomprehensible if the furlough scheme ends too quickly for staff in our venues,” he warned. “Thousands will be plunged into unemployment.”Meanwhile, MPs supporting the pressure group ExcludedUK have written to Mr Sunak urging him to provide help for groups like freelancers, the newly self-employed, small company directors and those who started new jobs after mid-March, who have so far been denied support in the form of furloughs, grants or loans.Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone, who on Tuesday launched an all-party parliamentary group to back the estimated 3 million excluded from help, urged Mr Sunak to meet with them, saying: “It is simply unacceptable that many iniduals are ineligible for every kind of support, even universal credit, for entirely arbitrary reasons. The chancellor must stop burying his head in the sand.”The party’s acting leader Ed Davey said it was a “gross injustice” that many self-employed people were not covered.The Kickstart scheme will allow employers to offer young people at risk of long-term unemployment a six-month work placement, with the government funding 100 per cent of the national minimum wage for the first 25 hours a week – the equivalent of £161 for 18-20 year-olds and £205 for under-25s.The chancellor is also expected to announce a £111m investment to triple traineeships in 2020-21, an extra £32m for the national careers service and £17m of extra funding for sector-based work academy placements in 2020-21. “Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic,” said Mr Sunak.“We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The chancellor has made a good first step. But we’ll be checking the small print to ensure every job provides proper training and a bridge to steady employment.  “Employers must do the right thing. They should work with unions to avoid job displacement, create good opportunities for all young workers and guarantee they are paid at least the real living wage.”  And CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn described the proposed scheme as “a much-needed down-payment in young people’s futures”.“Business and government must now work to deliver the kickstart scheme simply and at speed,” said Dame Carolyn. “There can be no time lost in preparing young people who are entering one of the toughest jobs markets we’ve seen in decades.”But Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran warned the scheme would prove “too little too late for many of the corona class of 2020”.“Boris Johnson pledged a month ago that every young person would be offered an apprenticeship,” said Ms Moran. “This announcement appears to fall far short of that promise.“Eighteen-year olds could be left being paid just £161 a week under this scheme, which in some parts of the country would barely cover rent and transport costs. We risk losing a generation who will never recover their earnings.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle.

Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have two entirely contradictory positions.“If we both dig our heels in on those positions, there will be no discussion or agreement on fisheries and therefore no agreement on trade. That is not what we want.”Lord Norman Lamont has said he is sure the EU will offer Britain a trade deal because the British have insisted there will be no further extension of the transition period.Speaking to Brexit Watch, Lord Lamont said: #Until recently, I thought the negotiations had gone quite badly.#By the word badly, I mean, the likelihood of an agreement was not high.#Personally, I would prefer an agreement to no deal.#But recently Ive detected, perhaps because the British have insisted there will be no extension of the transition period, theres a slight increase in the willingness of the EU to try to reach a deal.#I think the EU is keener now, it has been convinced that Britain is not going to ask for an extension to the extension.#It is anxious to reach a deal itself.#A political polling expert has said support for an independent Scotland is #not just a blip#.Mark Dfley said there is a pattern emerging supporting Scottish independence.He said that while support for Scottish independence rose after the Brexit vote, it did not last.However, he said that the results now were #much more signicant# and had been steadily growing for six to eight months.Mr Dfley said: #It seems thatthere was a choice to be in an independent Scotland that was within the EU, that would be preferable to being part of the UK but out of the EU.#Previous no voters, who voted to stay in the UK but also wanted to stay within the EU, are moving more to yes.#Of course it does go the other way # people who voted for an independent Scotland who also voted for Brexit, some would rather now be in the UK outside of Europe. But that first group is much larger.#Boris Johnson spoke to German chancellor Angela Merkel today and told her that the UK #would be ready# to leave the transition period at the end of the year without a trade deal with the EUone cannot be agreed.“On the future relationship, the prime minister underlined the UK’s commitment to working hard to find an early agreement out of the intensied talks process,” a Downing Street spokeswoman said. “He also noted that the UK equally would be ready to leave the transition period on Australia termsan agreement could not in the end be reached.”Australia does not have a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU.Much of EU-Australia trade follows default World Trade Organisation rules, though specic agreements are in place for certain goods, Reuters reports.Michel Barnier has opened the door for City businesses to access EU markets after Brexit.Giving evidence to the House of Lords European Union committee, Mr Barnier hinted that the EU was ready to unilaterally give access to some UK financial companies. “We are ready to grant equivalence,” he said. “The time for decisions is in the autumn, in good time, in the global context of our negotiations on many subjects with the UK.”It comes as one-to-one negotiations with David Frost started in London today.Tomorrow the two negotiating teams will meet in Whitehall for more informal talks.Ineos Automotive is considering scrapping its plan to build a car plant in Wales, the manufacturer has announced.The firm said it is in talks with Mercedes-Benz over acquiring the German companys Hambach factory in Moselle, France, instead of building new facilities in Bridgend and Portugal.Production of a new # vehicle named Grenadier was due to begin in Bridgend next year.Around  jobs were due to be created initially, but that was expected to increase to  once the vehicle reached full production.Chemicals giant Ineos is run by billionaire Sir Jim Ratclfe, a vocal supporter of Brexit.It was reported in February  that he was moving to Monaco to avoid UK taxes on his fortune.A UK Government spokesperson said: #Were continuing to work to ensure Wales and the whole of the UK is an attractive location for cutting-edge automotive technologies # just last week making £ million of funding available to scale up low-carbon innovation.#Todays news from Ineos is disappointing but we will continue to work alongside the Welsh Government to support the automotive industry in South Wales.#The EUs Michel Barnier and the UKs David Frost will have a quiet meal tonight in No to discuss how the talks are progressing.Downing Street stressed they would stick to strict social distancing rules at all times.The pair will dine on a starter of asparagus salad, followed by halibut, and then summer fruit terrine for dessert.This is the menu:Starter: Chargrilled asparagus, courgettes and cherry tomato saladMain: Fillet of halibut with lemon, anchovy, rosemary  capers, potatoes and seasonal vegetables.Dessert: A Terrine of Summer Fruits with vanilla ice cream.Michel Barnier has arrived at  Downing Street.He was pictured with David Frost ahead of an informal dinner.A Downing Street spokesperson said the two men would meet tonight in an informal setting to discuss some of the negotiations’ most dficult sticking points.These include EU access to UK fishing waters and business competition regulations known as the level playing field.Kirsten Oswald MP has been elected as the new SNP Westminster deputy leader.The SNPs new deputy leader at Westminster will play a key role in holding the Conservative Government to account, Ian Blackford has said.Mr Blackford, the SNP leader in the Commons, praised his new deputy, saying that she #brings a wealth of talent and experience to the role#.He added: #This is an important time as we deal with the Covid- crisis and look to build a fairer Scotland.#With the threat of a Tory Brexit growing, and crucial decisions over the economic emergency, Kirsten will play a key role as we hold the Tory Government to account.#European Union leaders could be #very reluctant# to allow the UK to rejoin their group, but could welcome an independent Scotland into the trading block, an expert has claimed.Kirsty Hughes, who was the director of the Scottish Centre on Europe Relations , said the issue of an independent Scotland joining the EU was a completely dferent question to whether the UK could ever be allowed back in.If Scots voted for independence in a legally binding referendum, she forecast there would be #complete openness# from the  EU nations to allowing entry.Speaking at a webinar organised by the European Movement in Scotland, she said: #On the Scottish side I think there is complete opennessScotland was to vote Yes in a constitutionally and legally valid referendum.#There is complete openness to welcoming another small, northern European country into the European Union.#She added that not only was Scotland seen as pro-European, given the vote to remain in the EU in , she said that its #politics looks more normal at the moment#.The European Union will introduce full border checks with the UK on January , Michel Barnier has said.It comes even though the UK plans to impose customs controls on EU goods six months later.The EUs chief negotiator told a House of Lords Committee Brussels “will not delay things” after Britain announced a gradual three phased implementation of border checks of its own.Full border checks will now only apply on EU goods entering the UK from July , Thereports.Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said a referendum on Irish unity is #imperative# to growing the Irish economy.She said: #A united Ireland is the best idea for the future of our country.#It is essential to the prosperity of all our people because growing our economy requires an all-Ireland approach.#Protecting our health service requires an all-Ireland approach.#Mr Martin said an all island unit has been set up in the Department of the Taoiseach but said Sinn Feins insistence on a border poll is isive.He said: #I dont believe precipitating or organising a referendum like that is the way to go.#That was the Sinn Fein position since Brexit happened and you have come back a bit from it.##I think the over focus on the border poll was too isive, too partisan and would only run counter to what you wanted to achieve.#I would favour a dferent approach. I would favour a stronger north-south relationship and the development of that.#He added: #The agenda for the future of this island is how we engineer and develop an accommodation where we can all live in peace and harmony on the island and to not try to dictate to one tradition about what the solution is going to be which seems to be the agenda youre pursuing.#The Good Friday Agreement is the defining document because it is based on three sets of relationships, the British-Irish relationship, the north-south relationship and the two traditions within Northern Ireland itself.#The pound rose to a three-week high today, strengthening almost one percent against the euro.It surged on optimism that British and EU trade negotiators could find common ground at a dinner planned for later in the day.Kenneth Broux, an analyst at Societe Generale, said: #I think there is a little bit of optimism today for the dinner that is taking place tonight at  Downing Street.#The market is looking at what is going to give a boost in the next six months# but I think its mostly flow driven and volumes that are not really heavy.#The word ‘“gammon” is back in the news after a row erupted on a BBC podcast where white women were told not to become “Karens”.“Gammon” is used as an insult to describe middle-aged white men, commonly those who supported Brexit and are politically right wing.Interviewees on the latest episode of No Country for Young Women told white women that they needed to #read some books# and #get out of the way,” sparking a furious backlash.Tory MP Ben Bradley tweeted: “BBC spending £m on ersity and this junkwhilst at the same time ditching regional news in order to save £m.“Absolute joke. Cancelling my TV license. I dont need to pay for this.”TalkRADIO presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer commented: “So I’m a gammon, a boomer and now I’m a Karen too.“Another day, another insult.

It’s expected one subject the pair will address is fishing # a major sticking point in trade talks. Barnier has already backed down on the UK leaving the Common Fisheries Policy, and opting instead for zonal attachment. But, ironically, the Brexit and EU chiefs will tonight dine on halibut.The EU’s chief negotiator will meet the UK’s David Frost tonight for further Brexit talks.No said this lunchtime: “Michel Barnier and David Frost will have a private dinner at No this evening.“Informal talks with their teams will begin tomorrow.”Downing Street stressed they would stick to strict social distancing rules at all times.David Starkey has apologised after saying slavery was not genocide because there were “so many damn blacks” still around.He admitted his “bad mistake” on YouTube cost him “every distinction and honour acquired in a long career”.Starkey, , said: “It was intended to emphasise, in hindsight with awful clumsiness, the numbers who survived the horrors of the slave trade.“Instead, it came across as a term of racial abuse.#This, in the present atmosphere, where passions are high and feelings raw, was deplorably inflammatory.#I am very sorry for it and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused.#I have also paid a heavy price for one offensive word with the loss of every distinction and honour acquired in a long career.#Starkey sparked fury after making the remarks during an online interview with Brexit campaigner Darren Grimes for his YouTube channel Reasoned UK.Foreign Secretary has promised to forge a new vision of a “truly global Britain”.Speaking as he introduced sanctions against China for their treatment of Hong Kong, he said: “As we forge a dynamic new vision for a truly global Britain, this Government are absolutely committed to the United Kingdom becoming an even stronger force for good in the world.”He also pledged “to keep the flame of freedom alive for those brave souls still suffering in the very darkest corners of the world.”The EU has backed down on the UK exiting the Common Fisheries Policy.Michel Barnier finally accepted the UK’s request that fishing opportunities are ided based on data that reflects the number of fish in British waters.The scientic method is known as zonal attachment, and is designed to benefit UK fishermen as the new method accommodates for changing water temperatures due to climate change.Brussels had demanded that EU boats should have the same access to UK waters before Mr Barnier admitted it “was not balanced”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or show no symptoms at all.It means that young people are actually at higher risk of spreading the virus to more vulnerable people, potentially without even realising.Some young people may also have underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic asthma and hypertension, which put them in the at-risk group.But there have been a number of cases in which young people have ended up in hospital or even dying from Covid without having any health issues.Last month, a -day-old baby with no known underlying conditions became Britains youngest coronavirus victim.  The most recent figures from the Office for National Statisticstoday showed that deaths overall in the UK are below normal - and coronavirus fatalities have fallen to the lowest level since before lockdown.But experts warn that while these figures are great news, it doesnt mean the pandemic is over.New positive cases of Covid- had been decreasing as a result of lockdown but this has levelled off in the past few weeks with infections stalling.Deaths tend to lag behind infections as it can take up to two weeks for symptoms to show, experts say.Also, people might not get tested immediately which could lead to a more severe illness and result in hospital care, or ultimately death.Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor at George Washington University School of Medicine, told \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"CNN: It takes about a week after someone becomes infected until they get sick enough to be hospitalised, and then often about a week after that until you start seeing deaths.Boris Johnson said the country had to meet five key tests before lockdown could be eased.These included making sure the rate of infection was decreasing to manageable levels.One of the ways this is tracked is by measuring the R rate - which refers to the average number of people that one infected person can pass the virus on to. If its above one, it will spread exponentially, infecting more and more people.With theR rate below the crucial value of one across the country, the Prime Minister was able to announce that the restrictions could ease further and on July  pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers were allowed to reopen.But some regions, such as the north east, are only just teetering under one, so officials are monitoring the situation carefully.There have also been localised outbreaks such as in Leicester, so the city has been forced back into lockdown to prevent the spread.The Government has warned that it wont hesitate to put other areas under tougher measures - forcing the economy to shutdown again -cases rise.While face masks arent guaranteed to stop someone from catching the virus, they can be helpful in preventing infected people from spreading it.They can stop viral particles from sneezes, coughs and even talking from being released.Currently, Brits have to wear a face mask or covering when using public transport or face being fined.Experts have also advised people to wear one when in places where its harder to socially distance, such as supermarkets.Its not compulsory but some experts are calling on the Government to make face coverings mandatory.Homemade masks wont offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasnt stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.The president of the Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan said other countries have managed to implement the use of face masks into their daily lives so there was no reason why the UK should not have implemented a more stringent policy.Meanwhile, new research by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.However, they need to be worn properly - intermittently putting them on and off increases the number of times you touch your face.For the general public, more effective methods of protecting yourself from infection include regularly washing your hands, not touching your face, disinfecting surfaces, and social distancing.Brits have been advised not to purchase surgical coverings due to a shortage or personal protective equipment for NHS workers.The Government has released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.If you already have a mask then there is no harm in wearing it, but make sure your mask is sanitised and that your hands are clean when taking it off and putting it on. And wash your hands again after taking it off.Most people who catch coronavirus only show symptoms about five days after being infected - but it can take up to  days in some cases.One study, published in the Lancet, found that during the initial five days - where people reported feeling fine - is when the highest amount of viral shedding happens.This is when infectious particles from the virus spread from one person to another.Experts still dont know how many people are asymptomatic, which is why it is important to self-isolate for  daysyou have knowingly been exposed to the virus.Its also vital to quarantine evenyou dont have the key symptoms of a persistent cough or a fever.The Government recently added a loss of taste or smell to the list of signs that could suggest a mild form of Covid-.Less common symptoms may include myalgia , nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, soyou feel unwell always contact NHS .With widespread job losses, economic recession and being confined to our homes at the forefront of our mind, its easy to see why this theory crops up.But allowing everyone to become infected with coronavirus - to gain whats known as herd immunity - could have serious negative impacts.A team of scientists at Imperial College London modelled what this would look like in the UK and predicted that it could lead to a quarter of a million deaths that would completely overwhelm the NHS for months.It would also prevent people from accessing healthcare, emergency services and even prescriptions for normal medical reasons, while doctors and nurses are off sick.People could begin dying from minor conditions such as asthma attacks, heart attacks, pregnancy complications, everyday accidents, bacterial infections and more.Experts from \" href\"https:www.kcl.ac.uk blog-the-ten-most-dangerous-coronavirus-myths-debunked-\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Kings College London say that instead of this scenario, governments are aiming to eventually achieve widespread immunity with vaccination - when one becomes available. This way a large part of the population will become immunised in a controlled manner, drastically minimising the devastating potential of the virus.While flu cases decline over the summer, experts dont yet knowthis is what will happen with Covid-.The warmer weather can help as people can spend more time outdoors, where its easier to socially distance.Thats why doctors are concerned about a second wave this winter.But as its a brand new virus, humans havent developed a level of immunity yet, so evenit is seasonal, prevalence may continue to increase as it infects more of the population.Coronavirus spreads via droplets from coughs and sneezes, but you dont necessarily have to be close to the infected person to catch it.It can easily live on a range of surfaces for several days.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.In fact, the US Centres for Disease Control and Preventiondiscovered that Covid- survived on surfaces for  days - after infected passengers disembarked from a cruise ship.So disinfecting surfaces and washing your hands regularly is so vital to stop the spread.An alcohol-based disinfectant is enough to kill the virus on surfaces.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now he appears to know several other commands.Devine said she was inspired to try out the soundboard with Bunny after seeing other dog owners use the training method online.She decided to try the method with Bunny after seeing videos of speech language pathologist Christina Hunger have success using the communication technique with her dog, Stella.Devines soundboard technique gradually developed to be more advanced.The first soundboard that we used was one that I had made after following Christinas guidance on her blog, she said. We used that for several months before I connected with Leo Trottier, who is a cognitive scientist.He was looking for beta testers of a new device and that is the board we are currently using with Bunny.In another video posted to TikTok, Devine acknowledged that its dficult to say for sureBunny actually knows what she is communicating.I am not a scientist but I recognize that large amounts of data need to be collected before we can make a judgment as to whether or not Bunny actually understands what shes saying, she said.Im also aware that I inevitably skew the data in favor of saying that Bunny is consciously communicating with me.Either way, she said, its a fun and exciting experiment to try out with the beloved family pup.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some % believed Arnieaposs cyborg assassin from the  blockbuster film was a prime illustration of the technology. The revelation stands in stark contrast to Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs claim in a speech last week that Britain could “lead the world” in AI. A survey carried out into peopleaposs understanding of articial intelligence lays bare how much work remains to be done. In the hit “Iaposll be back” science-fiction movie, the T- Terminator is sent back in time from  to  to kill Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton.Her son will one day become a saviour against machines in a post-apocalyptic future – and needs to be destroyed.AIpioneer Yoshua Bengio told the BBC in October  he was not a fan of the Terminator films.They paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future, he said. We are very far from super-intelligent AI systems and there may even be fundamental obstacles to get much beyond human intelligence. But for % Britons, the film is a chilling demonstration of what AI can offer.The reality is more useful – predictive texting on mobile phones uses AI, as do apps like Uber and Google Maps. However, just % of people questioned believed they had encountered AI in the past three months. Researchers uncovered big gender gaps, with % of women saying they did not know when they last encountered AI –they ever had. Some % of men thought they had used it in the past  weeks. The online Populus study of , adults was carried out for communications agency Zinc Network. Executive director Louis Brooke said: “The Government has laid out an ambitious agenda for AI, seeking to turn the UK into a world leader in this area. “AI will play a vital role in helping the UK exit lockdown and overhauling health, education, travel and the workplace. Yet this data shows public understanding of AI is chronically low, particularly amongst women. For the public to buy into new uses for AI technologies, it will be vital to ensure that innovations are well understood, and benefit those who may be the most sceptical.” Some of those quizzed readily understood the technology, saying they thought it included “any sort of robot that can react to its surroundings and doesnapost need programming” and “chat bots used by companies to deal with customer service queries”. But others were more fearful of AIaposs potential to oust humans from the workplace.

The country stands on the brink of a devastating recession that would bring with it unemployment, poverty and despair. If we are to avoid that fate, the Chancellor must come up with an ambitious rescue package that works for the whole country. The promise of support to help young people find work is a welcome step. So too is the extra investment in the green economy. But there is an urgent need for action for those who stand to lose their jobs as the furlough scheme is wound down. Many of these jobs could be savedthe Chancellor kept the Job Retention Scheme for the sectors worst affected by Covid-, such as aviation, retail and hospitality. He should also use this opportunity to raise wages for our heroic key workers. And there must be more to help our high streets as they emerge from the lockdown. The Government was too slow to respond to the medical crisis. It must not make the same mistake with the economic emergency. If Mr Sunak fails to rise to the challenge, the price will be another generation blighted by unemployment and deprivation. Ban fur cruelty  There are not many industries more abhorrent than the fur trade. Fur farming has been banned in the UK since  but almost £million worth of pelts are still imported each year. Now we have left the EU, the Government can easily ban these imports. Our demand for action has the support of animal rights campaigners, opposition parties and celebrities.

Health officials have warned aposlocal lockdownsapos will be required going forward as the country learns to adapt to outbreaks of Covid- on a more regional level. One lockdown is ongoing in Leicester after a sharp increase in positive tests. The number of cases being found in Leicester was the highest in the country per ,, going from  to  cases in seven days to June . This was when Leicester went into lockdown with an infection rate three times higher than the next highest local area. But in good news today Health Secretary Matt Hancock, asked directly about Leicester, said the seven-day infection rate in the city has fallen to  per , people. He said the development underlined the importance of the dficult but vital decision to impose a lockdown. The Merseyside borough of Knowsley saw the sharpest increase in cases, from six to  per , in the seven days to June . Six areas have seen the infection rate per , increase over the week to June , according to the statistics. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES ARE STILL GOING UPMerthyr Tydfil has increased from . cases per , to . Knowsley has increased from . cases per , to . Bolton has increased from . cases per , to . Sheffield has increased from . cases per , to . Doncaster has increased from . cases per , to . Blackpool has increased from . cases per , to .The huge rise at Merthyr Tydfil, which takes it beyond Leicester, has been attributed to a cluster of  positive cases at Kepakaposs St Merryn meat plant.  Public Health Wales has said the surge in cases stems from increased testing with most of the positive cases uncovered on the same day. Factory floors are coming into sharp focus as having the potential for rapid cluster outbreaks with garment factories in Leicester also linked to a sharp increase in cases. On July  Bolton’s director of public health, Dr Helen Lowey, said: “The current situation in Bolton is very dferent to that in Leicester.The number of cases being confirmed in Bolton has been in decline over the past two weeks. “We will continue to closely review the data for Bolton and advise any measures that become necessary. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth - a Leicester MP - asked what would trigger the lting of the lockdown in the city. He said: What is the exit strategy for Leicester  How does an area that has gone into a local lockdown escape from a local lockdown  Mr Ashworth said in Germany, lockdowns were lted when cases got down to  per , people. Mr Hancock said  days of data were needed and the next steps would be announced on July .He would not give a specic figure for lting the lockdown because both the level and the rate of change matters. If the level were lower but it was going up, that could be a worse situation than a higher level that is under control and falling, he added. The statistics do show some good news with areas that had previously been a concern showing a fall in cases per ,, indicating it is likely the key aposRapos rate in the area is below one. AREAS WHERE CORONAVIRUS RATES HAVE SHARPLY FALLENBradford where cases have decreased from . per , to . Gwynedd where cases have gone down from . per , to . Wrexham where cases have plunged from . per , to . In Barnsley cases have dropped from . per , to .The drop in Wrexham is supporting the belief held by Public Health Wales that an outbreak at a meat factory in the area has not widely spread into the community.

Adam Gray, , York, North Yorks., had begun suffering from abdominal pains on hisfrom honeymoon in South Africa with pregnant we Christine and went to see a doctor. Days later he was given the devastating news he had a rare form of cancer, dubbed a silent killer due to the lack of early symptoms. Adam said his perfect le had been turned upside down in the space of  hours in July . The family are now raising funds to get specialist treatment in Germany which could further prolong his le, as well as fund crucial research in search of a cure.Adam, originally from York, North Yorks., told the Daily Record: We were about to welcome our first daughter into the world. I just got a new job in London and I felt great.Then it felt like my world just came crashing down out of nowhere. The lawyer - who would cycle nine miles to work every day and played football on weekends - admitted he never once thought he could get so ill.  Doctors had nearly sent the fitness mad dad home but following some tests and an ultrasound they discovered the cancer had spread through his pancreas, liver, lungs and lymph nodes. Pancreatic cancers are incredibly hard to identy during the early stages, with Adamaposs endocrine tumours spreading aggressively for at least two years. By the time he felt anything was wrong, it was already too late. The London-based lawyer said: The first year prospects were not good.  Adam spent  and a half months on chemotherapy where he underwent  cycles but the tumours kept growing - and ballooned to over cm by cm. He couldnapost sleep for days and weeks due to the chemotherapy and was left in excruciating pain as he took on the aggressive cancer. But he said witnessing the birth of his daughter was the happiest moment of his le.  He said: I was on chemo at that point and I was feeling awful. Just in pain all the time and being sick. But my daughter Amelie was born and it was the best day of my le. Adam and his we and newborn have been shielding since lockdown and keeping spirits up by enjoying each day together. Iaposve got my beautul bundle of joy and I think this has all changed my perspective on le, continued Adam. I was very work and fitness oriented - but family is my only focus now. Theyaposre my everything. I want to live in the present and cherish every moment with them.

Del Roberts, , said his cross-breed mongrel Dutch was ripped to shreds before he could be freed with the help of two soldiers from a nearby barracks. The injured dog then fled and ran a mile home alone, despite the horric injuries. Mental health nurse Mr Roberts was walking his dog at around am on Saturday on a literally deserted field in Bootle, Merseyside, when the incident took place.He told the Liverpool Echo the two hunting dogs then appeared without collars or leads along with a man who warned him they play a bit heavy.When I got to the very far end of the field, out from behind a hedge came two lurchers and a guy with them. Mr Roberts said Dutch and the two Lurchers snfed each other for no more than  seconds, but as his dog turned away the Lurchers switched and became aggressive. He said: One of them bit his neck and then the other came over and the pair of them just ripped him to shreds.  My dog was screaming. I have never ever heard a noise like it, it was between a howl and a bark. Mr Roberts said the Lurchers did not have collars, and due to the rain it was extremely dficult to pull them off his terried dog. They were finally able to free Dutch, described as a happy, friendly dog, when the two soldiers from the nearby Territorial Army barracks joined the struggle.  Mr Roberts and the soldiers managed to wrap Dutchaposs lead around the necks of the Lurchers to pull them off. He said: His throat was basically hanging out. He was lying on the floor and I thought there is no way he is going to get up, heaposs not going to make it. One of the soldiers came over and said I should get him away because the Lurchers could slip the lead at any moment. But Dutch got up and ran off, he ran a mile home with his throat hanging out. Mr Roberts said he and his partner Claire rushed Dutch to Vets  Pets in Walton Vale, where he underwent emergency surgery.

Has your pub been forced to close because a customer has tested positive for coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror It reads: This isn’t the message we wanted to write so soon but The Lighthouse will be closed due to a customer testing positive to Covid-. We are slowly getting through our list of customers that were in the pub on Saturday. All our staff are going to be tested and we will reopen when the time is safe to do so. Thanks to all the positive phone calls. Prior to The Lighthouse opening it had posted on its Facebook page a list of new rules that customers must stick to including all patrons must give their name and address to staff and sanitise before entering entering the building.  It also stated that furniture should not be moved for any reason as it has been placed to comply with social distancing and there is a one way system throughout the premises.

We are in this together to keep all of us safe, hope to see you all soon. The Lighthouse Family. The Fox  Hounds, in Batley, West Yorkshire, also reopened on Saturday and announced they were closed in a Facebook post today.  The pubs are believed to be the first in England to close and have to contact customers due to coronavirus. The post said: Following our announcement this morning that we will be closed until further notice Iaposd like to put all rumours and speculations straight that are currently floating about. This morning I got a phone call off a customer which visited our pub on Saturday to say theyaposd tested positive for coronavirus. On their visit they were unaware and had no symptoms but after seeing a post off another place theyaposd visited thought it was best to take a test to which they came back positive.  Due to privacy reasons we wonapost be naming this person. Following this information we are awaiting further guidance from NHS and track and trace. Myself and all staff have taken a test today and we should have results back within  hours. The pub manager added that the premises will be deep cleaned before they reopen.  The post ended: We fully understand this is a scary time but want to ensure our customer safety is our main priority in these tough times. Over the past few weeks we have put a lot of hard work into the pub following government guidance to get us opened back up. Anyone that has visited us this weekend can see our new layout of tables of one metre plus, our one way systems, full table service and continuously cleaning throughout. A third pub in Alverstoke, Hampshire, also announced on its Facebook that a customer had tested positive for Covid- so it was closed.

He was found dead on June  following a coffee catch-up with his mum. She recalled Mike, who lived in Worcester, as seeming aposfull of joyapos and looking forward to a job interview he had secured. His devastated mum, who is a teacher, is sharing his story to raise awareness of mental health in a bid to prevent suicide.She told the BBC he was “the kind of person who always worried about someone .”The mum-of-two added: Mike was the le and soul of the party who always put others first and worried about everyone but himself. He had only been at the job for approximately six weeks and they couldnapost afford to keep him on after furlough so got rid of him. He was a really smart man with a bright future ahead of him yet he felt inadequate because he couldnapost get a job after months of applying. The financial strain and being alone all day, every day, began to affect him. I was with him on the day he died, we laughed and joked whilst drinking coffee - he seemed fine and he was in good spirits. When I left his home, he was cooking dinner - it breaks my heart that I didnapost know how he was really feeling.  I received a call at midnight stating he had attempted suicide - I live  minutes away and by the time i had got there, it was too late. I felt helpless and it is a horrendous feeling knowing he was hurting so bad but felt like he couldnapost reach out to anyone. We were incredibly close and I thought he could tell me anything, we had previously been to the doctors for him to get help - they gave him medication and put him on a six-month waiting list. It is frustrating that they werenapost able to sit and speak to him because maybe he would still be here today. Mike was a keen American football player, and he hoped to pursue a career in motor sport engineering. Rachel is urging other young men with depression to seek help. She said: I was the kind of mum that always gave him privacy and space but supported him in everything he did. Mike and I were really close - we would go motor racing as he was in to cars. And off-roading with him driving land rovers! I miss him so much - I will miss him popping in for a cup of tea or our shopping trips - he would always make me laugh by trying on silly things.

Married Sarah Dowson persuaded the then--year-old that during their sex trysts he had made her pregnant. She was only caught out when police spent £, investigating her fraud and unearthed  baby scans she had bought on the internet. She had had sex with the teenager in woodland and fields after falling for him while celebrating his birthday. Jailing the -year-old mother, a judge told her: This was a mendacious course perpetrated against a young man  years your junior, who did not want to continue to have a sexual relationship with you. Your conduct was deliberate and vengeful, designed to cause trouble for your victim. At Reading Crown Court, Dowson admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. Her husband Thomas Dowson admitted one count of perverting the course of justice. He received a suspended sentence. The court heard that when the teenager told Dowson that he wanted to end their affair, she told him she had become pregnant. She started bombarding his mother with requests for child maintenance payments, after brandishing the baby scan photos. When the teenageraposs family went to the police to complain about harassment, Dowson lodged a malicious allegation that the teen had raped her. She then further lied about him showing up at her home and sending her malicious messages, lies which were backed up by her husband, who believed the rape claim. Judge Morris heard that the lies by Dowson started to unravel when police found the results of a DNA test, which she had hidden from the teenager and his family and which proved it was her husband who was the father all along. The teenager had to wrongly tell his parents he had fathered a child, leading to a three-and-a-half year period where his family looked after the baby boy ashe were their own, the court heard. Prosecutor Simon Jones told the court that Dowson started sending sexual messages to the teenager. She had sex with him in a wooded area after they went out to celebrate his th birthday, the judge was told.  A few weeks after this, Mrs Dowson contacted [the teen] to say she was pregnant and it was his baby. [The teen] was not happy about that and he made no secret of the fact that he wanted Mrs Dowson to have a termination, said Mr Jones. However, the prosecutor said police had discovered messages between Dowson and her husband which suggested she had not been pregnant at all and had actually been having a heavy period. Despite that, Dowson sent her victim several thousand messages over  days, at a rate of four messages per day, until she threatened suicidehe did not impregnate her, at which point he relented and they had sex four or five more times, the prosecution said. Dowson became pregnant and gave birth to a baby on November , but she was supported through her full-term by the mother of the teenager, who thought it was her grandchild. The teenaposs mum had received fake scan images from Dowson which the prosecution said had been purchased from a retailer on eBay, which allowed purchasers to add customised details such as the date of the scan, the motheraposs name and details which would be consistent with how far along the person would be. It later emerged Dowson had sent a doctored image, a DNA test result she had changed to make it say the teen was the father of her child, to the child maintenance service to try and fraudulently obtain payments from him. Police had called Dowson into Basingstoke police station for a voluntary interview in respect of the harassment claim on February  , the judge heard. Mr Jones said: The next morning, she emailed Hampshire Constabulary and alleged [the teen] raped her two years ago. Following the allegation, the teen was arrested and kept in police custody for  and a half hours for questioning. He was further interviewed under caution four times when Dowson later alleged he had been harassing her.

During the chat Harry, who is president of the QCT, said thereaposs no way the Commonwealth of  nations could progress without first coming to terms with its past and human rights legacy. He said: Certainly, when you look across the Commonwealth there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past. And I think so many people have done such an amazing, incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs. But I think we all acknowledge, on here, that there is so much more still to do.  Itaposs not going to be easy and in some cases itaposs not going to be comfortable but it needs to be done because guess what  Everybody benefits. Meghan continued: We have to, in this moment in time, say aposweaposre going to have to be a little uncomfortable right nowapos because itaposs only in pushing through that discomfort that we get to the other side of this and find the place, as youaposre pointing out, where a high tide raises all ships. Mr Neilaposs barbed comments sparked a debate with some coming to the princeaposs defence. One chimed: Are they allowed to have opinions ! Another said: Thereaposs nothing controversial in the princeaposs comments here. He and Meghan are using their public profile and connection to the British State to raise awareness and prod for change. But others agreed with Mr Neilaposs assessment and went on to accuse Harry of undermining the interests of the UK. The discussion about the Commonwealthaposs colonial history and hand in the slave trade is a subject close to Harry and Meghan. It is all the more topical given the wave of mass discontent sweeping the global about racial inequality following the death of George Lloyd at the hands of US cops. Meghan also spoke about how they had to make the time and “found it a huge honour” to speak to global leaders. Last month Harry warned the world about the issue of unconscious bias which leads to people unknowingly practising racist behaviour.

Hormone pregnancy tests linked to miscarriages and disabilities in babies should have been axed  years sooner, a review has concluded. A  report found a possible link with spina bida but the tests, including the brand Primodos, were not fully withdrawn until . It is still not known how many women used them – but the Association For Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests estimates it was around . million. In addition to spina bida, the tests are linked with limb defects, congenital heart defects and developmental and learning problems. Jo Moreno was  when she told her GP she thought she was pregnant and was given Primodos. When she had baby Nicola, her daughter had the liver of a man who had drunk rum for  years. Nicola died in  after suffering organ failure shortly after her first birthday. Jo said: The last time I nursed her I knew how ill she was and the nurse prized her from my hands as she was screaming ‘Mummy’. I could still hear her screaming that in my nightmares for decades. Jo, , from Devon, said: We orced because we couldn’t cope. He blamed me and the doctors blamed me. I felt a failure as a woman. The Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review found opportunities were missed in axing them, meaning women were exposed unnecessarily to a potential risk. Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who led the review, concluded: It is our view that from , hormone pregnancy tests should no longer have been available. We are of the view their use should have been stopped in  due to the suggestion of increased risk. Marie Lyon, chair of the Association For Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, said: I am overwhelmed that after a -year battle, Baroness Cumberlege and her team concluded the first substantive scientic report on Primodos in  was sufficient to justy withdrawal of Primodos and other HPTs from the market. In the s and early s, the NHS provided pregnancy tests – but only for women with a pressing medical need for a diagnosis. HPTs were used from  and contained synthetic versions of the hormones progesterone and estrogen.  Combinations of them are used daily by millions of women for contraception, as the pill. But campaigners said Primodos tablets were  times as strong as the pill. Charlotte Fensome, whose brother Steven has severe epilepsy, said: Every victim of Primodos is a personal tragedy. My mother was given Primodos and my brother was born with severe brain damage. It affects the whole family every day. A Bayer spokesman said: Bayer sympathises with people who struggle day to day as a result of physical disabilities.

And as scientists rush to develop one in record time to defeat the virus, surely we all wish it will arrive sooner rather than later. But that is far from the case. A YouGov poll for the Center for Countering Digital Hate, found almost a third of Brits might refuse to take a vaccine against Covid-. Of,  respondents, % said they would definitely not get vaccinated, while % said they would “probably not”. Another % said they weren’t certain. The survey has alarmed scientists, who knowa large numbers aren’t vaccinated, the virus will continue to spread. But it also shows how our modern world can facilitate the spread of lies and misinformation. So called anti-vaxxers, a small but vocal group who don’t believe in vaccinations of any kind, have long tried to push their views into the mainstream, often using social media networks to spread fear. Last year  scare stories about childhood vaccines were blamed for the UK registering more than  cases of measles, just three years after the World Health Organisation declared the country measles-free. And now anti-vaxxers appear to have taken advantage of heightened anxieties during the pandemic to disseminate fake news and conspiracy theories. And with people increasingly reliant on social media as sources of information, many  claims about Covid- took hold. According the CCDH, since the start of the pandemic .million more people in the US and UK have followed anti-vaccine pages and channels on social media. One video, entitled Plandemic, which claims the Covid- crisis was a Government set-up, has been viewed millions of times. Another post, claiming vaccines contain the same toxic chemicals as the substances used for lethal injections, warned: “The same chemical that is used to stop the heart of inmates on DEATH ROW is also in these vaccines.”  And in April the Government was forced to deny claims circulating widely online that the first volunteer in a human trial of a UK coronavirus vaccine had died. The stories about Elisa Granato were shared by several websites purporting to be news outfits. She updated her Twitter profile to explain she was “% alive”.Other posts doing the rounds claimed the vaccine would inject you with an electronic chip, allegations that billionaires like Bill Gates were making us ill for profit. Other pseudoscientic studies claim vaccines will put children in grave danger. The terrying result is that more and more people are turning against the very thing in they should put their hopes in. During protests in major cities against lockdown, many held placards decrying a vaccine, and even high-profile “influencers” and celebs have expressed concerns.In a Facebook live session, tennis player Novak Djokovic said: “I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel.”Singer MIA tweeted “If I have to choose the vaccine or chip I’m gonna choose death.” The experts say anti-vaxxers are playing with people’s lives. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organisation, said: “At WHO, we’re not just battling the virus we’re also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.” Mike Tildesley, an expert in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases and one of the Government’s SAGE group, believes lies propagated by anti-vaxxers could jeopardise the UK’s chance of eradicating coronavirus. He said: “A coronavirus vaccine can be used to achieve herd immunity. At least %will need to be immune in order for it to be achieved. “Therefore it is crucial as many as possible get vaccinated once a viable, safe vaccine is available.” So why are people giving more credence to anti-vaxxer posts  Dr Charles Kriel, a special advisor to the DCMS select committee on fake news says: “In a social media environment people tend to believe their friends and family more than institutional sources for information. “We’ve spent the last  years in the West critiquing our own institutions to the point where we’ve brought trust down, and social media makes this worse.” He also pointed to “malicious actors who are trying to amply these messages, because they add to the destabilisation of society. “We know that Putin and the Kremlin’s online operations to increase ision throughout society have increased considerably during the coronavirus. “Discouraging people from vaccinations, getting people to distrust their institutions and governments weakens us, which only strengthens them.” Gianfranco Polizzi, researcher at the LSE’s Department of Media and Communications, agrees, saying we must combat the anti-vax movement.

Landlady Jess Green said the experience had been stressful after making her way through every person who had been in the pub after lockdown eased on Saturday and pubs were allowed to open their doors once more. She told BBC Radio aposs World At One programme: The main thing that was going through our heads was we had to make sure everyone was safe, that we contacted everyone of our customers.

When asked what the experience was like, she said: Stressful - thataposs probably the only word I can use. The Lighthouse Inn was one of three pubs which opted to shut after coronavirus cases were identied among their drinkers on the weekend. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Matt Hancock heralded the trioaposs example as evidence that the test and trace system was working.

Mr Hancock told MPs the pubs were doing the right thing by their customers and by their communities. This is NHS Test and Trace working precisely as intended, he added. Three pubs shut so that others can be open. The Fox and Hounds in Batley said it would be closed until further notice after receiving a call from a customer on Monday to say they had tested positive for coronavirus.Posting on its Facebook page, it said all staff had since taken a test and added that the pub will be fully deep cleaned and when safe to do so we will reopen our doors."},{"url":null,"title":"raoul moat manhunt like being","story":"NewsRaoul Moat manhunt was like being hit by tsunami says lead detective on caseEXCLUSIVE: Neil Adamson head of Northumbria Police CID has spoken out on being at the centre of the most challenging investigation of his le ahead of the Manhunt: The Raoul Moat Story airing this weekShareCommentsByJeremy Armstrong:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video raoul-moats-chilling-telephone-warnings-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news raoul-moat-manhunt-like-being-\"\", url\"News, views and top stories .

The detective who spearheaded the biggest manhunt in UK criminal history had just come face to face with the traffic officer in hospital shortly after the shootings. In more than  years of service, Neil, now , had worked on many murder inquiries. But nothing prepared him for the sight of PC Rathband in hospital, his face swollen, peppered with gunshot wounds suffered at point-blank range in his patrol car. Moat was still on the loose and had just threatened police, saying: “I’ve just downed one of your officers. I’m not going to stop.” Neil, head of Northumbria Police CID, found himself at the centre of the most ­challenging investigation of his le, recalling: “It was like being hit with a tsunami.” But he knew David, and it is the memory of those devastating injuries – and his colleague’s bravery – which stays with him. “I went with the Chief Constable to visit David in hospital,” he said in an interview to mark the th anniversary of the manhunt. “He was in a terrible state. Sitting up in a chair at the side of his bed, his face was severely swollen and peppered with gunshot. “He was rational, sensible, brave. He asked us to catch Raoul Moat. It was a tearful, moving experience, one I shall never forget.” Neil led daily press conferences giving the latest on the search in the early days of -hour news, facing probing questions live in front of millions of viewers. Neil and I have known each since our school days. We were born and brought up in Beacon Lough, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. In later years, we went on holidays together with friends. So it was bizarre to be in the packed press conferences with Neil, a detective chief superintendent, watching him face the world’s media, and asking him questions in briefings.His experiences feature in ITV’s Manhunt: The Raoul Moat Story. Memories of the most stressful eight days of his le came flooding back during filming. It all began in the early hours of July , , with the cold-blooded murder of Chris Brown, . The karate instructor was seeing Moat’s former girlfriend Sam Stobbart, , who he also shot and wounded.  Moat, , had just been freed from prison for assaulting a child and Sam had ended their relationship – saying she was going out with a police officer in an effort to get Moat out of her le. But he was intent on bloody revenge and made for her home, sitting beneath a window, listening to her talking to Chris. “Moat was there for more than an hour,” recalls Neil. “He was texting his accomplice Karl Ness parked up nearby. Knowing Moat as she did, Sam expected a fight. “Chris actually came out of the house with a metal bar in his hand, not for one moment expecting Moat to be right outside. It was a cowardly attack, Moat shooting him twice in the back as he walked out of the house. “He shot him a third time from close range in the back of the head after he fell.” Moat had added small weights to the shotgun cartridges to cause maximum injury.After the murder of Chris, described by Neil as the tragedy’s “forgotten victim”, Moat calmly walked up to the window where Sam was phoning police, shot her in the stomach, then ran. Ness was parked nearby but, on hearing the shots, drove off, leaving Moat.  Moat later met up with Ness and another accomplice Qhuram Awan. All three travelled around the area in Awan’s black Lexus. Chris, who was not a police officer, had been caught up in Moat’s insane jealousy. Before shooting PC Rathband, Moat used a pay-as-you-go phone to call the police and say that he was “hunting for officers now”. “He parked on a slip road out of sight of PC Rathband,” said Neil. “He sneaked up and shot David twice in the face, jumped back in the Lexus and took off into Northumberland, leaving David in agony, saying ‘I’ve been shot’ as he cried out for help on the radio. A short while later Moat again called the police callously boasting of his actions.” An unprecedented police operation followed, as Moat had the “means, capability and obvious intention” of killing officers. Neil had the task of finding him. “At that stage, the threat was against police, not the public” he said. Firearms officers from across the UK were called, with experts, psychologists and even TV survival expert Ray Mears. When Awan and Ness were caught on Tuesday July , Moat ran off near Rothbury, Northumberland – a county with nearly , sq miles of wilderness.  “The operation’s scale was huge,” Neil recalled. “Then Home Secretary Theresa May wanted updates. People underestimated the vast search area. I’m sure some thought ‘he is only hiding in some bushes, why can’t they find him ’ Moat made signicant efforts to hide.“Psychological advice was important. We had to be ready to confront him and were thinking ahead, deploying negotiators. Their advice was that unless he was specially trained in living without resources in the wild, the strain would play on him and he would come out. That is exactly what happened. He lasted until the Friday.” At one stage, two bounty hunters from Sunderland were arrested. An armed operation was also carried out after helicopters picked up infrared of a body in a field. It was a sleeping drunk.  “We had  alleged sightings that week,” said Neil, a dad-of-two now retired after  years’ service. “There were reports from people who believed they had walked past Moat in Rothbury. Whether that’s true I don’t know – what we know now is we were right to stick with that search area.” I spoke with Neil at the end of those long days to offer support. “It was really hard,” he says. “I had my we worried about me being on telly with a gunman on the loose. She said ‘whathe comes after you ’ We had reports claiming he was seen in Newcastle, Berwick and even Spain. “Some people told us their sheds had been broken into and ‘they were sure it was Moat’. The pressures of the day-to-day press conference built so much. The public and media started to doubtMoat was in Rothbury, as our searching was proving fruitless. We had to hold our nerve.” Two factors underpinned the operation, which involved hundreds of officers, army personnel and search experts. There were no confirmed sightings of Moat and covert intelligence suggested he had not left the area after Awan and Ness – later jailed for a minimum of  years and  years respectively – were arrested in a swoop by armed officers. “Pressure from the media really built up,” said Neil. “But despite wanting to, I could not explain our covert intelligence.” It ended with a call on the evening of July . A colleague said: ‘‘‘Boss, we’ve got him’. My first question was, ‘is it definitely him ’” said Neil. “They replied, ‘yes – he’s in a standoff with armed officers’. My second was, ‘where is he ’ My relief was huge when they said ‘Rothbury’.” A resident – who later got a £, reward – calmly called to say: “The man you are looking for is at the bottom of the road.” Armed police moved in. “The people of Rothbury were incredibly supportive,” added Neil. Memorably, footballer Paul Gascoigne turned up with a cooked chicken and fishing rod, to try and persuade Moat to hand himself in – but was asked to leave by officers. A Taser was used to try and avert Moat’s suicide and its inventor, Peter Boatman, later took his le after it emerged the firm supplied them to police while they were still being tested.

The Dogs Trust said people should be aware of the risks of buying dogs via online adverts. The charity said demand for puppies has spiked during lockdown and it has rescued dozens of smuggled pups worth tens of thousands of pounds that were destined to be sold on to unsuspecting UK buyers. In the latest pup-smuggling bust, six young dogs were found covered in sticky oil in the back of a van at Dover port. The charity has also saved  heavily pregnant mothers, who have given birth to  puppies worth around an additional £, to cruel smugglers. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. They had been illegally imported from Romania - underage and after a journey that would have taken more than  hours - despite the coronavirus lockdown restrictions in the UK preventing non-essential travel, the charity said. Paula Boyden, the Dogs Trustaposs veterinary director, said: It is absolutely heartbreaking that we continue to see dogs being illegally imported into the country, often in terrible conditions to make huge profits for cruel puppy smugglers. We might be in the midst of a pandemic, but these devious sellers will still use every trick in the book to scam unsuspecting dog lovers.  Sadly, itaposs all too easy to be dogfished and it can be very dficult to knowyou are buying a puppy that has been smuggled. The three Maltese, two Havanese and one bichon frise pups, aged around  weeks old, were found in an appalling condition and suffering from diarrhoea. All had to be shaved to get rid of the oil and are now in the Dogs Trustaposs care and will be rehomed responsibly when they are fit and able.Ms Boyden added: We would advise you to always see a puppy with and interacting with their mum and go and see it more than once. Ask lots of questions, and ask to see vital paperwork, such as a puppy contract. If you have any doubts or it feels too good to be true, as hard as it may be, walk away and report the seller.

Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said the worst of the weather will be seen in Wales before the weekend with mm plus in some of the more exposed spots.Temperatures once again held back because of the cloud and outbreaks of rain, he continued. National Resources Wales has placed two flood alerts in place, as a result. BBC meteorologist Tomascz Schafernaker agreed Britain is going to be left particularly soggy with outbreaks of rain to hang around for  hours or so. However, he said the weekendaposs looking pretty good with lots of warm sunshine on the way - and some forecasters predict the UK could see seven days of heat next week.  Netweather weather charts show temperatures hitting C between next Sunday and July  but the forecaster has also indicated C is possible. In the meantime, Mr Schafernaker said a ribbon of cloud stretching all the way from Denmark across the UK, out in the Atlantic will bring waves of rain rippling along today. The elongated weather fronts currently cloaking Britain saw temperatures plummet in Scotland overnight, with highs of just C in the north while some of the glens were expected to drop to freezing.  However, Mr McGivern said a south westerly breeze is bringing increasingly humid air meaning much of the country will feel muggy with average temperatures of C. He said rainfall will be on and off rather than persistent but there will be some heavier outbreaks at times, particularly in southern England and South Wales. A cloudy picture, a grey and gloomy picture, he added.

What begins as a small issue over things like noise complaints or shared spaces can lead to years of passive-aggressive behaviour. And it appears one neighbour may have just sparked a Titanic battle of back and forth when it comes to their front garden. Twitter user @Chialton saw his tweet go viral after posting a photo showing the results of his neighbouraposs lawn mowing, writing: Next door with top class grass banter. In the image, the lawn in front of the two neighbouring properties has been cut on one side, creating a perfect line in the grass where the drainpipe separates the two homes - and leaving behind a measly patch of uncut grass no more than a metre wide on one side. The post racked up more than , likes and ided opinion, with some slamming it as petty while others argued they saw no issue. The user who uploaded the photo hilariously added: Decided Iaposm going to leave it, when their grass grows back Iaposll mow mine. I will like this game. One reply labelled it   for pettiness and plenty of people came back with their own suggestions of how to take revenge. Never cut that piece of grass, ever. Let it become a jungle, one comment read. A second said: You need to knock and seeyou can borrow his lawn mower.  Another added: Put a string line from wall square of house which will show he has cut part of yours. Then note through door saying please do the cut my grass again. But some people argued they would have done the same, as one replied: Not sure why you expect them to do it  I get itaposs just a bit, but itaposs still yours. While another person joked: Heaposs probably going to the shop at some point, do you just wanna give him your list  ,,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

At the start of the short clip you hear the boyaposs mum ask: Who do you think weaposre meeting  None-the-wiser, her little boy replies: I donapost know. When he first spots who he thinks is his best friend, he seems puzzled, unsure that what he is seeing is real.  Before he recognises him and starts running towards him shouting William. Overcome by emotion the two boys hug each other and jump up and down, shocked by the surprise.

Taking to TikTok, the woman explained how she avoids wasting unnecessary time washing the goods by hand, instead opting to put them in the dishwasher for a quick cycle - and we have to admit itaposs pretty unique. To the top tray she lines up fruit like apples, kiwis, grapes, and avocados. And to the bottom shelf she adds raspberries, tomatoes and blueberries - separated by plastic trays - pineapple, melon alongside a few other items. Then she adds around a cap ful of distilled white vinegar to the opening where you would usually add your detergent. Before selecting a light setting and pressing start on the machine. Then before you know it, the cycle is complete and everything has been given a good old rinse. For a few of these items, this might be considered a waste of time as the skin they still have the skin on  - which you wouldnapost eat anway.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being.

But seeing how our wee community comes together in times of need is always inspiring.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next.

Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown.

Ireland, after all, is still in the EUrsquos single market .It gets worse.

Of course, in the face of Covid-, people may, in some ways, become keener on harder borders. But how the politics of that works out is going to be interesting indeed.The shimmering illusion of Johnsonrsquos global Britain was always likely to be swept away by the realities of Brexit combined with todayrsquos fractious geopolitics and trade wars. Covid- adds a whole new dynamic to that at home as much as abroad.Brexitrsquos impact on the independence debate has been rather mixed. Two-thirds of Scottish voters would rather be in the EU than out on the continentrsquos margins. But independence in the EU, with the rest of the UK on its \"global Britain\" path, would mean a harder border with England and Wales.Itrsquos not only a choice between two unions itrsquos a choice between two borders. Brexit creates a harder border with the EU independence would remove that again while putting customs and regulatory checks on the England-Scotland border that Johnson thinks doesnrsquot exist.The border question has always looked tricky for the pro-independence case. Scotlandrsquos trade with the rest of the UK is three times that with the EU. And yes, it is contradictory for Conservatives to proclaimthe economic benefits of borders with the EU while decrying the economic harm of borders with independence.

It also shows that, in the general population in England, support for independence is at %, which is interesting because thatrsquos broadly where support for Scottish independence was in Scotland  years ago. In other words, this could be the beginning of a new trend in England, who knows.In other ways, the poll is only confirming what we know already: the highest support for nationalism and independence in England comes from voters who lean to the right whereas in Scotland, it generally comes from the left. But that doesnrsquot mean wersquore dealing with completely dferent beasts here. Far from it: there are striking similarities between the instincts of some English Tories and Scottish nationalists and they help explain two things: why the parties behave as they do, and why there is a large group of voters they struggle to reach.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeIn the case of the Conservative Party, English Tories ndash like Scottish nationalists ndash have always possessed a strong sense of national identity, sometimes romantic, sometimes bellicose. At party conferences, Tories are unselfconscious about bellowing out Land of Hope and Glory in the way that Scottish nationalists are unselfconscious about Flower of Scotland. The leaders of the Tory party have also always known the power of English iconography ndash Stanley Baldwin used to talk about ldquothe tinkle of the hammer on the anvil and the call of the corncrake on a dewy morning ndash just as SNP leaders know the power, for some, of tartan and bagpipes.Politically, Tory leaders ndash again, like leaders of the SNP ndash have also always been aware of the usefulness of national identity . Disraeli said he had ldquoalways considered that the Tory party was the national party of England and a few years later leading Tories set up the Patriotic Association with a weekly paper called ldquoEngland. Some  years later, Boris Johnson tapped into exactly the same English patriotism to fuel support for the campaign to leave the European Union just as the SNP taps into Scottish patriotism to fuel support for leaving the UK.The leadership of both the Tories and the SNP are also aware of the trick, because it works for some people, of using national identity to denigrate their opponents as un-English, un-Scottish, un-patriotic or un-something . Disraeli said Liberalismrsquos aim was to ldquoeffect the disintegration of the Empire of England whereas the leadership of the SNP frequently accuse their opponents of failing to stand up for Scotland or doing it down. Itrsquos all the same kind of stuff really, whether itrsquos English or Scottish or British: nationalism as a stirrer of intense passions and a political recruiter.But it only goes so far, because not everyone is stirred by nationalistic sentiments: some hearts soar but some hearts sink, and that poses a problem for politicians of a nationalistic bent. Strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have always been unattractive to many liberals and voters who occupy the crucial centre ground ndash the kind that the SNP in particular needs to recruit. More recently, some of the more liberal Tory leaders have also struggled in  for example, Alex Salmond showed no shame or embarrassment in his patriotism and nationalism, while for David Cameron it was all a bit squirmy and awkward.Whatrsquos happening is that all of this creates issues for centrist politicians who oppose nationalism, like Cameron in  or Keir Starmer in , particularly when, in all its forms, nationalism appears to be on the rise. However, it also poses problems for English Tories and Scottish nationalists who seek to exploit it ndash and it may explain why support for Brexit and Scottish independence both hover around % but not much higher.Take Nicola Sturgeon for example. She knows that sounding stridently nationalistic will attract some Scots to her cause but she also knows that sounding too nationalistic could turn off the centrists she needs to win over. Keir Starmer has a similar problem for Labour, only in a dferent direction. He knows that sounding more obviously patriotic could win back some of the support from English nationalists whorsquove gone over to the Tories, particularly in the north of England, but he also knows thathe goes too far, he risks losing support from centrists, particularly in London and, crucially, Scotland.To make matters worse in Scotland, therersquos another problem here, which is that English nationalism may also be fuelling Scottish nationalism or at least support for the SNP. The most recent poll at the weekend confirms support for independence at around % and support for the SNP high enough to win them another election, and much of this has been fuelled by Brexit which in turn has been fuelled by English nationalism.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe question is how resilient the centre will be in the face of all of this. Clearly, some of the centre ground in Scotland is being eaten away by the SNP, and in a UK context itrsquos left Labour in particular with a dilemma. On English nationalism, one of the solutions that the partyrsquos election review considers is tacking to the centre on economic policy while talking up the partyrsquos patriotic credentials the push and pull of nationalism and unionism is also the reason Labour has been talking about the idea of ldquoradical federalism.But will it be enough  The fear for centrists must be that as English nationalism closes in on one side and Scottish nationalism closes in on the other, like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars, the centre will get squished. In a constitutionally eccentric country like the UK, itrsquos also unclear what the centrists can do. One option is to sound more nationalistic, but that may hasten the crushing. The other is to continue to call for another way. But as the walls close in, they may not be heard over the noise.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

Nationality, for me, evokes contentedness, at best, rather than pride. I canrsquot get excited about which flags fly on buildings, what colour my passport is, or whether a copy of The Gruffalo is available in Scots. Indeed, I find the all-too-prevalent Scottish and British exceptionalism cringeworthy and insular, especially in those areas where we claim world-leading status when all the sensible evidence points to the contrary.Although I would have been prepared to vote Yes, I voted No in  based solely on my view that Scotlandrsquos inherited fiscal deficit combined with the leftism of a new, ideologised nation would leave me and my family poorer for a signicant period of time.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe  campaign made me feel that a Yes vote would be an act of personal self-harm a virtue signalling affirmation of non-Englishness. The stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment it was not.That said, polling trends are now clear enough to be sure that, slowly but most definitely surely, the country is moving towards independence. From the : position of , the No vote has gradually declined. Evenwe strip out polling during the pandemic, which may fairly be seen to be skewed by a seismic current event, numbers for No now normally tend to be in the low rather than the mid-fties.Since the peak of coronavirus passed, Yes has begun to build what may be seen as a psephologically consistent lead. This particular set of warning signs for unionistswere there in the polling conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC in May, in which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was given a net approval rating of % for her handling of the pandemic. Only one-in-eight people thought she was doing badly.That means, plainly, that a large number of died-in-the-wool unionists thought that Ms Sturgeon was doing a good job. As soon as I saw that poll I wondered whether unionist leaders north and south, who have long hitched their wagon to the negative perceptions of Ms Sturgeon that they claim to hear on the famous doorsteps, would understand the potential implications of their people offering her their approval, even during a crisis.The question in my head, now, is this: have the unionists given up, or are they just asleep at the wheel To be sure, positives for nationalists are plentul. Simple demographics play their part bluntly, young people are more likely to be ideological nationalists, and unionists are more likely to die. Secondly, without being pejorative about Boris Johnson, on whom the jury remains out, the very presence in Downing Street of a figure largely unpopular in Scotland also helps the case, especially when he and his partyrsquos demise still seems distant. And, thirdly, the uncertainty ushered in by Brexit, in a nation which did not vote for it, is another push factor for soft unionist Remainers.However it would also be a mistake to think that this most recent trend towards nationalism is particularly sticky. Ms Sturgeonrsquos communications around coronavirus has been as outstanding as it must have been exhausting, but her strategy has so far been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos.During a crisis, opinions are transient and often frankly hysterical. So all should not be lost for unionists. And, yet, their prospects look bleak. Bleak not because of the last two months, or even the last two years, but as a result of decades of poor strategy, guided by emotional anti-nationalism rather than calm, clinical calculation.One word sums up British unionism: ldquoreactive. The Smith Commission was a reaction to the independence referendum result. The Calman Commission was a reaction to the SNP winning in . Devolution itself was a reaction to nationalist strength.Unionism is forever chasing the curve of Scottish public opinion. It is never ahead of it. It is never proactive. If it wants to save itself, it now needs to be. If unionists think they can just say no to indyref  and eventually it will all go away, theyrsquove not been paying attention.Unionism has some strong fundamentals in its favour. Firstly, it may well be the case that at any future independence referendum voter fatigue plays a signicant role. Scots have, in six years, been asked to decide upon their future in the UK and their future in the EU, have faced three general elections and a Scottish election, with another around the corner, not to mention enduring the coronavirus crisis, during which their job has a good chance of having been saved by a UK Chancellor. They might simply think ldquoenough is enough.That is, perhaps, rather a depressing reason to vote No. But there are more uplting ones. The transfer of such large volumes of No voters to Yes over recent years means that, by definition, a large proportion of the vote is soft. It can go back under the right conditions.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeThose right conditions, I think, inevitably involve the proactive creation of a New Unionism, discussed in some quarters but not so far ostensibly embraced by anyone with their hands on the levers of power.This New Unionism would read the changing mood, not just in Scotland but also in Northern Ireland and even to a degree in Wales, and try to get ahead of it. It would almost certainly move beyond the immature unionist debate which presumes power to be binary, either shting from Westminster to Holyrood or vice versa, either a strong Scotland or a strong Britain, and instead enhance the role of both parliaments and governments through a structure built to last for decades, rather than one built to last until the next time the SNP does well at an election.When you ask two unionists how to defeat nationalism you get five dferent answers. Unless they settle on a New Unionism in short order, they will probably still be arguing with each other when the independence train leaves the station.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-stuart-waiton-keir-starmer-channels-new-mccarthyism","story":"McCarthyism was a form of terror that used unsubstantiated evidence, fear and threats to destroy potentially anyone, especially those in the entertainment industry, who were seen as left wing. The inquisitorial question, ldquoAre you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, has gone down in history as a chilling expression and reminder of the dangers of right-wing political panics.Today, we find the so-called left, in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, being sacked, McCarthy style, by Labour leader Keir Starmer, for daring to retweet a newspaper interview with the actor Maxine Peake that had in it a crass and inaccurate reference to Israeli security forces training US police to use the kneeling tactics which killed George Floyd.The irony, of course, is that this sacking does not come with rants about communist atheism, a defence of Christian mortality, ideas of treachery or the lack of loyalty to the nation. It is not a right-wing sacking but an all too familiar ldquoprogressive sacking.It is unlikely that Starmer thinks Long Bailey is actually anti-Semitic and many have suggested this is an opportunistic move on the Labour leaderrsquos behalf to clear out some of the Corbyn supporters in his shadow cabinet. The problem being, of course, that in so doing he is simply applying the modern McCarthyite approach that has been developed by the ldquoleft when dealing with those with whom they disagree.McCarthy and his ilk hated the liberal and left-wing progressives that they saw as dominating the entertainment industry, the luvvies who transgressed from American patriotism and Christian morality. Today, this too has changed, and it is often the cultural elite, the left-luvvies, who are the most ldquoright-thinking, censorious and keen to demand that people be ldquocancelled.Just ask Lawrence Fox, the actor who has been blacklisted for questioning the idea of ldquowhite privilege. Fox fears he may never get another acting job he may well be right.Until relatively recently it was only the most small-minded of bigots who thought it acceptable to sack people because of their ldquoimmoral opinions.

By day, the subject of this BBC Scotland documentary managed people and projects in the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen. By night she went into a boxing ring and prepared to pummel an opponent into submission.As in all the best boxing tales, Fraser had a backstory. She started boxing at , and when the Commonwealth Games came to Glasgow her record was such that she should have been a shoo-in for selection to represent her country. But the Scottish Boxing Association instead chose  men and no women. England sent three women, including Nicola Adams, the Olympic and world champion.Not being selected was ldquothe biggest slap in the face Irsquove ever experienced, said Fraser. So she decided to turn pro, the first woman boxer in Scotland to do so, and set about achieving her next goal: becoming a world champion.As motivation goes, woman athlete snubbed by male sporting authorities was okay, but it was not exactly up there with Rocky taking on the might of the Soviet Union , to avenge his friendrsquos death. Or Apollo Creedrsquos son surfacing  years later to do the same for dear old dad.No one would expect real le to match the movies for thrills. Sporting documentaries, though, have become a brutally competitive field. There will never be another When We Were Kings, but a quick glance at Netflix shows some are at least aiming to hit that weight, be it in boxing or basketball .In The Boxer, it seemed at times as though the filmmakers were trying to make a virtue out of how ordinary Fraser was, a risky gambit. If she was so unremarkable, so nice woman next door, why bother spending an hour getting to know her She had certainly had her battles to fight, as a woman, and a gay woman, in a male-dominated sport and society. She touched on those, and her faith, but never lingered for long.Maybe there was no more to it. If there was we did not hear much about it. Where did all that necessary aggression come from  Why did she say ldquoBoxers arenrsquot nice people  What about her childhood, growing up, coming out  What did it feel like to be punched in the face for the first time There seemed to be no-one on the other side of the camera asking questions, meaning all we were left with, other than Fraserrsquos assertions, were the views of her we, Kirsty, and her coach, Davie.Come to think of it, why no word from the boxing authorities on why she had not been selected for Glasgow In the absence of a deep dig we were left with lots of scenes of Fraser training, at work, home, and so on. The glimpse behind the scenes at the bouts were intermittently engaging. ldquoMay the best girl win, said one referee, showing there is some ways to go in making the world of boxing ldquowoke.The hour came alive, though, when we saw Fraser fighting, and when it emerged she and Kirsty were having a baby. This was more like it ndash a great story, boxer felled by love for a baby, and the scenes at home with the three of them were wonderful, telling us in a glance here and a gesture there how much this had changed everything.With the clock running down it seemed asthe tale was going to stop there. There was one last attempt at injecting drama when Fraser injured her knee , but Davie was working hard trying to line up a world title fight.Then came the ultimate below the belt blow: Covid- arrived, and the world, sporting and otherwise, was shut down. It was less a big bang ending than a slow fizzle, but Fraser promised she would keep going. ldquoI was made to be a world champion. Thatrsquos who I am, she said. Even though the hour had revealed not that much about her other than what she chose to disclose, I believed her."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  There is method to the madness of spend  spend  spend","story":"Advocates include Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the economist Stephanie Kelton and the Labour-supporting tax specialist Richard Murphy.

This is exactly the kind of approach needed, learning the lessons of what worked in the financial crisis.She added: ldquo It is crucial that these jobs are created quickly, with local authorities crucial in making that happen at anything like the scale the Government intends.ldquo, new jobs would be three times as many as were created following the financial crisis, so delivery on this scale will be a huge challenge.Meanwhile, the Chancellor faced urgent calls to extend the furlough scheme and give greater fiscal powers to devolved administrations ahead of his summer statement.Economists have warned that his pre-announced plans, including a freeze on stamp duty, will not help the country recover and suggest he may need to borrow up to poundbn.Analysis by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchhas found thatthe furlough scheme is not extended beyond October, it could cause a permanent loss of poundbn in GDP - around pound per person.Garry Young, Deputy Director for Macroeconomics at NIESR said: \"The justication for keeping fiscal support measures going is that it makes economic sense. Premature withdrawal of the measures could mean that the long-term adverse impact on the public finances ends up being worse than the cost of continued short-term support.ldquoProbably the most important policy measure the Chancellor could take would be to bring forward spending promised as part of the governmentrsquos levelling up agenda. In his March budget, the Chancellor announced plans for substantial additional public investment. It is dficult to think of a better time than now for the government to invest more.:Slanj reports lsquotsunami of salesrsquo after Nicola Sturgeon wears their face mask\"This would increase demand in the UK economy and provide support when it is most needed.Anneliese Dodds, Labours shadow chancellor accused the Mr Sunak of not going far enough with his jobs-boosting plans, and said the scheme had been inspired by Labours Future Jobs Fund implemented following the  financial crash.Ms Dodds said: \"Labour has repeatedly called on the government to match the ambitions of Labours Future Jobs Fund, to rise to the youth unemployment challenge. To the extent that the Kickstart programme is based on the Future Jobs Fund model, it should help many young people to access work.ldquoHowever, the Government are yet to rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis. The urgent priority right now is to prevent additional unnecessary unemployment in the first place by abandoning the Governments one-size-fits-all approach to the removal of the Job Retention and Self-Employed schemes. In addition, older people who become unemployed, and those living in particularly hard-hit areas, will also need tailored support.ldquoGovernment also urgently needs to get test, track and isolate right, as ultimately the biggest drag on our economy has been the slow public health response, which threatens additional localised lockdowns and which has reduced consumer confidence."},{"url":null,"title":"eu-open-independent-scotland-re-joining","story":"Kirsty Hughes, who was the director of the Scottish Centre on Europe Relations , said the issue of an independent Scotland joining the EU was a completely dferent question to whether the UK could ever be allowed back in.If Scots voted for independence in a legally binding referendum, she forecast there would be \"complete openness\" from the  EU nations to allowing entry.Speaking at a webinar organised by the European Movement in Scotland, she said: \"On the Scottish side I think there is complete opennessScotland was to vote Yes in a constitutionally and legally valid referendum.\"There is complete openness to welcoming another small, northern European country into the European Union.\"She said this would not be the case\"there is a big stand-off over a referendum between London and Edinburgh\".But she added that not only was Scotland seen as pro-European, given the vote to remain in the EU in , she said that its \"politics looks more normal at the moment\".The expert added: \"Frankly any big country applying to join the EU, whether it is Turkey or Ukraine or the UK, is always much more problematic usually than a smaller country.\"Speaking about the UKs prospects for rejoining, she noted that politicians in Europe had been left feeling \"disappointed, upset, angry and many other things at the Brexit vote\".She continued: \"I think the EU would be very reluctant in the near future to welcome a penitent UK back.\"It would have to be more than penitent, it would have to be one that had clearly worked through all its political, democratic, constitutional problems and come out the other side of that.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7357607.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gay-scots-mp-says-first-male-footballer-come-stands-gain-an-absolute-fortune","story":"SNPs John Nicolson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, said it was \"shocking in the st century\" that gay footballers do not feel supported enough to express what their sexuality is and condemned football administrators for not doing enough.Retired footballer Thomas Beattie, formerly with Hull City of the Championship, the second tier of English league football, came out publicly as gay last month. He has said he believes fans are the reason why no current professionals have come out as gay.He became the first male English footballer to come out since Justin Fashanu in . Mr Fashanu came out while still playing top flight professional football in the US. He would laterto the UK to play for Torquay United, Airdrie and Hearts.Justin FashanuOther international players such as Robbie Rogers and Thomas Hitzlsperger only came out after retiring from British football.In stark contrast to the menrsquos game, womens football has many role models.

It is that footballers are frightened. It is fear that stops them from coming out.\"I have a friend who is an agent and he told me the first gay footballer would make an absolute fortune because big companies would want to be associated with the first footballer to come out. Financially it would be very lucrative for that footballer.\"I suspect it is the fear that they are going to be harassed online and they might not feel safe walking in the street in certain communities and that they would have a target on their back as the first person to person to come out.\"That really is shocking in the st century. \"What seems to me, speaking as a gay man myself, is that footballers are in an enormously privileged position. The high profile ones are very wealthy, they can protect themselves from immediate physical danger. Andthey are too scared to come out, what does that say to kids living up and down the country, who look at them and say thathe doesnt feel safe coming out, what hope is there for me in my housing scheme, or estate. That is the real worry about this.Magdalena Eriksson\"I feel we have been talking about this for years. When I was on this select committee in , and recommended a homophobia in sport inquiry which we did, there were no gay footballers out and here we are five years on and there are still no gay footballers out.\"I dont detect urgency in football administration to change this. I dont recognise a concern about this.:Mark Smith -I know there are gay footballers in Scotland because I tried to convince one to go public\"There is some concern but it doesnt seem to be a pressing concern.\"The SNP MP said that Richard Masters, chief executive of the English Premier League had told MPs that footballers that came out would be embraced by the game which he said was a far more welcoming place in . But he also conceded that it was a failure in the game that a player had not felt able to do so.But Mr Nicolson said: \"I dont have any sense at all that it is a far more welcoming place. By definition,it was a far more welcoming place, people would feel free to come out.\"His commentary came in a discussion with Paul Cleal, an adviser to several relevant organisations including the Premier League who told him that mens football was \"not welcoming enough\"He believed football was more concerned about behaviour of people in the stadia and social media, which he said was \"a shame\".An English Football Association spokesman said: \"Coming out, irrespective of gender, is an inidual and personal decision. Having a support network and allies, whether thatrsquos teammates, friends or family, can be crucial in this process and we will always offer the full support of The FA to anybody that chooses to come out.\"We continue to work with our partners across the game, such as Stonewall, LGBT fan groups, campaign groups and the leagues, to help create a safe and comfortable environment for any player to come outthey wish to do so.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

She is currently volunteering with Skye Community Response and helping to fundraise for the Centre of Resilience in Bihar in India, among other projects.Layla worked with the directors of the Centre of Resilience # Kumar Prashant and Benjamin Reid-Howells # last summer and spent three months in India last winter.During that time she visited the centre which is in the fourth poorest state in India, Bihar.Bihar was historically the educational epicentre of India, however, it suffers from floods and droughts, cases of extreme poverty, and wide-spread disease # but people, like Kumar Prashant, are working tirelessly to elevate this state out of poverty.Kumar Prashant travelled with his friend Ben from India to Scotland by motorcycle helping multiple humanitarian initiatives along the way. The motorcycle journey took them  years. As one of the very first projects, before leaving India, they built a self-sustainable house together entirely from waste.Kumar is now living in this house and working with the local population to create grassroots projects that can provide jobs, and a steady income, to people in the surrounding village.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair #

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This is entirely within the Education Minister#s remit, and to not consider alternatives as a matter of urgency is both negligent and unfair.Mr Lyttle, her Alliance colleague and education committee chairman, said Mr Weir#s refusal was surprising and unacceptable, and should be reversed.This year#s post-primary transfer tests have been delayed by two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.The parents of two children in Northern Ireland have won High Court permission to challenge decisions to delay the tests.Their lawyers argued last month that the decision to delay by a matter of weeks amid so much disruption to their education is unlawful.Meanwhile, a number of Catholic grammars and an integrated school have said they will not use transfer test results to admit pupils in .Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe dad: The son I never metFor sale!

A Ulster University graduate, Shawn said that he is now planning to treat his family with his windfall.He purchased some scratchcards at the end of a sht which led him to buying his winning card.It all started when I bought a couple of £ scratchcards on the Friday night, explained Shawn. I won £ on those so, as I was leaving work around .pm on Saturday evening, I bought a couple of £ scratchcards with my winnings.It was only when Shawn arrived home and was preparing to get ready for a socially distanced garden party with friends that he remembered he had the scratchcards in his jacket.He said he could not believe it when he discovered the numbers on one of the cards matched, and he had won the top prize of £m.At first I thought it must be a fake card and I checked every inch of it to make sure it was real, continued Shawn.I ran through the details with a lovely lady on the end of the phone before she said the magic words… #Congratulations, you#ve won a million pounds#, he recalled.I really couldn#t believe what I was hearing. I was still trying to process what was happening while my mum was already making plans for a new asphalt driveway at the front of the house, which they#ve been working on. Then she phoned my brother Paul in England and I texted my brother Gavin in Australia - both of whom naturally thought we were joking, he laughed.Shawn, however, was soon brought back down to earth after he received a phone call from the store assistant who had earlier sold him the winning scratchcard.The call came through and immediately I thought this was it - I#d been the victim of an elaborate prank, said Shawn. But it turned out there was just a problem with the fridge in the shop so I had to go round and fix it, knowing that I#d literally just won a million.Despite his new millionaire status, Shawn says that he will continue to work at McNicholl#s Eurospar. As well as a new driveway and shed for his mum, and treating the rest of his family, he wants to buy a Range Rover and go on a holiday abroad.Shawn said customers have been popping into the store to congratulate him since news of his win broke locally.It#s crazy, because it#s only been a matter of weeks since I was chatting to customers about Robert Fullerton from Castledawson who won £, on a scratchcard in May, he added.We were just saying how amazing it would be to win that sort of money. Now here I am, just two months later, having won a million quid. It just goes to show that anyone can win it at any time. I just feel lucky and blessed that on this occasion, it was my turn.

Just some of the hair mishaps stylists will have to tackle after over  days of closure. On Monday, normally a day of rest for the hair and beauty industry, the latest easing of restrictions meant demand for a post-lockdown top-to-toe transformation was sky high. And judging by the volume of phone calls and messages from clients scrambling to get an appointment, salons are set for a busy few weeks.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadStephen Hamilton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBen Magowan has his hair cut at Shankeys on Belfast’s Lisburn RoadAs well as hairdressers and barbers, beauty salons and tattoo parlours were also back in business. Belfast#s Lisburn Road was a hive of activity as men seeking urgent restyles queued up outside the numerous barber shops dotted across both sides of the thoroughfare. Despite cups of coffee and glossy magazines being out, and facemasks, hand sanitiser and Perspex screens in, salons have been booked out weeks in advance.At Andrew Watson Hairdressing, Una Calvert from east Belfast was sitting comfortably in front of the mirror for her first cut and colour since January. You have no idea how long I#ve waited for this day. I have been tempted to put all sorts of things in my hair but I#ve stayed away from home dye, she said. Apart from trimming my fringe, I leave it all to the experts. Once I heard when salons could reopen I was straight on the phone to Andrew and I#m so delighted to be here on the first day back.As a long-time client Una said she had absolutely no qualms about coming back in. Andrew is an excellent hairdresser and always reliable, so I had every confidence that everything would be in place.At this stage I just want to leave with a nice hairstyle. PPE-clad Andrew was equally excited to be back despite facing the prospect of an -hour working week to tackle the backlog.At first it felt like the first day at school with some nervousness but soon it was as though we#d never been away, he laughed.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

It was revealed recently that just over % of all vehicles using the Pennyburn dump in Derry are from the Republic. Concern had been raised that local ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. googletag.cmd.push The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed yesterday at a special meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a working group be set up to look at the issue of vehicles from the Republic using the local recycling centres. This was backed by all other parties on the council apart from Sinn Fein. In a report prepared for yesterdays meeting, it was stated that additional staff would be neededthe council was to monitor vehicles using the recycling centres. The report stated: More recently Members asked that officers consider the implications of a policy that restricts access to recycling sites to those that reside within the Council area only. This would place an additional resource burden on the service in that staff will have to check the residency details of all those entering sites right across the district. Several of the sites operate with a single member of staff, who needs to supervise the disposal of materials and assist those using the site, therefore additional staff would be required at these facilities to ensure compliance.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.

Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.

traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football and Hurling

His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

The former linen warehouse on the Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complexBelfast City Council has long had a contradictory attitude to the city’s built heritage.It boasts that Belfast’s streetscape is “a veritable storybook to rival any city in the UK or Ireland” while simultaneously allowing the removal of numerous pages through its support for developer-led regeneration.The problem with this approach is that it inevitably leads to the type of clash between heritage and commerce now faced by the council in relation to former Ulster Televisionheadquarters at Havelock House.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...An exterior picture of Havelock House, UTV, in , six years after the first broadcast from the studio there in Halloween The former linen warehouse on Belfast’s Ormeau Road is one of Northern Ireland’s best-known cultural landmarks yet faces demolition to make way for a high-density apartment complex. The proposal from Olympian Homes is highly likely to succeed because the failings of our planning system have allowed the developer and the council to maintain the legal fiction that the building has no heritage value.This position isn’t even remotely credible, given Havelock House’s integral role in the birth of Northern Ireland’s television industry, its indelible association with legendary local series such as Teatime with Tommy, Romper Room, Good Evening Ulster and Kelly and its status as the last surviving small station from the pioneering days of UK television.Features such as the original UTV studio, designed by local architect Brian Hewitt, are literally the nation’s last built record of the earliest days of television in regions such as Northern Ireland.The Queen meets UTV broadcasters including Paul Clarke during her visit to Havelock House as they launch their new HD station there in . Pic Colm Lenaghan PacemakerBut, despite its clear historical importance, nobody seems willing to protect a building which occupies a prime development site.There are two forms of protection available: full listed status, which can only be granted by the Department for Communities , and heritage asset status, which could be granted by Belfast City Council.The DfC has decided that Havelock House does not meet the criteria for a listing survey, the first step in the listing process. It reached this decision on the basis of a brief inspection of the building by officials in . Studio  inside Havelock House in the s with guests including Frank Carson, Gloria Hunnord and Rev David BurkeThe rationale behind its decision was never fully recorded. The fragments available suggest that the officials were not familiar with television architecture, leading them to make several inadvertent but decisive misinterpretations. The DfC has been aware of this issue for  months yet has remains unwilling to review its decision.Eventhere were a review, it is unlikely the DfC’s decision will change because its listing criteria are dominated by aesthetic considerations. This is exemplied by the protected status of the BBC’s Broadcasting House, which is an attractive building devoid of internal historical fabric. Dr Ken Grfin, a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster TelevisionBy contrast, the DfC seems relaxed about the possible loss of Havelock House, a less attractive building with unique historical architecture.The absence of listed building status isn’t necessarily an issue because local authorities can designate heritage assets, buildings which don’t meet the national listing criteria but should still be protected on cultural and historical grounds.This author has been unable to find any instance where Belfast City Council has used this power. It’s also unlikely to do so in the future because its current draft development plan indicates that only listed buildings qualy as heritage assets, which defeats the purpose of that designation.The authorities’ inaction has not just left Havelock House exposed to demolition but it has reduced the public’s ability to scrutinise Olympian Homes’ demolition proposal. Without protection, the developers and Belfast’s planners have been able to maintain the fiction that Havelock House is a building devoid of historical value. This has allowed Olympian to submit a heritage statement which does not consider the historical or cultural impact of the building’s demolition. This is entirely legitimate as such statements are not required to disclose a development’s impact on unprotected structures.It has also allowed the developers to avoid the type of public consultation normally triggered by planning applications which entail the demolition of historically signicant buildings. Due to Havelock House’s unlisted status, Olympian could conduct a minimalistic consultation. It is impossible to assess the nature of Olympian’s consultation because the developer seems to have omitted its consultation report from its planning application. But it seems to have been poorly advertised – this author only became aware of the proposal by accident while, despite the development’s size, only a handful of objections have been received by the council to date.The developer’s decision to name its development ‘Havelock House’ in spite of the intended demolition of the eponymous building also seems to have sown confusion. My personal experience is that many people assume that the historic television station would be retained as part of the development.The affair of Havelock House might seem extraordinary but the sad fact is that such scenarios are not uncommon in our planning system.This has had a corrosive impact on public faith in the planning system: last month, a survey by Queen’s University found that % of people believe that Northern Ireland’s planning system does not serve the public interest.Barring a miracle, events on Belfast’s Ormeau Road are likely to only reinforce this view.• Dr Ken Grfin is a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster Television.

It just goes to show that anyone can win it at any time. “I just feel lucky and blessed that on this occasion, it was my turn,” concluded Shawn. Due to social distancing guidelines, Shawn is planning a bigger celebration when the time is right. Shawn bought the winning National Lottery ‘£M Mega Cash Showdown’ Scratchcard from McNicholl’s Eurospar store at  Station Road, Dungiven, BT LN.The card costs £ and offers a  in . overall chance of winning a prize, with prizes ranging from £ up to the top prize of £,,.Thanks to National Lottery players, up to £M is being used to support charities and organisations affected by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak across the arts, community and charity, heritage, education, environment and sport sectors.This includes up to £M in funding support from the National Lottery Community Fund which will be used over the next six months to help groups best placed to support people and communities through the crisis - from helping support food banks to causes that combat loneliness and isolation, support for the elderly and projects that aid health in the community.By playing The National Lottery, an average of £M is raised every week by National Lottery players for projects big and small across the country. --A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adeadafdade   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdaddbfba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
