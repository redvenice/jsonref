Katherine Rundell on how the best of them can ignite the imagination of all readers, whatever their ageI have been writing children’s fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it it is a slippery, various, quicksilver thing. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it is not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people, myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book has to satisfy two distinct but connected appetites.My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgments of fear, love, failure. So what I try for when I write – failing often, but trying – is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember.Those of us who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return.When you read a children’s book, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it’s at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others, the condition precedent of love itself. For that we need books that are specifically written to give the heart and mind a galvanic kick – children’s books. Children’s fiction necessitates distillation at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children’s books as literary vodka.Above all, children’s fiction spoke to me, and still speaks to me, of hope. The books say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and sexy Jesus lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children’s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I hope that they are.WH Auden wrote, in an essay on Lewis Carroll: “There are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.” I would not suggest that adults read only, or even primarily, children’s fiction. Just that there are some times in life when it might be the only thing that will do.The Paddington books by Michael Bond There’s a vivid and obvious lesson in Paddington, about refuge. Paddington turns up at our door, with nothing to commend himself but his existence and his excellent hat, and we must take him in. We must cherish him, because he lives – and Michael Bond is telling us, like William Blake before him, that everything that lives is holy.But there’s more: for Bond, I think, structure is a form of metaphor, and the stories can be read as parables. So each inidual Paddington story usually has some kind of mishap: for instance, Paddington drops a sandwich a man slips on it. Disaster! But then the man proves to be a burglar, and his stolen goods spill out at the bear’s feet: triumph! The books tell us that if we zoom out we will see that inside each disaster there is a cog, propelling us towards potential goodness. Baked into the structure of the stories, small as they are, is Bond’s colossal central truth: larger than the world’s chaos are its miracles. Paddington asks us to trust, if only for a brief gasp, for the length of the book, in the world’s essential nobility. The books are oxygen for those, like me, who doubt.His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip PullmanLyra, Pullman’s ferocious heroine, one of the greatest ever written, a girl with quick wit and tooth-and-claw loyalty and a loose hand with the truth, voyages to the underworld. At first, on meeting the harpies who guard the realm of the dead, she lies – tells them what she thinks they want to hear. The harpies go for her, e‑bombing her and scraping at her skull with their talons. And so instead, she tells her own story: about pain, loss, hope and grubbiness, love and mistakes. The harpies listen. Lyra’s companion asks why they did not attack, this time: “‘Because it was true,’ said No‑Name. ‘Because she spoke the truth. Because it was nourishing. Because it was feeding us. Because we couldn’t help it. Because it was true.’”The harpies make a bargain: if each soul has paid heed to the world and has a story to tell of it, and they tell it truly, they will be led through the darkness to the other side. Rigorous attention, wakefulness to the world’s beauty, for Pullman, is what life demands of us. He has that in common with the philosopher Iris Murdoch, another writer I love, who decreed that attention was the foundation stone of love. We must learn, in Pullman’s universe, to watch the world with intense and generous care. We must learn to tell stories, his books say, whether it comes naturally or not – because it is the best and sometimes the only way we have to exchange truth.Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak“But the wild things cried, ‘Oh please don’t go – we’ll eat you up – we love you so!’“The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye.”There are as many interpretations of Where the Wild Things Are as there are people who have read it, and it means something very different when you are 30 from what it meant when you were three. I think it’s about the ferocity of love about how we devour each other, and are devoured.It’s also about, I think, the stark strangeness of the world. Max returns home to find his dinner “was still hot”. According to Sendak, his editors wanted him to cut or change that line, because it was impossible – or at least to edit it, to a more believable, “and it was still warm”. In an interview, he said: “‘Warm’ doesn’t burn your tongue. There is something dangerous in ‘hot’ … Hot is the trouble you can get into. But I won.” The world is, after all, rampantly strange. Children deserve books that are so too.One Dog and His Boy by Eva IbbotsonIn a world that prizes a pose of exhausted knowingness, children’s fiction allows itself the unsophisticated stance of awe. Eva Ibbotson escaped Vienna in 1934, after Hitler declared her mother’s writing illegal her work is full of an unabashed astonishment at the sheer fact of existence. In One Dog and His Boy, Hal, a child with everything he could wish for except love and care, releases five dogs from the cruel Easy Pets agency. He and his friend Pippa and the small sea of dogs go on the run to his grandparents’ home.On the way, each dog finds the place in which they can be themselves the Pekingese Li-Chee, who once guarded the temples of monks, lying at the feet of a girl in a foster home Francine the poodle, a natural comedian, performing in a travelling circus. It’s a story about finding your place and your people about not pausing or doubting until you find them.It’s also, like many of Ibbotson’s books, a shot across the bow at an increasingly consumerist world Hal’s parents shower goods on him, “a gift pack from Hamley’s and another from Harrods … but in the whole of the house there was nothing that was alive”. It’s a sharp attack on the tide of acquisition that threatens to swamp us to keep your neck above it, the book tells us, you must find something alive to love, be it beast or man, and hold on with both hands. Keep close, because the world will be cold, and frenetic and plastic, and only with each other will we make it.I love Peter Pan for being so entirely itself, not a diluted version of some other, adult thing. It offers up to us its own defiant logic, for Neverland is the place of the free experiment of the imagination. “Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.” And I love Peter himself: Peter is joy but he’s also a threat: he’s the id and the ego, the danger of being kidnapped by desire, he’s dark and capricious. He’s Pan.Barrie would argue that adults cannot go to Neverland. He writes: “On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.” We adults, Barrie tells us, cannot return to that same reckless and freewheeling imagining. I disagree: I think the books summon up inside us the riotous, Panian parts of ourselves. I think, with Barrie’s aid, and with those who have come before and after him, we can sail back to those shores.There might be another lesson, too. Captain Hook, first name James, is an Old Etonian. Barrie writes: “He had been at a famous public school and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned … he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch.” Hook, in his dying moments, thinks of his childhood: of “the playing fields of long ago … or watching the wall-game from a famous wall”. In Barrie’s play version of the story, it is even more explicit: Hook’s last words are “Floreat Etona”, or “May Eton flourish”, the school’s motto.James Hook has been told he deserves everything, and when he does not get it, he attempts to bring destruction to Neverland, in the hope that from its chaos he shall rise. He has elaborate hair, “dressed in long curls”, and “he was never more sinister than when he was at his most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding”. Beware, the book tells us, pantomimic Old Etonians with unruly hair, who prize good form above truth, and who would seek to rule.• Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise is published by Bloomsbury.

In English, the book says that “we are constantly told that we are living in a new and frightening era of ‘post-truth’”, citing the annexation of the peninsula as an example.But in the Russian edition, Harari uses Trump to make this point: “According to estimates of the Washington Post newspaper, President Trump made more than 6,000 false public statements in the time after his inauguration.”Harari said that he had approved revisions of all his books for different audiences.“As a thinker and author, I do my best to reach erse audiences around the world. To enable my ideas and messages to easily reach people from various countries, over the years I have authorised and even initiated adaptations of all my books … The adaptations take into account different cultural, religious and political backgrounds. If I could, I would rewrite my books from scratch for each and every country, but I obviously cannot. When making adaptations, my guiding principle is to adapt the examples I use to explain my ideas, but never to change the ideas themselves,” he said.“In Russia, I was warned that due mainly to two examples I use, which sharply criticise the Russian invasion of Ukraine, censorship will not allow the publication and distribution of the book. I therefore faced a dilemma. Should I replace these few examples and publish the book in Russia – or should I change nothing, and publish nothing?”He said he chose to publish without the mention of the invasion, “because it seemed to me important that the book’s ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime. The Russian translation warns readers about the dangers of dictatorship, corruption, homophobia and nationalist extremism. I don’t support Russian censorship – I have to deal with it.”But Harari added that while he had authorised some changes to the Russian translation, he had since learned of further, unauthorised revisions: “I was told that where I speak of the Russian conquest of Crimea, ‘conquest’ was changed to ‘re-attachment’, and that where I speak about my husband, it was changed to ‘partner’. If this is true, I strongly object to all such unauthorised alterations, and I will do my best to correct them.”Two years ago, the fantasy novelist VE Schwab found that one of her scenes, about the romantic relationship between two male characters, had been cut in Russia without her permission. Books featuring LGBT characters and storylines are regularly shrinkwrapped in Russia, following 2013’s ruling banning the spreading of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e379e688dcbe58007ed142db33f33c6f788bd66f/0_10_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a869b406d6b802cf91ee9f0fdb0a9d3","title":"southern water may introduce hosepipe ban in hampshire","story":"Low river levels may lead to temporary measures in parts of county and Isle of WightHomes in the south of England could face the country’s first hosepipe ban since 2012 due to falling river water levels in Hampshire.Southern Water, which supplies 2.3 million customers, applied to the Environment Agency for a drought permit amid soaring temperatures across the UK this week.It said water levels in local rivers were low and likely to fall further after a dry winter and an even drier spring.If the permit is granted, a temporary use ban may be introduced for parts of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, one year after north-west England narrowly avoided a hosepipe ban after the longest heatwave since 1976.Privately owned Southern Water has applied for the permit because it hopes to be given permission to drain more than usual from the River Test in Hampshire, even though water levels are dwindling.If its request is successful, Southern Water would be obliged to ban the use of hosepipes to water lawns, or pressure washers to clean cars or patios, to avoid extra stress on the river’s ecosystem. The Environment Agency said it will decide whether to grant the permit by the end of August.Southern Water said if the permit was granted the bans would be carried out “in a phased way, in specific areas which depend on the River Test for water”. It added that it would provide full details in advance. A spokesman for the supplier declined to comment on how many homes would be affected.Karen Gibbs, from the Consumer Council for Water, said: “It’s important to stress that people in the affected area would only be asked not to use hosepipes and sprinklers, which can use huge amounts of water.“In the meantime we’d encourage customers to keep using water wisely and for Southern to do everything in its power to reduce the amount of water lost through leaking pipes – it should be leading by example.”The supplier is already importing water from neighbouring areas and deploying extra teams and technology to fix leaks in its pipe network due to low levels. Southern Water said: “We know it would be inconvenient and disruptive having to impose such measures but protecting the environment is a task for all of us.”The water shortage is the latest blow to the company, which is facing prosecution over “shocking” failures at  its sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. The legal challenge, led by the Environment Agency, comes after the industry regulator imposed a record £126m penalty against the supplier.Ofwat told Southern Water on Friday that it must communicate clearly with its customers about what is required if a hosepipe ban was introduced.The spokesman said: “We all have a part to play to protect and preserve water and this means that companies must also step up to this challenge. This means doing all that they can to reduce leakage and work hard to achieve this including with more innovation and collaboration.”Water companies are under pressure to improve their networks of pipe network and reservoirs to lessen the impact of growing populations and the climate crisis on supplies.In its latest industry report, Water UK found that 15 out of 18 water companies met the industry’s targets for reducing leakage this year but said more needed to be done.Water UK’s chief executive, Michael Roberts, said: “The overall picture on leakage has improved compared with last year. We are still determined to do better as an industry, and it remains one of our highest priorities.”Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company, was forced to pay £120m in customer compensation for its poor leakage record last year. It also failed to meet Water UK’s targets.A Thames Water spokesman said: “Tackling leakage is a top priority for us, and we’re spending more than £1m every day fixing an average of 1,400 leaks each week. Last month, leakage in our region hit its lowest level in three years.”Affinity Water and Hafren Water also fell short of the targets, according to Water UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35eb6f3113ee2b5143e7cacf1eea7e77566f666/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff34dd32180508f34710735662deea0","title":"the dramatic transformation of britains canals photographs then and now","story":"See how Britain’s waterways have changed from industrial corridors to spaces for living and leisureby  Claire Burke and  Jo BlasonIn their industrial heyday, canals were bustling scenes of trade and commerce in Britain’s cities. Horse-drawn commercial boats carried goods along the waterways, and at one point the canal network carried nearly 40m tonnes of freight a year.Today, canals are being reclaimed as recreational spaces in densely populated cities – destinations for city dwellers to run, cycle and socialise.

One layer down and the city has become an entirely different place.I, like many, am using the canal as a quiet cut-through. It smells different down here there’s the dankness of the water, for sure, but there’s a wealth of green filtering the fumes from above. And the soundscape changes – song birds, the curious grunt of a bank of geese eyeing me and the dog warily, the lap of the water’s edge and the groan of metal sidings that are there to repair the bridge.Today the canal is a shortcut to another part of the city, but the canals also represent an escape for me. There’s a freedom to this space that feels unpoliced by normal city rules. When I am kayaking they become an adventure playground, a way to get to part of the city you can’t reach on foot. A place to meet fellows, human or otherwise, that you might not find elsewhere.The life down here is distinctly feral. There are men fishing, some for fish, some for metal. I’ve seen a man using a huge magnet on a thick line of rope to trawl the canal floor for treasure. There’s a trail of unwanted, rusting finds a child’s bike, a ner, bolt cutter, a pulley, rod bars and what looks like a rotting safe, a screwdriver, endless bike locks and a horse shoe. The archaeology of the canal in rusted orange.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.The horse shoe will no doubt date to the 18th century, when barges were towed by horses, ponies, donkeys and mules. The pulley from a warehouse loading bay and the bike locks symbolise something eternal about canals, they can hide a multitude of sins and secrets.The wildlife is feral, too, for however pretty and picturesque the towpath edge appears, fecund in dog roses and elder, thick with blackberries, buddleias and alders and waterlilies, it is also uncultivated, these wild things taking back the margins.Some are distinctly prosaic, dandelions and verges of selfheal, and others utterly unexpected – a bank of redcurrants dangling over the water, a thicket of figs full of fruit and an untamed apple orchard from thrown-away cores.This wild nature that sprouts from the cracks in the towpath and between the bricks in the bridges is in spite of us. For these are some of the most heavily polluted areas we’ve created in cities. At the height of their construction in the 18th century, canals ran like trunk roads, zigzagging across the country, following natural contours but serving the greatest catchment area for trade purposes. You can roughly date a canal to pre- or post-1750s by whether it is narrow and meandering or ramrod straight and wide.The more experienced and sophisticated engineers, such as Thomas Telford and William Jessop, constructed less scenic but more efficient canals that cut a straight line through, rather than around, obstacles using aqueducts, tunnels, high embankment and deep cuttings. They were shorn out of the industrial revolution’s landscape, giving them their nickname the Cut, as they were blasted through Triassic rock faces.Where today we might see banks of trees towering over the water, there would have been wall-to-wall buildings, the air thick with coal smoke and the water full of factory run-off. The bottom layer of silt in the canal is still full of heavy metal pollution from the period.For this reason, the water is both beguiling and disturbing. In the right light it is as pretty as can be, dazzling the red brick buildings around it, bouncing light into hidden corners, beckoning you forth. But stare too deeply into its depth and you glimpse its murky otherworld. For a long time in Birmingham, the canals were known as Dead Dog Ditch. They have unforgiving sides with deep ledges that are not meant for climbing out of, and there are countless tales of souls lost to the water.In modern history the canals have been claimed by runners and canoeists, by cyclists and strollers as valuable green spaces in cities. But we are merely gentrifiers of our own forgotten space: the hard work has been done by many things down in the dark recesses of the bottom of the canal. Duck mussels filtering through the heavily polluted industrial sludge, cleaning the water as they sup, waterlilies pumping oxygen down to the root layer so that small water creatures can creep, and carp, bream, rudd and roach can dart away from predators such as pike and eel. And with these come kingfishers, water voles and shrews, cormorants and the long, heavy swoop of grey herons.Nature has reclaimed her ground in our most polluted industrial areas, a testament to her powers over our neglect.For me the joy of visiting the canals is that they are not static spaces, they are vibrant in summer, reflective in autumn and frankly too cold for paddling in winter, but they are like old friends. I hope their feral nature is never taken for granted.The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles, teenagers dipping their feet in bright-green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet, parks turned to hay, parents wiping screaming and heat-exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools, and car parks littered with ice-cube bags and fizzy drink cans. I have smelled other people’s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins. I have left imprints on other people’s furniture.In the words of my mother – who lived through the 1976 heatwave with my newborn sister – “It’s pretty hard to deny climate change in this.” But, my friends, if this week has taught us anything at all – other than that strange, slippery, silvery feel of under-breast condensation – it is that Britain is not ready to live at 38C we are ill-prepared for our changing climate.According to a new piece of modelling by the global ecology research centre Crowther Labs, by 2050 London will have the climate of Barcelona. Sure, allow people to burn fossil fuels, farm intensively, drive and fly unnecessarily and waste natural resources like water and gas at the rate we are now and we’ll eventually have the climate of Barcelona. But we’ll have it with the culture of an NCP car park: crowded, threatening, poorly designed and smelling in every corner of someone else’s piss. When temperatures spike at 30C for a few surprising days a year, the UK could feel like a giant summer party. Benches are dragged on to pavements turned moist by recently melted chewing gum children play out into the golden glow of late evening, hitting balls against garage doors and screaming through the spray of a hose you’d go to a beer garden on the way home and drink something ludicrous because it was cold and you smelled of suntan lotion and felt you were on holiday you might text someone you shouldn’t you might soak your bed sheets as a result.But this week, as our children’s bedrooms still thrum away at 34C by midnight and our mosquito bites turn ankles into hot, stiff tree trunks of infection, people were not smiling. Tragedies occurred as people flocked to unsound bits of dockland, river and coast, desperate to find relief from the screaming sun above us. Parents, employees and trains simply dragged to a halt, like carthorses through liquid concrete. Emotions frayed, gardens withered, pets gently desiccated and children were sprinted from tree to tree by anxious parents trying to find entertainment in the shade for eight hours at a time. Suddenly, selling off all those shady public parks, local swimming pools, cool and quiet libraries, pieces of riverbank and tree-lined playgrounds didn’t seem like such a clever way for councils to claw back some money after years of vicious government cuts.Yesterday, during the hottest July day of my entire British life, I walked past a group of men in long-sleeved, full-length, high-vis worksuits, laying tarmac in the middle of a road junction. Machines pounded, the bitumen steamed, the sun raged down on their sweat-streaked faces. Each one looked, in his own way, like he was about to die. Rushing home, I half-filled my 20-month-old’s baby bath with cold water (to be later poured over our plants), in the middle of our front room, unable to go outside and unwilling to burn more precious resources and thereby increase the climate problem by buying a fan or – ye gads – an air conditioner. I thought of all those people in flats, like mine, with windows designed to open the width of a dildo. I thought of the nappies bulging in ripe bin bags like slow-roast casseroles. I thought of the cars occupied by single drivers, chugging poisonous blue fumes over fields and rivers because profit-crazed, micro-managing, outmoded bosses refused their request to work from home. I thought of all the ice-creams turning soft in corner shops.I have walked down enough fart-warm high streets, watched enough music festival fights and spent enough time on glaze-baked buses to know that Britain isn’t ready for 40C summers. Not in our homes, not in our workplaces, not even in our bodies. You may want to deny the climate emergency, you may want to hang on to the luxury and irresponsibility that denial allows. But my friends, you cannot deny the smell of a twice-cancelled commuter train service, with a blocked and swinging toilet, creeping past a fly-tipped ditch as a sweaty businessperson pulls a tuna mayonnaise sandwich from their heat-soft leather bag. This is the future that climate denial is heading us for. And I, for one, am not cool with that.• Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub?

Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays.

He talks about juggling success with family life – and why he’s starring in a film about electricityMatthew Macfadyen was idling on the stoop of his boutique Manhattan hotel last month when a man walked past and said warmly: “I loved you in Billions.” Macfadyen, at 44, is one of the handful of male British actors on US TV – among them Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West and the actor for whom Macfadyen was mistaken, Damian Lewis – whom to American eyes can appear indistinguishable. “Thank you!” he replied, cheerfully. (Macfadyen is extremely polite, and inclined to be grateful for any recognition at all.) “Then he came back two minutes later and said: ‘Succession! So sorry.’” He roars with laughter.Tom Wambsgans, the role Macfadyen plays in Succession, is robustly against type. In the 14 years since he played Darcy to Keira Knightley’s Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, Macfadyen’s career has leaned heavily towards period drama. He did Anna Karenina and Little Dorrit. When the pilot script for Succession reached him, he had just played Mr Wilcox in the BBC adaptation of Howards End. Tom, the ambitious, oleaginous husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-type heiress was as far from these foppish roles as Macfadyen could get, a gift even before the show took off. “I thought: ‘I don’t know if this is going to have a life and I don’t know where the characters are going to go. But it’s clever and farcically funny.’” At the very least, he thought, “it’ll show I can do an American accent”.In the event, Succession was one of the breakout hits of last year a smart, funny, compulsively watchable drama about Logan Roy, an ailing media plutocrat, played by Brian Cox, and his furiously competing adult children. It was created by Jesse Armstrong, of Peep Show and The Thick of It, and combined the feel of a stately, prestige HBO show with the savage compound-swearing that is recognisable to anyone who loves Armstrong’s work. “It’s very caustic,” says Macfadyen, “which you recognise as a Brit.” In spite of the show’s American characters and setting, he is right when he says “there’s a British sensibility to it”.We are in a restaurant in midtown Manhattan during the last days of Macfadyen’s three-month stint filming the show’s second season. At the end of the week, he is due to fly to Croatia to film episode 10 and then home to London to his family: his wife, Keeley Hawes, and their two children, Maggie and Ralph. The last time I saw Macfadyen, he was in New York filming season one of Succession and Hawes was in the UK riding out the fuss around her BBC drama Bodyguard. Now, with Macfadyen’s success in the US – albeit more muted than British hysteria around Bodyguard – their positions are reversed.“It was peculiar,” he says, of the fuss surrounding his wife’s show. “Richard Madden couldn’t leave his house! There was a WhatsApp group in his street, with friends saying: ‘It’s bad today, stay in.’ It was really bonkers.”Succession is a vastly superior show and, along with the other actors, Macfadyen is excellent in it. As Tom, he plays a man of staggering venality and weakness who is nonetheless not wholly a monster. “While on one level, they are all revolting and the rest of it, they’re not amoral,” he says. “They’re doing their best with what they’ve got. And it’s a family, so instantly you’ve got a hook.” The occasionally ludicrous lengths to which characters go to achieve their aims are no more ludicrous, says Macfadyen, than real life. “Just look at what’s going on in the world now – people turning their backs in the European parliament. If they put that in a show, you wouldn’t believe it.”In spite of almost 20 years of solid visibility on UK screens, Macfadyen is unfailingly modest about his achievements. You do something good and then you wait, he says, and often nothing of value comes along. “I felt like I was treading water a little bit in the UK just before Howards End. I’d done a show called Ripper Street, in which I was a Victorian copper, which was lovely. But there were certain things I didn’t want to do after that I didn’t want to do an ITV drama, or thriller. That sounds snobbish, but you know what I mean. So you wait for a play or a movie.”One of the projects he said yes to was a movie with Benedict Cumberbatch called The Current War, the story of Thomas Edison’s race with George Westinghouse to “put a star in a jar” as Edison puts it in the movie, and be the first to provide the US with electricity. Macfadyen plays JP Morgan, who financed both men. It is a small, but satisfying, role in a gripping and beautifully shot movie that also tackles Edison’s grief at the loss of his wife. Watching the movie, you are struck by a sense of precedent: that, 100 years from now, similar projects will be made about the race to own the internet.Macfadyen has yet to see the result. “Does it work?” he says keenly. “Is it interesting? It’s quite a dry subject, if I’m honest.” He bursts out laughing. In fact, it does work and is oddly moving. The film is beautifully directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and co-stars Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, the eccentric third participant in the race, who memorably died broke and alone in a hotel room in New York. Macfadyen is suitably pompous as Morgan, and Cumberbatch plays the kind of twitchy, mercurial character he has come to specialise in – his performance as Edison is recognisably in the vein of Sherlock and Patrick Melrose.The story of the race to invent electricity was never going to break box office records, but, for Macfadyen, it came down to finding interest in that particular period of history and the chance to work with a terrific team.“I thought the script was good. I thought it would be fun – nice, prestigious, and with great people.” And JP Morgan was an interesting character. “He had this enormous bulbous nose, and wouldn’t let anyone photograph him. And he bailed out the economy, apparently. His house in London was kept staffed, and they made him a full breakfast every morning, in case he arrived unexpectedly. Then every morning, they cleared it away.”Last time we met, Macfadyen had talked about the disparity between his and his wife’s experiences of the movie industry, from the fact “there are just less parts for women, and there’s also a weird thing with women where you’re the ingenue, and then there’s a wasteland, and then you’re Hedda Gabler”, to the fact that “men are, by and large, paid more than women. I know this from Keeley – that the sort of excuse they’ll use is: ‘Well he’s done a few American things.’ And you think, well, no. It’s not to do with that. It’s cobblers.”He never had direct experience of Weinstein himself. But he and Hawes intuitively resisted moving to Los Angeles and immersing themselves more fully in Hollywood. “It didn’t seem like somewhere we wanted to live,” he says. The family came out to visit him in New York in half-term, but this time the novelty had worn off. “I’ve found it quite tough, this time, being away,” he says. “Partly because I haven’t gotten back as much as I did last time, but also I’ve done all the walks I don’t need to buy any more jeans. And if I have more than three of four days off and I can’t get back, I miss the kids.”The virtue of doing a series such as Succession is that there is a six-month break between seasons, during which time it’s conventional for actors to knock themselves out doing movie work or hustling for other high-profile projects. But after finishing season one of Succession, Macfadyen thought: sod it. “Keeley found herself busy in a bonkers way, and we had building work, and I just took the kids away. It was amazing. I took them to France for the whole summer. Maggie’s almost 15, and I was thinking: ‘She’s not going to put up with this for much longer,’ so we went and it was just heaven. Nothing was coming in for me and I thought: ‘Oh, fuck it, I’m just going to go.’”In some ways, that kind of concentrated time with kids may be better than snatched hours at the end of the day. “That’s what I say to myself when I spend weeks away and start to think: ‘Oh, God.’ But that summer was magic. And the rest of this year Keeley’s busy and I’ll be able to be there again. Being on their nerves.”Season two of the show feels even more timely than the first. These days, the dysfunctional Roy family puts you less in mind of the Murdochs than the Trumps. “There’s an absence of love, somewhere. And it all comes from daddy. They can’t really, truly, have any proper confidence in themselves even though they’re stuffed full of cash and can do anything.” Yes, if you’re raised by a narcissist, it’s no wonder you turn out like Ivanka. “Or those boys! Jesus Christ.”The news depresses him. “I don’t know where to put my frustration. I get into a ball of fury about it, and then I don’t know what to do with it. Someone said to me the other day, why aren’t people protesting in the streets about the children at the border? People sort of shrug and say: ‘What can you do?’ You feel powerless. There was a brilliant article by Jonathan Freedland about how Trump wants to be a dictator. And then you shrug and think: ‘Oh, it’ll be all right.’”He looks stricken. “Same with climate change. You know, ‘Someone will build a shield.’ Or, ‘Yeah, we’ll seed clouds in the sky.”Time to buy a house in Duluth, I suggest. He laughs. “Keeley was saying something like this the other day: what about finding a house in wherever? You need a well.”Macfadyen’s levity communicates the refreshing perspective that acting is really quite silly. Still, he says, when something is good it raises everyone up. “I really think that. I went to see Andrew Scott doing Hamlet a while ago, and I felt proud to be an actor. It was a great production. And it was a beautiful performance, not the terrible idiocy that it sometimes seems, but” – he looks surprised by his own conclusion – “thrilling.”• The Current War is out in the UK on Friday 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a922017d5ceabcee89a35c9d59eebb32c8c5558/0_145_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0046721a99ca789c55c78711d20fb3","title":"how to make chapatis at home cooking tips kitchen aide","story":"To produce these beautifully pliable Indian flatbreads, and not paving slabs, a few precise steps are required ...Why is it so hard to make chapatis at home? I follow recipes to the letter, and buy the proper flour from a local Indian store, yet they always turn out like MDF. Am I missing a trick?Lizzie, Leeds“The key to chapati is the consistency of the dough,” says West-Country-based chef and food writer Romy Gill. “And if you are using true chapati flour, it’s vital the water ratio is correct, because it’s incredibly fine flour that goes very sticky very easily.”Once you’ve kneaded the dough, pop it in a bowl in the fridge for half an hour before you even think about starting to shape and cook chapatis, says Gill, whose debut book, Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India, is out in September. “The cold makes it go harder, which makes it easier to roll if you leave it at room temperature, it just gets wetter and stickier.”In other words, as with all bread-making, this is not the time for guesswork, even if you have years of knowhow. Sanjay Gour, co-owner with Nand Kishor of the much-acclaimed Dastaan in Epsom, Surrey (the pair previously ran the kitchens at the even more vaunted Gymkhana in London), goes a step further to stave off dry bread: “Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl, apply a very thin layer of oil to the top and cover with clingfilm – that will stop it from drying out and forming a skin.” Like Gill, Gour gives his dough at least a 30-minute chill, but adds that it’s advisable to leave the dough out to relax a little afterwards, so it’s more pliable and easier to ide into balls.Gour says another possible cause of Lizzie’s dry chapatis may be that she’s dusting them with too much flour when shaping. “Obviously, you need some flour, because this dough sticks to just about anything, but if you use even a bit more than you need, it will dry out and you’ll end up with dehydrated bread that’s not at all nice to eat.” If you’re in any doubt as to how much is too much, give the chapatis a good shake or two when rolling, just to be on the safe side.Gill adds that if you can’t get hold of chapati flour locally, you can make a pretty decent fist of it using plain or wholemeal instead. “I did a recipe for the Observer a few years ago that’s pretty foolproof.” But, she adds, a different flour requires a different treatment: “Rather than refrigerating it, keep the dough at room temperature, because it does the opposite of chapati flour dough.”Gill and Gour agree on another non-negotiable: brush one side of each cooked chapati with melted butter, then fold the bread over and cover with a tea towel. As Gill says, “This keeps them moist and soft, otherwise they’ll be like cardboard before the whole batch is cooked.”In India, many households make chapatis on a tava, or tawa – basically, a very flat, thin frying pan, often made of cheap steel or aluminium, designed for cooking all kinds of flatbreads, from chapatis to parathas and dosas (you can pick one up online for as little as a fiver) – but Gill says “a basic pancake pan works just fine”. Gour, however, prefers a flat griddle because, without the extreme heat of a professional hob, he reckons it’s better for getting the requisite char and blistering. “If Lizzie’s ever in Surrey,” he says, “tell her to pop over to Dastaan and we’ll give her a quick lesson.” I’m no Derren Brown, but somehow I foresee a fair few “Lizzies from Leeds” dialling Gour’s restaurant round about … now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f11ae1328631871ef7c88096ef010f248d41a5f9/0_53_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f81011159f1c609f72f742c82ac2724","title":"who knew the international champions cup meant so much","story":"Sign up now!

She did not receive any guidance from the committee until earlier this month, by which time she had already earned £10,000.Patel has been approached for comment by the .The Essex MP was forced to resign from the cabinet in November 2017 as international development secretary when she was accused of breaching the ministerial code over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. Patel conceded in her resignation letter that her actions fell below standards of transparency and openness required.Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has written to the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, calling for an investigation into whether Patel has broken the ministerial code, and has called for her dismissal if this is found to be the case. Johnson himself has breached the code in the past when he resumed writing for the  after resigning as foreign secretary he failed to declare the role with Acoba.Trickett said: “Very few people will be surprised that Boris Johnson’s cabinet is embroiled in scandal less than 48 hours after being appointed, yet it is still deeply worrying.“It is an early sign that Johnson’s hard-right government will have little regard for the standards expected of ministers, by the ministerial code and by the public.“When she resigned in 2017, Patel spoke of her failure to uphold the necessary ‘standards of transparency and openness’. It appears she has done so again.“Clearly Patel does not think the rules apply to her, and the same could be said of many others in Johnson’s cabinet. Johnson must immediately sanction an investigation to confirm whether Patel has yet again broken the code, and reassure the public that his government will not tolerate those that disregard it so lightly.“I have written to the prime minister to ensure that this course of action is taken immediately.”Acoba approved the appointment but with strict conditions. The committee said given her seniority and profile as a secretary of state there was a risk that it could be perceived Patel’s contacts “might assist Viasat unfairly”.As a result, Acoba said Patel could take up the appointment but should not draw on any privileged information available from her time as international development secretary, should not lobby the UK government on behalf of Viasat and should not provide provide advice on any contracts with the UK government.Viasat provides products and services to the Ministry of Defence.

The equanimity with which he faces his shortcomings this season and the realisation his Ferrari team cannot challenge Mercedes for the Formula One title, says much for his character.Yet competing in the 11 remaining races in a car with which he is struggling weighs heavy and that smile must be beginning to fade. Little wonder that debate in the paddock before his home race at the German Grand Prix on Sunday revolves around whether he will retire at the end of the season.At 32, Vettel has four titles, all for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. He joined Ferrari in 2015 with the intent of emulating Michael Schumacher, building the team around him and returning their first drivers’ championship since 2007. What followed has been a rollercoaster of optimism and shattered hopes that could easily break a driver. Vettel insists he will see out his final season with Ferrari next year before deciding on his future.This season is already gone, with Vettel 100 points behind Lewis Hamilton, and Mercedes holding a distinct advantage. Once again the hope of a Ferrari challenge has disappeared, dispiritingly almost from the opening race. The Scuderia, who had backed Vettel as their No 1 driver from the off, appear to have given the German a car that simply does not suit him.In the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Ferrari were blown away by the dominant Mercedes. By 2017 they were in a position to mount a challenge and last year were even stronger, with the superior car for much of the season. Errors by driver and team proved costly and their hopes slipped away.Last year Vettel went off at Hockenheim while leading in the rain, the low point of a season peppered with mistakes. This year he spun while in competition with Hamilton in Bahrain, and in Canada went off when under pressure from the British driver. At the last race at Silverstone, his misjudgment in crashing into Max Verstappen was as public and as egregious an error as he has made since Spa 2010 when he lost control at the Bus Stop and hit Jenson Button.He has admitted he is more than aware of his failings. “I always put myself under pressure, so I can’t be happy if things go wrong,” he said. “The pressure I put on myself after that is bigger than any external factors. For me it’s the most honest and straightforward way to deal with it myself, because I know what I’ve done wrong and what I’ve done right.”The incident at the British Grand Prix was seen as an error indicative of a driver struggling for confidence. Alain Prost singled it out. “The collision at Silverstone happened due to a lack of judgment. We clearly see that he is not in top form,” he said. “It is due to a lack of sufficient concentration, motivation or judgment.”At Hockenheim Vettel has insisted it is a privilege not a burden to race for Ferrari. However Johnny Herbert, who raced alongside Michael Schumacher at Benetton in 1995, is convinced that representing the Scuderia lies heavy on Vettel. “Sebastian still has to carry Ferrari on this shoulders,” he said. “The pressure of Italy, of the team, of the media. In the last couple of years they haven’t taken that pressure off. That massive weight hasn’t allowed him to breathe. Ferrari haven’t got that balance right, a driver needs that.”But what seems equally as important as where Vettel is mentally is what he is feeling through the seat of his pants. His titles were won during the blown diffuser period of 2010-2011 and then when it was banned, Red Bull maintained their advantage by clever channelling of exhaust gasses in 2012-2013. The period was one where downforce was dominant and Vettel was its master.He likes to arrive fast into the corner, brake late and turn-in aggressively, before getting back on the power. The Red Bull suited this to perfection, he had the front end he needed for corner entry and the confidence that the grip would be there when he hit the throttle on exit.When the Red Bull struggled with rear stability early in one season, Vettel’s teammate Mark Webber had an edge. As the team solved the problem, the car came to Vettel, as did the title. In 2014 when all exhaust blowing was removed Vettel looked uncomfortable, did not win a race and was beaten by his inexperienced teammate Daniel Ricciardo.This season Ferrari will have endeavoured to build a car to suit Vettel, instead they have delivered what appears to be the opposite, a car with inherent understeer. Worse still he has struggled to adapt to it. Since the Canadian GP he has been outqualified and outperformed by his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in every race. Leclerc seems more adept at being able to hustle the car through the corners.“If I don’t feel what I need it’s a bit tricky,” Vettel said of his car in 2018 at Melbourne. It is a view with which Herbert concurs. “The car is not what he wants,” he said. “It’s not delivering what he needs to feel through the tips of his fingers and his shoulders and when you don’t have that feeling you are going to struggle and then the mental side comes in.”The Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto, has held up his hands in admitting the car is not where it should be but publicly Vettel remains committed to his task. This year he married his childhood sweetheart with whom he has two children and while he enjoys a life away from F1 at Hockenheim he reiterated his intent to see out his time with Ferrari. Having put four years in already and still smiling, Vettel knows there is still a job to be done with the team.“He went to Ferrari to try to win a championship, he has not achieved that,” Herbert said. “I would be so surprised if he walked away having not achieved that. I would be shocked if he did that. The opportunity is still there. He has not finished the job he went there to do.”At their home race Mercedes are running a white livery to celebrate 125 years since what is considered the first race held in 1894 from Paris to Rouen. Ferrari however had the edge in Friday’s first practice session. Vettel was quickest with Leclerc second in front of Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. The Ferrari teammates traded places in the afternoon session with Leclerc holding a 0.124sec advantage. Hamilton again had to settle for third, 0.146sec off Leclerc’s pace. Mercedes, struggling in the fierce temperatures as they had in Austria, will be hoping for cooler weather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464a5ed729f2642993819e7e09994dfc35e99567/0_749_5425_3255/master/5425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae8eede79a0bf88802e95dcd6cb193c","title":"tour de france fans in pictures","story":"As the Tour de France nears a thrilling close, we look at the cycling fans who have lined the roadside from Brussels to the Alps"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f42735685a13f5951f5b64a46f8d1f0c126384f/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83fcf45d3f6a83213264e89aab6caa5b","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 19 live","story":"Egan Bernal was leading the stage when hail and snow on the final descent caused a sudden abandonment – and the Colombian is provisionally 45 seconds ahead of Julian AlaphilippeWe’re still waiting for official confirmation of the new standings, but Egan Bernal has been awarded the yellow jersey. Time to wrap things up here, but stay tuned for Jeremy Whittle’s race report, and more reaction on our website. We’ll see you tomorrow, right? Here are those provisional standings again:Ineos team principal Sir Dave Brailsford said he had mixed feelings about taking the yellow jersey in such circumstances but it had always been his team’s plan to be aggressive on the day. “Fortune favours the brave at the end of the day,” said Brailsford. “We were always going to take today on and I thought the guys rode really well, to be honest. “Thomas and Bernal had a plan – G went first and then Egan went over the top. “We were hoping to get to the descent in that situation, and then who knows what would have happened. “We don’t control the weather. In one way, I’m really happy but in another way, I’m still really concerned for everyone else out there.” Asked if the weather had helped his team win the Tour, as now seems likely, Brailsford replied: “It didn’t. No, we’ll win the Tour de France because of how we ride.”We’re still waiting on those official general classification standings. Once we have them, you’ll have them. The jerseys have now been handed out at a ceremony in Tignes …Re 17:05, this in from Jack Lee …What, like this you mean?”Another question in the inbox:Does anyone understand the rationale behind no stage winner and no combativity prize but everything else being awarded? Or is it just me that finds this confusing?My assumption is that this is to factor in the possibility that riders were holding back their biggest effort for the finish. Kind of like the DLS method in cricket, where it takes in the idea that sides are likely to pick up the pace and aggression towards the end of their innings.I’m not sure the organisers will go for it at 48 hours’ notice, but here’s Fraser Innes’s stage 21 suggestion …Set the riders off with the gaps they have between them in such a way that the first man over the line will win the GC.As reported by AP:I gave it all, I don’t have any regret,” he said. “I’ve been beaten by stronger than me.”Marc Madiot, the manager of Groupama-FDJ, said:Safety is the first priority and the decision to stop the stage seemed to be the only decision to make,” he said. “Imagine that the race had continued and a rider had plunged into a ravine.”Ian Davis has a point of order … Would all those suggesting that the last stage is raced properly like to explain how a short, flat stage is going to affect the GC classifications.If one of the riders pedalled DEAD, DEAD FAST? From the Tour de France site: “The time bonuses at Col d’Iseran are taken into account. Here are the provisional overall standings”1 Egan Bernal2 Julian Alaphilippe +45sec3 Geraint Thomas +1min 034 Steven Kruijswijk +1:155 Emanuel Buchmann +1:42I’m still getting emails with names of 30-year-old films. It was still Ghostbusters II. I’m sorry. It just was.Such an exciting weekend ahead now, on the back of all this, as Andrew (and many others) suggest …The organisers show their working re: the decision …Wiggins on Eurosport: “I can’t see Bernal losing the race from here.”Unofficial timings give Bernal a lead of 45 seconds going into Saturday’s final mountain stage, as he seeks to become the first Colombian to win the Tour. “We wanted to smash it today and the guys were super-motivated. It would have been ideal if the race could have continued because even if he had reduced the gap in the descent, Julian would have suffered in the last ascent.” There will be no bonus handed out for the stage win, and no Most Aggressive Rider award. Still no word on whether the mountain climb time bonuses will be applied.This in from Jonathan Peña on the email…Regardless on whether it was good for him or not, it’s good for us. Now we have a TDF final of sorts to look forward to. Does not get much better than that.Here’s an idea – race Paris! I think that the best way to handle this situation is to make the stage into Paris an actual race. Of course it breaks tradition, but also it’s an extra 128km that might help sort out this messy stage.Quick PA report of where things are …The official Tour rolling report is now saying: “Distinctive jerseys will be presented on stage – yellow and white to Egan Bernal, polka dot jersey to Romain Bardet and green jersey to Peter Sagan.”Interesting conflicts of opinion in my inbox regarding whether the early finish is good or bad for Alaphilippe.Surely this could work out ok for Alaphilippe? While he might (and it’s a big ask) have caught the Thomas group on the descent, given his struggles going up the climb before that then he’d surely have been lost on the final climb and dropped out of the podium places altogether?Alaphilippe was going to lose 5-10 minutes up the final climb. None of this “unlucky” narrative, he was toast if the stage had gone full distance. Completely ridiculous. Alaphilippe was robbed. They need to re-race the section they didn’t race today on Sunday. Move Sunday’s ceremonial ride into Paris to Monday. No one who seriously cares about this race cares about the final stage anyway. Apparently there was no official time checkpoint at the top of Iseran, where the stage results will be taken from. With every second crucial, they are rightly taking their time over publishing official standings.They’re obviously biased, but have a point …Bradley Wiggins, speaking on Eurosport, is suggesting they could have continued through, or resumed following the affected area.There is a case to be made for neutralising the race, and then continuing afterwards. The perilous descent, and the speeds involved, surely played a part in the decision. The organisers needed to get them to stop riding as soon as possible. It’s such a hard one, and the fallout will be fascinating. It’s a decision that could cost Alaphilippe the Tour – you have to feel for him. I say again, he was almost freefalling down the mountain. Imagine if he’d fallen round one of the hairpins, and then later found the downhill wasn’t even technically part of the race.License to Kill – no Jonathan Pena and Jan “40 guesses” Karremans.Sea of Love – no, Adolfo Prieto.The War of the Roses – sorry, Brian Goecke.“I really hope it’s Blind Fury what with Rutger Hauer’s passing” – awwww, apologies Matthew Atkinson. I kind of wish it had been now.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Soz Matt Fulford.“Ghostbusters”, asks Tom Cox.“Ghostbusters 2”, offer Dave Rotheram and Carlos Benitez.HALLELUJAH! Congrats Dave and Carlos, and apologies for anything else you can see in my brain.There had been a landslide as a result of the weather, too. The more we see the road conditions, the worse it all looks. Make absolutely no mistake whatsoever – the organisers have made the correct decision here. It’s horrible, desperate luck for Alaphilippe, but the riders were rightly kept well away from all this.They’re still untangling this, and meanwhile Eurosport are showing images of a snowplough shovelling thick slush from the road. It’s definitely for the best that nobody was travelling at speed while that was coming down, or this could have been a much grimmer read.38km to go, **Simon**, not Sean Yates. Apologies. There was a race going on and several dozen people pummelling me with the names of 80s films.“Weekend at Bernal’s” – kudos to Craig Secor for the wordplay. Still no.Ridiculous swing of weather over the two days, incidentally. It was 40C at points of yesterday’s stage.Meanwhile:ParenthoodRoad HouseBorn on the Fourth of JulyWeekend at Bernie’s (“Not very ” – Thomas Atkins)The Abyss“The Delinquents starring the one and only Kylie”Tango and CashTurner and HoochDrugstore CowboyDead CalmSee No Evil, Hear No EvilCrimes and MisdemeanorsElectric Blue 29 (“a more underground, art house-style film” – Jon CowderoyMy Left Foot (“in honour of Pinot’s problems” – Daniel Hellerman) All incorrect. I’m starting to worry I’ve got my years wrong.Oooh – Uncle Buck. Didn’t think of that. Sorry Eric S – nope.The riders are easing on down what was set to be a manic plunge. Hard not to feel a bit robbed of what could have been a stunning spectacle. It’s a huge blow for Alaphilippe. Unclear at this stage if the time bonuses from the Col d’Iseran will stand – we’ll let you know. It’s such a good result for Bernal, however they work it out.From the TV pictures, it looks completely understandable. It’s apparently several inches of hail on the road. Christian Prudhomme is currently taking pelters from riders as he passes them to relay the news.Egan Bernal is going to take yellow. This will take some untangling – stay with us.And no it’s not Steel Magnolias, dammit.Further ahead it looks like thick snow on the road, but it’s actually hail. Alaphilippe is distraught at hearing the news – they’ll be taking the results from the top of the Col d’Iseran.He was flying down the descent, and all for naught. Ridiculous drama.30km to go: points and time bonuses from the big climb1 Egan Bernal, 40pts, 8sec time bonus2 Simon Yates, 30, 5sec bonus3 Warren Barguil, 24, 2sec bonusWillem Van Gemert says Black Rain. Appropriate, but no.Jan Karremans has had way too many guesses, but all wrong so far. My Left Foot and Look Who’s Talking are valiant attempts, mind.Several guesses for The Punisher. Haven’t seen it. Any good?36km to go: Alaphilippe was 34sec behind Bernal on the virtual standings as the Colombian went over the top, over two mins behind on the stage. But now Alaphilippe is descending. This could be a sight to see. 38km to go: Time bonus for Bernal for reaching the summit first.He leads the stage, with Sean Yates behind. Thomas is now part of a chase group of four, along with Kruijswijk, Buchmann and Le Plus.It’s not The Little Mermaid or Back To The Future II. Or Field of Dreams, or Honey I Shrunk The Kids.Stop guessing When Harry Met Sally and Dead Poets Society. It’s not those.38.5km to go: Alaphilippe is now in deficit. Seven seconds behind. This is a superb effort from Bernal.39km to go – 1.6km left to the Roof of the Tour: Bernal is NINE seconds behind Alaphilippe on the virtual GC. Thomas now just 32sec. Remember, it is raining later in the course, and there’s a big descent coming up.39.5km to go: I’ve just received 16 emails, all naming films from 1989. Bear with me – both Bernal and Thomas are now well within a minute of Alaphilippe on the virtual GC. 42km to go: Absolute bedlam on the climb. I’m still not clear who the Ineos team leader is – Bernal initially stayed on Alaphilippe’s shoulder while Thomas rode away, before realising he could move away from him with ease. Steven Kruijswijk is in touch, and the yellow jersey holder is leaking time. But is it enough? We’ve seen slow-mo images of Alaphilippe grimacing already this week, and then look what happened.43.4km to go: Thomas make a move. It’s a big effort from the Welshman. Alaphilippe is struggling to keep pace. Landa’s leaving him behind too. There’s still 5.5km of Iseran for him to contend with. It’s a huge moment for the defending champion.Jack Lee – it’s not Bill \u0026amp Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Robert Hillier – not Do The Right Thing either.Yellow card to Emmanuel Grieve for naming three: Turner and Hooch, Pet Semetary, The Burbs. All thankfully wrong.44km to go: And then there were two. Dylan van Baarle was the third prong of the Ineos trio, and his work at the front of the peloton is done.The ision of labour is now 13 up front, a straggler in Michael Woods, and now just 13 in the group around Alaphilippe.46km to go: Ineos are pushing at the front of the peloton. Thomas and Bernal are there as part of an Ineos trident. AG2R La Mondiale’s Matthias Frank initially tried to break clear, but to no avail – his stablemate Bardet is still knocking around, however.TV pictures of Alaphilippe showed him rocking slightly in the saddle before calming. We’re still waiting for a decisive move.49km: Up, up and away … time to climb. And here’s me thinking the little bump over the A road on Route 51 was a bit troublesome.Meanwhile, Joseph Trivers is offering varying numbers of thumbs up for more films from 1989 …Batman – always had a soft spot for it due to Prince’s soundtrack, and Danny Elfman’s score. I suspect I’m not alone.Indiana Jones and the Last CrusadeThe Cook, The Thief, His Wife, Her Lover – another fine film score too, this time from Michael NymanI’m going to keep posting these until someone names the 1989 film I currently have in my head.50km to go: full intermediate sprint result …Peter Sagan is safely in the yellow jersey group, presumably swapping Panini stickers and telling NSFW jokes.54km to go: Col d’Iseran coming up. Lots of refuelling, team pep talks, a little bit of sitting back in the saddle going on. Brave faces all round, but some telling deep breaths being taken too. Rain is on the horizon too. Eeeeek. Never mind the climb, the descent could make or break the whole thing for the main players. 58km to go: intermediate sprint fun. An unexpectedly lively fight for the line. Alexey Lutsenko won it by a short helmet ahead of Gallopin, Barguil, Nibali and Amador.More points were handed out a little earlier while I was trying to remember what films came out in 1989 …61km to go: Big names still safely in the peloton.Bardet, who looked to be suffering earlier as he fell off the back, is safely among the yellow jersey group. Seven of the top eight in the GC standings (Pinot the absentee) are still riding with Alaphilippe around them – that means Bernal, Thomas, Kruijswijk, Buchmann, Quintana and Landa Meana. Uran and Valverde, who began today in ninth and 10th, are still in the lead group.Adam Yates has just fallen from the back of the peloton.63km to go: Just the one chase group now as the five merge.Ineos’ Jonathan Castroviejo is currently at the head of the peloton, which is now 1:47 off the front. At this stage that gap is much less significant than the climbs that lie ahead.64km to go: The field fragments. There are now three groups ahead of the peloton. The leaders now number 21, with stragglers forming two chase groups behind. Aru, Kreuziger, Bettiol, De Gendt and Gesbert are those currently riding ‘tween front and yellow.66km to go: Official word on Pinot from Groupama-FDJ. The strapping was on a muscular injury that it was hoped would improve overnight. It evidently hasn’t. And thus: sad toodles to Thibaut.67km to go: Mollema is blowing. Fighting to the lead group has taken its toll and he’s currently riding an entirely different race to those around him.What do you think the chances of a BergalThomas duo attack, too risky? If they run ahead, leave it to the two of them for a sprint finish for who leads the team … As you can tell, I’m a bit of a dreamer. It would be the outcome Ineos fans want, whilst maintaining the newly unpredictable nature of this tour?I think the final climb is going to be mesmerising with this in mind. My suspicions for most of the race have been split evenly between suspecting Thomas isn’t in the form he needs, and waiting for him to explode for a huge effort on one of the mountain stages. There’s little clue of a team hierarchy on the stage yet, which is interesting.69km to go: More final day thoughts …71km to go: keep an eye on Uran and Valverde. EF Education First’s Uran isn’t the Colombian most thought would be prominent today, but these are the only two of the top 10 GC riders in the main group. The peloton had dropped to 75sec behind, but with the leaders riding into a headwind, it’s now down to 54sec. Expect that to grow again for a spell as the peloton find the wind brushing their ears. Cort’s lead evaporated almost as quickly as it opened up.73km to go: A couple more names to report in the lead group – Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) and Michael Matthews (Sunweb). Which I only realised as Matthews dropped off the back. He’s wincing, suddenly.Cort is having a go at the front. He’s opened up a 14sec gap.78km to go: The peloton edges back. Now back to a lovely round minute back from the lead group.On the final stage protocol front, lots of correspondence regarding the 1989 Tour, which ended with an inidual time-trial into Paris, out of which Greg LeMond emerged victorious. As with most things from the late-80s, feels like a different world now. An age thing, of course, but is the gap from 1989 to today really the same as that from 1959 to then? The Gap from Ben Hur to Lethal Weapon 2 … the same as from When Harry Met Sally and Hobbs and Shaw. Sorry, there’s a race happening …80km to go: The lead group now features 26 riders.Here’s who’s up front, now 62sec ahead of yellow jersey group … Dylan van Baarle (Ineos)Patrick Konrad (Bora-Hansgrohe)Tony Gallopin (AG2R-La Mondiale)Vincenzo Nibali and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Merida)Sébastien Reichenbach (Groupama-FDJ)Alejandro Valverde, Marc Soler and Andrey Amador (Movistar)Pello Bilbao, Gorka Izagirre, Magnus Cort and Alexey Lutsenko (Astana)Laurens De Plus (Jumbo-Visma)Rigoberto Uran, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Woods (EF Education First)Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott)Dan Martin and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates)Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo)Jesus Herrada (Cofidis)Guillaume Martin (Wanty-Groupe Gobert)Roman Kreuziger (Dimension Data)Warren Barguil and Elie Gesbert (Arkéa-Samsic)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df0fddfdc5653660f61acc74207a117818b5fa5/0_306_4230_2538/master/4230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da152c217fd3646f9b8dc7ae244d43bd","title":"barber shop chronicles review roundhouse inua ellams","story":"Roundhouse theatre, LondonInua Ellams’ play hurtles between London and Africa, so full is it of authentic male dialogue and connectionsEven the clock moves at double time.

Sometimes the script is almost too rich – there’s so much information to take in – but it’s an undeniably beautiful thing, packed with authentic dialogue and stunning flashes of insight.There’s passionate political and personal debate as the men discuss Mugabe, Mandela, fallen leaders and absent fathers. Perhaps the most surprising aspect is just how tender this all-male play feels. Sure, there’s posturing and showboating, especially when Demmy Ladipo’s “bad boy” is showing off to the lads.

There are the music and movement, overseen by Elander Moore, which infuse the scene-changes with energy and purpose. There are also the collective sighs, groans and cheers, as the men talk, listen and, of course, watch football.

Those mistakes can be understandable – a BBC interview about Syria was interrupted by the assistant last year – or less so. “The sound of a zip, Siri often hears as a trigger,” the contractor said. The service can also be activated in other ways. For instance, if an Apple Watch detects it has been raised and then hears speech, Siri is automatically activated.The whistleblower said: “There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data.”That accompanying information may be used to verify whether a request was successfully dealt with. In its privacy documents, Apple says the Siri data “is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services”. There is no specific name or identifier attached to a record and no inidual recording can be easily linked to other recordings.Accidental activations led to the receipt of the most sensitive data that was sent to Apple. Although Siri is included on most Apple devices, the contractor highlighted the Apple Watch and the company’s HomePod smart speaker as the most frequent sources of mistaken recordings. “The regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high,” they said. “The watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds – not that long but you can gather a good idea of what’s going on.”Sometimes, “you can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you’d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise – you can’t say definitely, but it’s a drug deal … you can definitely hear it happening. And you’d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.”The contractor said staff were encouraged to report accidental activations “but only as a technical problem”, with no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings. “We’re encouraged to hit targets, and get through work as fast as possible. The only function for reporting what you’re listening to seems to be for technical problems. There’s nothing about reporting the content.”As well as the discomfort they felt listening to such private information, the contractor said they were motivated to go public about their job because of their fears that such information could be misused. “There’s not much vetting of who works there, and the amount of data that we’re free to look through seems quite broad. It wouldn’t be difficult to identify the person that you’re listening to, especially with accidental triggers – addresses, names and so on.The contractor argued Apple should reveal to users this human oversight exists – and, specifically, stop publishing some of its jokier responses to Siri queries. Ask the personal assistant “are you always listening”, for instance, and it will respond with: “I only listen when you’re talking to me.”That is patently false,, the contractor said. They argued that accidental triggers are too regular for such a lighthearted response.Apple is not alone in employing human oversight of its automatic voice assistants. In April, Amazon was revealed to employ staff to listen to some Alexa recordings, and earlier this month, Google workers were found to be doing the same with Google Assistant.The company values its reputation for user privacy highly, regularly wielding it as a competitive advantage against Google and Amazon. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas announcing that “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201ace3264e351852ddc37b2caf8d221e226139c/0_183_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f854a9ea52e0562728cd544bf21105b3","title":"whisky business how do you drink yours","story":"For too long a snobbery has lingered over how best to consume whisky. Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d13d5d6673f2aff8a582c6739de8ac0b2c6e203/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0254df179a2094ddf0019d85114efe0","title":"mueller testimony democrats impeachment","story":"The special counsel sent a clear signal impeachment is not the way to go, experts say, despite the many Democrats in favourCameras stood ready. Photographers crouched. Reporters sat elbow to elbow with laptops on knees. Congressmen and women waited in their seats expectantly. And in he came: Robert Mueller, the former special counsel dubbed “America’s straightest arrow”, a man whose silent mystique was such that it took Robert De Niro to play him on TV.This packed committee room on Capitol Hill, with its high ceiling, wood panelled back wall and gold-framed portraits of politicians past was, some hoped, to be the scene of Donald Trump’s downfall as Mueller talked through his report on Russian election meddling, point by devastating point. “We want Bob Mueller to bring it to life,” the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, had said.But once Wednesday’s seven-hour House committee hearings got under way, the welcoming smiles froze on Democratic faces, like a theatre audience realising they bought expensive tickets to the wrong show. It slowly dawned that Mueller was neither going to offer a pugnacious defence of his findings nor bring them into focus for the American public with piercing clarity. Instead the 74-year-old struggled, asking for questions to be repeated, laboriously looking up page references and offering halting, monosyllabic answers.Invited to deliver punchlines, he pulled his punches instead. When the New York congressman Hakeem Jeffries delivered a stirring soliloquy about defining obstruction of justice – “This is the United States of America! No one is above the law. No one. The president must be held accountable one way or the other” – and looked to Mueller for affirmation, the former FBI director replied: “Let me – let me just say I, if I might: I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that. I’m not saying it’s out of the ballpark, but I’m not supportive of that analytical charge.”Soon enough the reviews were in: far from bringing the report to life, it was a dying fall, one that revealed Mueller to be a mere mortal after all. The backlash was swift.Comedian Bill Maher wrote on Twitter: “I can’t watch this anymore. Go home, guys. You made OJ try on the glove, and it just didn’t work. You can still win the election, but I wouldn’t bet my own money on it.”Michael Moore, the Oscar-winning documentary film-maker, tweeted: “A frail old man, unable to remember things, stumbling, refusing to answer basic questions...I said it in 2017 and Mueller confirmed it today — All you pundits and moderates and lame Dems who told the public to put their faith in the esteemed Robert Mueller — just STFU from now on.”What went wrong? Why did Democrats not realise that Mueller would not only be a unwilling witness but seemingly unversed in his own report? And was it, as Republicans gleefully claimed, the kiss of death to both the Russia investigation and demands for Trump’s impeachment?Some of it was predictable. The former special counsel had cautioned in advance that he had no intention of embellishing the report he published three months ago. Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: “Mr Mueller made his intentions crystal clear. He was not there to be a player in anyone’s movie. The Democrats may have thought they had little to lose and that Mr Mueller may be goaded by the more pugnacious Republicans into a moment that would go viral.”Some of it was a shock. The Washington Post reported: “Many felt blindsided that no one warned them how much Mueller had aged – and regretful that they had forced a decorated Vietnam veteran and longtime civil servant into testifying when he was so reluctant in the first place.”The perceived flop left some suggesting that Democrats are now flogging a dead horse and should change direction. The New York congressman Anthony Brindisi told the Post on Thursday: “Anyone who was looking for the smoking gun yesterday didn’t get it. It’s time to move on and focus on getting some bills passed here that can get signed into law.”But Democratic leaders argue there is a principle at stake. It is their constitutional duty, they say, to chase down every lead in the Mueller report, call more witnesses and put it all before the public. Failure to do so would imply that Trump is above the law and set the worst possible example for future presidents.At a press conference, the Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings spoke passionately about the big picture: “Martin Luther King said … ‘There comes a point when silence becomes betrayal.’ And we refuse to betray generations yet unborn and the American people. We’re not going to betray them. We’re accumulating information and doing the best we can … We’re going to do our part to make sure that we have a democracy that’s intact.”To that end, the hearings did enable Mueller to refute, on camera, Trump’s claim that Russian meddling is a “hoax”, that the investigation was a “witch-hunt” or that it gave him “total exoneration”. In rare expressions of opinion, Mueller described Trump’s praise of WikiLeaks as “problematic” and gravely warned that Russia will continue to attack US democracy. Future historians may judge the transcripts damning for the president.Nearly a hundred House Democrats favour impeachment and presumably hoped that Mueller’s testimony would be a game-changer. But Shrum said: “I think Wednesday sent a clear signal that’s not the way to go. The president would do everything to resist, put up roadblocks and challenge it in court. I think the best way to defeat him is at the ballot box. At this point impeachment is a distraction.”Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “Mueller’s lacklustre testimony likely gave Speaker Pelosi the ammunition to withstand calls for impeachment inquiries, or hearings, from the left flank of her party. She has always maintained it is a losing political proposition even if the House voted to impeach Trump because the Senate will not vote to convict Trump and remove him from office.”Although Mueller did not generate enough sound bites to be used across media platforms in the election campaign, Schiller added, “the lurking danger for Trump is that among independent voters, who leaned toward him in 2016, there is discomfort with the way he conducts himself.“For now, the strong economy is insulating Trump against that discomfort, but any downturn in the economy next summer or in fall 2020 might lead those voters to either stay home, or vote for someone other than Trump. And in some swing states, that could be enough to cost him the election.”The Democrats seeking the presidency have been talking about healthcare, economic inequality and racial injustice and saying much less about Mueller or impeachment on the campaign trail.Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said: “I think the candidates on the stump are being politically realistic the people back in Washington aren’t. Nancy Pelosi, who is a wintry eyed realist, is having none of it: she thinks impeachment is a fools’ errand and I have to say I agree with her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440ffcd6c94dc3d6249264d623cae5063253a7e/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b318d0ecafe1b3e101112cd1b7d4d8","title":"morbidly sensible adulting no way getting life insurance is empowering","story":"Does the thought of tackling life insurance send you into a slumber? Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you? Then we can all get back to that boxset and tikka masala …For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003501bf842d860c771d35a01c2874fb6f4f636a/0_345_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009d93b11ef3388c8ae786cbbed83c7e","title":"can music unite a young nation","story":"A third of Latvia’s culture budget goes on music education and a new festival aims to galvanise national identity In the UK it is almost obligatory for a culture minister never to have attended an opera. In Latvia, a small country that takes these things very seriously, the newly installed culture minister hasn’t just seen plenty of operas, he’s starred in them.Nauris Puntulis a tenor who also had a successful pop career in his 20s, but is now the craggy, grey-haired minister-from-central-casting in the country’s centre-right coalition government.Latvia is proud of its musical traditions. Like Finland on the other side of the Baltic Sea, it produces a remarkable number of leading conductors and classical musicians for so small a country.This summer it is launching an annual music festival at the capital’s seaside resort, Jūrmala, designed to be more than just a moment of high culture but something of a rallying point for a country with a delicate historical and geo-political backdrop.Latvia and the other Baltic states had spent centuries as playthings of empires – Swedish, Polish, German and Russian. All it had to sustain itself was its language and a Lutheran choral tradition that remains vibrant and culminates every five years in a huge song and dance festival in Riga at which the combined choir numbered 17,000.The Latvian state lasted only 20 years before the country was occupied successively by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union once again after the second world war. Latvia has only been independent again since 1991. “It was our folk art culture that kept us alive under the Soviet occupation,” says Puntulis.There was, though, one beneficial byproduct of that almost 50-year Soviet occupation – the network of free music schools that have helped a country of just 2 million people to produce a battery of international classical music stars: conductors Mariss Jansons and Andris Nelsons opera singers Elīna Garanča and Kristine Opolais violinists Gidon Kremer and Baiba Skride and cellist Mischa Maisky. Grafting Soviet pedagogy on to Latvia’s choral tradition has produced a potent musical mix.In the UK, music education now relies on parents stumping up for private lessons. But Latvia has a network of 120 music schools, not just in the cities but in the countryside too, and one in 12 children attend them, usually between 3pm and 6pm after their general schooling is over.“The accessibility of the music schools is the pride of our nation,” says Puntulis. “A third of the culture budget goes into education.” Critics argue that it is too expensive and that the system should prioritise excellence over mass participation, but Puntulis is unconvinced. “We’re educating listeners as well as performers.”The new festival hopes to tap into that audience – in Latvia opera and classical concert prices tend to be lower than in the west and audiences younger – as well as attract music lovers from other countries.“The aim is to put Latvia on the map,” says the festival’s director Zane Čulkstēna, who also founded and still runs the contemporary art centre in Riga. “We want to get across the message that music has a special place here, and we are not from forests where we spend all our time picking mushrooms”, although mushrooms are indeed a national obsession in heavily forested Latvia.The festival is largely privately funded by a group of business people based in Latvia or who are part of the large Latvian diaspora that resulted from the tragedies of the 20th century. The chairman of the trustees is Petr Aven, a Russian businessman whose father was half-Latvian. Aven is worth an estimated $5.2bn so he can afford the logistical and financial burden of bringing four internationally renowned symphony orchestras and an array of soloists to Riga and Jūrmala on four weekends in July and August. But in future years, when the festival hopes to add extra weekends, he is looking for greater state support.“We are doing this for Latvia,” he tells me during the interval of the second of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra’s two concerts at Riga’s opera house. “Latvia is potentially a great country. It lost a lot of people during the second world war and in Soviet times, but it has a great environment and a great musical culture. We wanted to do something to distinguish Latvia from the rest of the world, but at some stage we hope the Latvian state will come in. If you want it to be sustainable, you need the state to participate.”Aven, eager to get back to the second half of the concert, is coy when I ask him why music matters so much to Latvians. “Why do they play football in Brazil? Why in France are there so many painters?” he says.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theBut the new president, Egils Levits, a judge at the European Court of Justice, who attends the festival’s gala opening, is happy to spell out its central role.Culture, he explains, was central to the survival of Latvian identity during the occupation and is just as important now in a digital age that threatens to atomise the population. “The choral movement has a big social role,” he says, “especially in the countryside, with people coming together over a period of years to prepare for the song festival.” The fact that the anti-Soviet movement of 1987-91 that led to the independence of Latvia and the other Baltic states was called the Singing Revolution underlines the social and political importance of the choir tradition.Like many politicians across Europe, Levits is worried about globalisation. He says the decline of solidarity and a shared identity – complicated in Latvia by the presence of both Latvian- and Russian-speaking populations – feeds alienation and social breakdown. Keeping musical and cultural traditions alive, making sure, as Puntulis says, that the concert hall is not entirely supplanted by the shopping mall, is accorded a significance unthinkable in the west. “In America, culture is something for the elite,” says Levits. “In Latvia it’s for everyone.”He realises that an emphasis on protecting the nation’s traditions can become nativist if taken too far, but says he is determined to guard against that. “It is possible to be introverted, to reflect about ourselves, but at the same time to be open to the world,” he insists. The ambition is to strike a balance between modernity and tradition, cutting-edge digital technology and vast choirs in national costume, though the number of audience members using their state-of-the-art mobile phones during concerts at the festival’s opening weekend suggests some misunderstand the nature of that balance.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He appealed to Hamas to implement the reconciliation agreements it signed with Fatah. “My hand is still extended to Hamas for reconciliation,” Abbas said.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad both released statements in the Palestinian press and on social media on Friday, in rare praise of Fatah.Mr Abbas also condemned Washington for backing Israeli policies and measures. “We won’t surrender to dictates,” Mr Abbas said, adding that Israel’s measures in Jerusalem were illegal and null and void.“The US administration, through its bias in favour of Israel and attempt to pass the Deal of the Century, is providing a cover for Israeli violations against our people,” he said. “We have rejected this and will continue to do so.”There was no official response from Israel to the Palestinian move but in the past Israel has warned that the PA has most to lose if security co-operation is suspended because without the almost daily arrests of Hamas and other militants, Fatah’s control over the West Bank would be undermined.It is unclear what the Palestinian decision will mean in practice and whether it will lead to the Palestinians formally revoking recognition of Israel, a key element of the 1993 Oslo peace accords, which lay the foundations for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3968688.1564162033!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"jacob rees mogg esq releases set of rules to new staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg (C) speaking in the Houses of Parliament flanked by Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson (L) and Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid.

A 33-year-old man has been arrested.Nathalie Birli, 27, was training with her bicycle on a road in Kumberg in southern Austria on Tuesday afternoon when she was abducted, Graz police spokesman Fritz Grundnig said. The attacker, whose name wasn\u0027t given according to Austrian privacy rules, was arrested on Wednesday.Birli said that she was on her bicycle when a car rammed into her and knocked her over, according to an interview published in local newspaper Krone on Thursday. She said she broke her left arm in the fall and the driver then beat her with a stick and threw her into the back seat.Birli, who has a 14-week-old son, said that she lost consciousness for a while, and when she woke up she was naked and tied to an armchair, Krone reported.He was full of hatred, she said. He blindfolded me, forced me to drink wine and schnapps and he always held a knife in his hand.Birli said at some point he held her nose and mouth and she thought he wanted to suffocate her but then stopped and forced her into a bathtub with cold water to drown me.She said the situation began to change when she saw that there were a lot of orchids in the house and she expressed her admiration for the plants.All of a sudden the attacker was nice to me, Birli told Krone. He told her that he was a gardener and started talking about his horrible life - a dead father, a mother addicted to alcohol and girlfriends who betrayed him, Birli said.Birli said that was the moment when she suggested a deal to the man.\u0027Let\u0027s pretend it was an accident,\u0027 I offered him, \u0027and you let me go.\u0027He agreed, took off the duct tape and drove her all the way home, she said.I went right into the house, locked the door and called my partner, Birli said.Police managed to track down the suspect and he was arrested early Wednesday by Austria\u0027s Cobra special forces.Birli, in a Facebook post on Wednesday, said the experience was like a bad movie and thanked all who went out looking for her when she was missing.Thank God I could liberate myself, and other than a fractured arm and a head injury, I\u0027m fine, she said. Man dies after \u0026#39horrific\u0026#39 hit and run in ChessingtonComment: Why I rejected the offer of a Ministerial post in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s glittering new governmentPompeo says willing to go to Iran as he calls on UK to join naval force in GulfAmerican tourist captured by Syrian regime on world trip is freedGirlguides shun learning about the history of the movement in favour of mocktail making badgesPrince William and Catherine\u0026#39s friendly rivalry steps up a notch - this time at Cowes WeekSlovakian criminal who mugged 12-year-old returned to the UK just months after deportation after changing his nameComment: Can Priti Patel make the Tories the party of law and order again?Best of The  in audio: Boris\u0026#39 first 100 days and the 5G futureSaudi Arabia plans futuristic desert city with robot maids, neon beaches - and alcoholBrexit latest: UK will be \u0026#39front of the line\u0026#39 if it seeks free trade deal with AmericaLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: Boris be warned, Northern Irish Unionism isn\u0026#39t what it used to be\u0026#39There are countless Nazanins\u0026#39: Student reveals psychological torture in Iran prison on charges of spying for UKVictoria and Albert Museum praises Extinction Rebellion for creating \u0026#39welcoming spaces for all\u0026#39Mother forced to undergo two rounds of chemotherapy after being wrongly diagnosed with cancer, when all she had was a rare skin conditionVegan restaurants are closing across the UK because not enough people follow the diet to sustain them, analysis findsNorth Korean economy shrinks at fastest rate in 21 years under US sanctions and droughtPro-democracy protesters flood Hong Kong\u0026#39s airport in bid to raise international pressureRise of lions as status symbols seen across Middle East as Conservationists warn of dangersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/23/TELEMMGLPICT000204554966_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"best telegraph audio boris first 100 days 5g future","story":"Boris Johnson shakes hands with defeated Tory leadership rival Jeremy HuntEvery Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.This week saw Boris Johnson enter No 10, and promptly embark on a speedy cull of Theresa May\u0027s cabinet.Our associate editor Camilla Tominey analyses what the new PM\u0027s appointments tell us about his plans for the country.While Daniel Capurro looks at what Mr Johnson\u0027s first 100 days in office could look like.Elsewhere, the Technology Intelligence team discussed what 5G means for the future of city surveillance and Julia Bradshaw looked at who actually owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas.Here are this week\u0027s recordings:To listen,  click the \u0027play\u0027 button of the recording you wish to listen to.Who owns the North Sea\u0027s oil and gas?Who owns the North Sea\u0026#039s oil and gas?Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership Analysis: What the new cabinet tells us about Boris Johnson\u0026#039s premiership NOA  The first 100 days: What can Boris Johnson get done?Boris first 100 days NOADystopia or Utopia: will 5G pave the way for increased city surveillance?5G: dystopia or utopia?

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well.

Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Some fans have been waiting up for six\u0026nbsphours to hear the new album.Other have been speculating that Kanye West’s involvement in the album could have led to its delay, given his reputation as a perfectionist.Chance the Rapper has been teasing the release of his new material on Twitter for weeks, writing “the day is on its way” and announcing a Spotify launch party which took place on Thursday night.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any reports otherwise have felt like an age-old attempt to pit us against each other and knock us down when, in truth, we had the best time making this!She told ET: “We won’t be knocked down. We will continue to share and celebrate this story together, as sisters. Thank you to all the fans for believing in us and supporting this film.”This is not the first time Wu has been accused of being a a. In May, she sent an expletive-ridden tweet after her ABC show Fresh off the Boat was renewed. She later explained her outburst, saying she was “upset” because the show’s renewal meant she had to “give up another project I was really passionate about”.Hustlers will be released in UK cinemas on 13 September 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel has positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm over patent licensing practices.Apple, based in\u0026nbspCupertino, California,\u0026nbspreached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker\u0026nbspnever formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signalling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple chief executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate – analysts call this\u0026nbspthe “Cook Doctrine”.“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have its own ready for use\u0026nbspby 2021.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where it sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on the firm\u0026nbspfor some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have independence, but they also realise it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s licence deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-licence deals.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company then issued updates at midday and 2pm, each time saying it was still finalising the report. The latest update is due at 4pm.\u0026nbspSports Direct shares seesawed during the day, falling in response to every update from the company.

In December, Sports Direct said the department store made a loss of £31.6m since it was acquired in August.When the company announced the first delay, it cited the complexities of integrating House of Fraser and uncertainty about the business’s future performance as part of the reason.“It not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run, but also could suggest a material problem with the numbers.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist.

Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’The unnamed 27-year-old was reportedly told by officials his behaviour was “not authentic” in a high-profile asylum case last year.The decision was the second time Austrian authorities had refused an asylum case on the grounds they did not believe the applicant was gay.The treatment of LGBT+ asylum seekers in Britain has also come under the spotlight\u0026nbspamid\u0026nbspreports of vulnerable\u0026nbspapplicants struggling to provide adequate proof of their sexuality.The proportion of asylum claims from members of the LGBT+ community that have been rejected by the Home Office has surged in recent years, government data released last year showed.In total, 78 per cent of asylum claims that included a reference to sexual orientation were refused last year 1,464 people – up from 964 rejected claims in 2015.This is what LGBTQI+ people go through to gain asylum in the UKDr Tschalaer’s study found people who were more open about their sexuality and gender identity in their country of origin as well as the country of arrival were much more likely to be granted asylum, in part because they were more likely to receive support for the preparation of their asylum interview.Her research suggested\u0026nbspthose who felt unable to be open about their sexuality prior to leaving their home country were at a disadvantage when applying for asylum.LGBTQI+ asylum seekers who felt forced to hide their sexuality andor gender identity, and who felt uncomfortable talking about it were usually rejected, as were those who were married or had children in their countries of origin,” she said.“This was either because they were not recognised or believed as being LGBTQI+, or because they were told to hide in their country of origin since they had not come out yet.”anti-LGBT+ countries in Europe, according to ILGA-EuropeLeila Zadeh, director of the UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group (UKLGIG), urged European governments to stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.She told The Independent: UKLGIG research has similarly found that the Home Office sometimes refuses refugee status to LGBTQI+ people who find it hard to speak about their sexual orientation.\u0026nbspThey told one person who they refused that their story was \u0027wholly lacking in compelling detail or any emotive terminology\u0027.\u0026nbspThis fails to recognise that in many parts of the world it is taboo to talk about emotions and relationships. People who do not conform to a society\u0027s gender norms may never have spoken about their sexuality or gender identity at all. European governments should stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a ‘coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So it gives the impression that there is more time to act.“Actions for both mitigation and adaptation of climate change needs to happen immediately. We cannot afford any more the business-as-usual approach for managing climate change.”\u0026nbspKarsten Haustein, of the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, said:\u0026nbsp“What this short but intense episode has shown is that the potential for 40C is there.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

HMS Montrose, a British frigate now in the area, carried out the first mission under the new policy on Wednesday evening.Mr Zonnour’s comments come a day after Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani suggested that the return of the Grace 1 would result in a reciprocal move from Iran.\u0026nbspIf Britain steps away from the wrong actions in Gibraltar, they will receive an appropriate response from Iran, Mr Rouhani said.\u0026nbsp Britain’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has yet to comment on the suggestion, but the solution was given backing by his father.Speaking to Press TV shortly after his son won the race to become Britain’s new PM on Wednesday, Stanley Johnson said he was looking forward to see Boris “building bridges with Iran and that it would be\u0026nbsp“easy peasy” to solve the crisis.“Of course you have this situation at the moment where we’ve got your ship which is called Stella, you’ve got our ship, which is called something else,” he said.“Well, the best thing would be to say, look, we let your ship go, you let our ship go,” he said.Relatives speak to crew onboard captured UK-flagged tankerThe crisis in the Strait of Hormuz has become part of a larger struggle between Iran and the US – and by proxy the UK – which was sparked when President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear deal.\u0026nbspTrump called the agreement “defective to its core” and has imposed several rounds of sanctions against Iran in an effort to forge a deal more favourable to the US. His administration justified the withdrawal by claiming increased pressure would further inhibit Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, which could be used for a nuclear weapons programme.The  European Union, which was also a signatory of the deal, has repeatedly stated that the deal was having the desired effect, and has made efforts to salvage the agreement.\u0026nbspBut that broader crisis shows no sign of being resolved.\u0026nbspTrump and Iranian leaders have both publicly said talks were possible, but the prospect for dialogue appeared to recede on Wednesday when the top military adviser to Iran\u0027s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali\u0026nbspKhamenei\u0026nbspsaid Tehran would not negotiate with Washington under any circumstancesUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said\u0026nbspThursday that he remains open to going\u0026nbspto Iran for talks.\u0026nbspAsked if he would be willing to go to Tehran, Mr Pompeo said in an interview with Bloomberg TV: Sure.

Its supposed to be a spiritual and meaningful time but thats got a bit lost in translation over the years.I feel that its become more about the huge parties, going down a bit of an American route like Sweet Sixteen parties.To bring the children back to their roots, she organised the trip with her daughter and a small group of friends.Each child picked a charity they wanted to raise money for and it would often be an organisation that meant a lot to them.Sarah said: One of the girls chose to raise money for Great Ormond Street because the hospital saved her le as a child.Another chose Age UK as one of her grandparents had Parkinsons.Jude Cannon, , one of the teens who embarked on the challenge raised a staggering £, for Meningitis Now after his own battles with the illness.He said: I wanted to raise money for Meningitis Now because meningitis is a very dangerous illness which can possibly kill you.Luckily, I didnt have the meningitis that could kill you but I was very ill. Meningitis Now helps people who have had meningitis whose lives were changed by meningitis.Amazingly, mine hasnt and I am able to climb mountains!Luckily my Dad made it up to the summit with me too!”Three years later the group of rambling friends has grown rapidly and Sarah said that she and her husband Matthew have now got a waiting list.In three trips the Bnei Mitzvah challenge has raised £, for the childrens vast range of charities.Sarah said: We started off as just a small group of parents and children who all knew each other, but in the most recent walk I didnt know anyone who was walking with us - it was amazing to see how much the idea had grown.We also ask that the kids are phone free, they are encouraged to get back to nature and get off their phones.The idea is that we have  kids and  adults per trip. My daughter is , she came this year as a helper because she loved it so much.Its a huge mixture of backgrounds and the kids have to pay £ to cover the travel and hostel. But for families who cant afford that weve set up a bursary to ensure everyone has the opportunity.When  you hear the kids stories about their chosen charities and hear the things theyve had to deal and what they want to give back, it really is amazing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So let’s not pretend I don’t need the show every bit as much as the Love Islanders deserve the low-grade abuse contained in this quiz, whichtests just how closely you’ve been watching.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry.

children’s vitamins firm Wellkid, said they remove the choice of sweets or dessert, confiscate their computer, games console and gadgets.Holding back a chunk of pocket money is also an option for many.Bribery is commonplace too, with  per cent offering to let their children stay up laterthey carry out a task, while  per cent offer extra pocket money as an incentive.It also emerged dads are the biggest pushovers at home with mums most likely to call the shots when it comes to the time children spend watching TV or playing computer games, the amount of sweets or fizzy drinks consumed and bedtime.Mums are most likely to lay down the law when getting children to do their homework, eat everything on their plate or try new foods.But dads are the strictest parents when it comes to dealing with their children’s behaviour and discipline.A spokesperson for Wellkid from Vitabiotics, said: “Unfortunately, it’s not always as simple as just asking children to do something, and then they do it.“Parents have to resort to all kinds of negotiations to persuade their children to behave in a certain way or eat the food which is put in front of them.“It’s just about finding something that works for you and your child.“But it seems mums are mostly to be the tougher parent when negotiating, with the results showing they are most likely to be the ones getting their children to do everything they should be doing, whether that’s their homework, eating a balanced diet or simply not spending all day glued to a screen.“But while dads may be adopting a more laid-back approach to

say mum decides how long children should spend watching TV or playing computer games in their household, with just one in five saying this is left to dad to police.Mums also call the shots when it comes to telling children how much food they should tuck into at mealtimes, what fruit and vegetables they eat and whether or not they are allowed to play computer games with older age ratings.But  per cent reckon dads are most likely to be strict at making sure children are well-behaved and face the consequencesthey aren’t, compared to  per cent who say mum.It also emerged more than one in

only way we can exit on time, but what would this mean for the UK and will we even leave the EU  Heres what we know.Boris Johnson said at the launch of his campaign that he was not aiming for a no-deal outcome for Brexit but the threat of no deal was a vital negotiation tool.He insisted the UK must do better than the deal served up by EU bosses.A No Deal departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship or any transition period.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers have been seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty led to the withdrawal agreement in November - but MPs rejected it in January.MPs rejected the deal two more times causing Mrs May to fail to meet the deadline of March .European Council President Donald Tusk agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until October , but MPs are keen to leave before that.Mr Tusk agreed to the extension on the condition that the UK stands in the European Parliament election, which was held May -.Boris Johnson said he will drop the Irish backstop and turbo-boost plans for a No Deal Brexit.He said his vision of a post-Brexit UK in  is as “the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe at the centre of a new network of trade deals”.“A time limit is not enough,” Johnson said. “If an agreement is to be reached, it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. he said.“For our part, we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU.”Johnson also said that the threat of a No Deal Brexit is an important bargaining tool.On March , MPs dramatically rejected crashing out of the European Union without a deal at any time and under any circumstances.Politicians voted  to  to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.But, its not a legally-binding decision, and doesnt rule out the UK leaving the bloc- especially now Boris Johnson is in charge.On May , Mr Tusk said thatthe  referendum was held again, that Brits would back Remain.The European Council president vowed to press EU leaders to delay our exit yet again beyond October  to give enough time for a fresh vote to be held.Theresa May vowed to block any chances of Boris Johnson achieving a No Deal Brexit by joining forces with Remainer pals Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, but with Johnson now PM this could be a possibility.May said she will stay as an MP for Maidenhead after stepping down as Prime Minsiter.The date the UK is due to leave the EU is currently October , , after another extension was granted.The European Commission has warned Parliament that voting against Brexit happening without a withdrawal deal in place isnt enough and that MPs must approve the deal, too.An official from the EUs executive branch said on March  that the bloc had already reached a orce deal with May, yet the House of Commons rejected it – twice.The PM had said it would be unacceptable to take part in the elections, more than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU.The PM was hoping to pass a Brexit deal with the help of Jeremy Corbyn, but ultimately cross-party talks collapsed.Brexit is now extended until October  so Britain can figure out a way to end the deadlock.On May , Mrs May made a speech saying she was stepping down as PM.With Johnson now as Prime Minister a no-deal Brexit could happena deal is not made before October .Jeremy Corbyn said The House has definitely ruled out no dealBrexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report and Boris has backed this.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Michel Barniers deputy Sabine Weyand has just been appointed as the EUs top trade official. Her promotion means that she will be in charge of the nuts and bolts of negotiating Brussels’ future trade deals, including with the UK.On June , a poll showed that about  per cent of Brits are less concerned with leaving the EU without a deal than previously thought.It was revealed on July , , a No Deal Brexit would mean checks on the border, which would dramatically affect the Irish economy.A new report on Ireland’s preparations for Brexit said that the consequences of the UK leaving the EU without a deal would be “profound”.It said it would pose risks for the Good Friday Agreement and political stability in the North.Jean-Claude Juncker’s designated successor has said the EU should delay Brexit againthe next PM asks for more time to find a way out of the impasse.Ursula von der Leyen said another extension could be granted “ good reasons are provided” - such as holding a general election or second referendum.In a letter to MEPs she vowed to build an “ambitious and strategic partnership” with Britain when she takes over the reins in November.But she insisted Theresa May’s withdrawal pact won’t be renegotiated and is the best and only possible deal for an orderly withdrawal.Her remarks will provide a boost to Remainer MPs who need the EUs help in their bid to block the next PM taking us out with No Deal on October .Ministers have previously announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Ministers also unveiled the post-Brexit immigration system, which will end preferential treatment for EU migrants.Johnson has tasked Michael Gove with preparing for a No Deal Brexit.He also assured the .million EU nationals living in Britain that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain.Pro-remain protesters rally

Carl Beech, once only known in media reports as Nick, was convicted of  counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. Beech made the claims of a Westminster VIP paedophile ring dating back to the s and s. The politan Police investigated his allegations, raiding homes and interviewing alleged suspects - but the £ million Operation Midland ended without making a single arrest. Northumbria Police was later tasked with investigating his claims. Beechaposs malicious deceit ruined the reputations of those he accused and led the politan Police to raid the homes of -year-old Normandy veteran Field Marshall Lord Bramall - the late Lord Brittan - and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.    Mr Proctor blasted the force, calling the episode a truly disgraceful chapter in the history of British policing. Speaking during his sentencing hearing, prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC said: In this case, the defendantaposs conduct amounted to the cynical manipulation of the criminal justice system on an unprecedented scale.He said that the offences demonstrated an unparalleled cruelty and disregard towards those who he wrongly accused.Mr Badenoch added: These offences were motivated by entirely selfish purposes.The prosecutor said that it was clear that Beech was aware that his accusations were of the most serious nature and that the stories he invented to detectives would be-front page news. He said: He also sought to inject himself into and thereby pervert the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse.  The prosecution has alleged Beech, , from Gloucester, deliberately and persistently lied to police and fraudulently claimed £, in criminal injuries compensation. The prosecution described him as a manipulative paedophile after telling the jury he has previously admitted downloading indecent images of boys, and voyeurism. Mr Badenoch said during the two-month trial that the orced father-of-one had shown breathtaking hypocrisy in accusing others of child sex abuse while he was pursuing an interest in boys himself. Beech told detectives over hours of tearful interviews how his late step-father, an Army Major, raped him, then passed him on to generals to be tortured at military bases and sadistically sexually abused by other Establishment figures in the s and s.  He named former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, his sworn enemy Mr Proctor, disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile and security chiefs Sir Michael Hanley, the head of MI, and MI boss Sir Maurice Oldfield among the gang after meeting a journalist from the defunct news agency Exaro. He claimed a schoolboy named Scott was deliberately knocked down and killed, that another boy who might have been the missing teenager Martin Allen was raped and strangled in front of him and said another youth was battered to death by the ring. Daniel Janner QC, whose father Lord Janner of Braunstone QC faced allegations before he died, said police must be held accountable after a jury ed guilty verdicts for the fantasist who ly claimed to have been a victim of a powerful VIP paedophile ring.

Iaposm tired of putting on a fake smile when Iaposm emotionally dying. It emerged the stimulant packet she bought had no warnings about dosage or excessive usage.

At an inquest coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of suicide and said: I have been a coroner sitting at this court for more than  years and this is the first ever death from caffeine toxicity which is a very unusual cause of death.    Sophia was a very bright and super intelligent young lady with a supportive family who did well on her uni course and she had a lot of support from the people in her flat.

She initially went to Sheffield university to study bioengineering, but she left in the first year and enrolled on a three year a biomedicine studies course at Salford in . Her father Jimmy Singh told the hearing: She was coping really well with it and she was in the top of her year. She would have got a first and there wasnapost any academic problem.

Instead he showed contempt for the Com­mons and the public by showboating when he should have been serious and blustering when he should have been straightforward. It is hardly surprising he is running from scrutiny when he has such a cavalier approach. He is recklessly driving us towards a no-deal Brexit without any care for the consequences. If we crash out it will put firms and farmers out of business, threaten medical supplies and force food bills to rise. Those who will suffer will not be the PM and his privileged friends but the towns and communities which can least afford it. What became clear yesterday is that Johnson is interested only in his own survival. His Brexit strategy has nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do with heading off Nigel Farage.  Hot and hotter Few on holiday will complain about yesterday’s record temperatures. The heatwave is also great news for our seaside resorts.

Fran Drake, now , struggled with her size for much of her le after turning to comfort food when cruel school bullies nicknamed her aposFat Franapos. Over the years she tried a handful of diets, including the : diet, but none of them kept the pounds off for long and she was stuck around a size . So she decided just to accept her body, and before long her confidence grew dramatically. She said: If I couldnapost change myself physically, I was going to change myself mentally.    Just because youaposre not a size  doesnapost mean you canapost be happy in yourself. And in  – then a size  - she started dating Matt after they got talking at a Christmas party. Bagging myself a fit man really reinforced the idea that I could be happy in my own skin without losing any weight,” she said. I was never confident when it came to dating before I met Matt. I always ended up with men that didnapost appreciate me and I thought I didn’t deserve any better because of my weight.    “But the problem was that after settling into a happy relationship and feeling more confident in myself, I started to eat more and more. Though her relationship with Matt was great, Fran saw her diet go from bad to worse and on a typical day, she would eat , calories a day – almost double the NHS recommended daily amount for women of , cals. Discussing Mattaposs naturally athletic build, she said: On nights out people would whisper, aposSheaposs punchingapos - like I didnapost know that he was in much better shape than me already. Things reached an all time low when she was flicking through photos from the trip of a letime to Walt Disney World, Florida, in April , and was reduced to tears at realising just how overweight she had become. From there, Fran, of Bournemouth, Dorset, ditched her diet of Pop Tarts and cheese-laden pasta bakes, and before long the pounds began to melt away. Now, she has shed a mammoth  stone, slimming to a  stone size eight – and has even fulfilled her ambition of becoming a trainee firefighter.  She said: I convinced myself before jetting off to Florida that Iaposd lost enough weight to finally look good on holiday, when in reality Iaposd lost a few pounds and was still grossly overweight. Now Iaposm healthier than ever, Iaposm finally training with the fire brigade and doing something meaningful with my le for the first time in what feels like forever. Since childhood, Fran, who married carpenter Matt on May ,  at Kingston Maurward, an th century mansion house in Dorchester, Dorset, has battled with her weight. As a result, she was teased mercilessly at school, which left her confidence in shreds. She recalled: Children have a knack for snfing out your biggest insecurity and making you feel  times worse about it. Unfortunately, my weakness wasnapost too hard to spot - my weight - and from the age of , I was referred to as aposfat Franapos or aposFatty-escaapos. I grew up in a household where,something was going wrong, youaposd cheer yourself up with something hearty and filling, and thataposs how I got locked into a vicious cycle.    After leaving school and landing a job working in patient services for the NHS, Franfell into a cycle of yo-yo dieting. By , Fran found herself squeezing into a size  and tipping the scales at  stone. That April, she and Matt booked to go to Walt Disney World and, though she was still feeling relatively confident, she decided to try her hand at dieting once more ahead of the trip. I was still very much of the mindset that I was happy with how I looked but wanted to be a bit trimmer for Florida, she recalled. I gave the : diet another whirl and was thrilled to lose a few extra pounds. “I managed to drop a dress size down to a , and I was actually really happy. “Florida was amazing too – the trip of a letime.”  But Fran’s dream holiday soon became a nightmare when, back in the UK, she decided to leaf through the photos she had taken and was left shocked at how she looked. I donapost know what it was about those particular set of photos, but it suddenly dawned on me thatI didnapost change now, my weight was going to kill me, she said. It all finally hit me, and I decided to overhaul my lestyle there and then. Signing up to her local slimming group in April , Fran swapped the junk food she had been living on for fresh home-cooked meals, veggie casseroles and fruit salads. Losing over six stone in a year, she was able to fit into a svelte size  corset dress by the time her wedding day rolled round in May . Remembering her special day, she said: Looking back, I canapost imagine what I would have looked like walking down the aisle in a size  wedding dress.    I can look back through my wedding day photos and smile at the happy memories without any self-loathing. Throwing herself into exercise, Fran also began hitting the gym three times a week, having regular personal training sessions. To fuel her workouts, she upped her protein intake with supplement brand Bio-synergy. Able to do things she never thought possible, from training in the gym to going on country walks with Matt, Fran found herself wanting to put her newfound fitness to use.

The mother-of-two went to the doctor who prescribed her a -day antibiotic course - but her condition worsened.    Taylor told WISH-TV News : Our first family vacation — what kind of luck is this ” She added: “I would say [the pain was] worse than labour. I don’t know what could be worse than that.” A huge blue and purple rash began spreading across her leg and she became increasingly unwell as the days passed. Her skin began to turn black and eventually peeled off as the rash spread upwards, causing her leg to swell and blister. Taylor went to hospital where doctors diagnosed her with pseudomonas folliculitis — a common skin infection that can become lethalleft untreated. She said: “Every night, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we were in the hot tub and [my doctor] was like, ‘That’s the only way I thought you could get this infection was from a hot tub.’ ”  The doctors said amputation was a possibilitythe infection failed to clear up. However, Taylor was cured after two weeks on IV antibiotics. She is now walking again but feels emotional when she recalls the pain she had to endure. Taylor added: At first I was thankful to have my leg but more so, thankful to be alive.” Folliculitis, also known as hot tub rash, is a common skin infection causing hair follicles to become inflamed.

Magdalena Dusza, from Krakow, Poland, adopted slimey pal Misiek after spotting in an appalling condition in a pet shop. Ever since she was a young girl she knew that she would rather have a pet snail over a cat or dog like most people. And despite the large amount of space Misiek takes up in her home - he has a -litre tank - Magdalena says it is very easy to look after him.  I had dreamed about owning a giant snail since I was in primary school, she said. We had similar snail in our biology classroom as a school pet, and I fell in love with these amazing creatures. Magdalena rescued Misiek - which fittingly is Polish for aposteddy bearapos - six years ago from the pet shop. She said: They kept him in a very small box, with low humidity, which is deadly for snails, and he had an invasion of parasites and damaged shell.  At first when I saw him, I couldnapost even recognise the species. I didnapost believe he would survive the night and didnapost want to pay for an almost dead animal. After a sleepless night, I decided that I have to give him a chance and rescue him. That day, I went back and bought him.  Misiek eats mostly vegetables and fruits. His favourites are sweet potatoes and bananas. He is also great fan of fish flakes food, Magdalena added. Snails do not have very complex nervous system, so we donapost interact in the traditional sense like a cat or a dog. However, this really doesnapost stop me from talking to Misiek every day.  Unfortunately, while most people are amazed by Magdalena having a pet giant African snail, some can be cruel with their comments towards Misiek. Magdalena said: There are also sometimes negative reactions, like people being disgusted. Sometimes they try to joke and ask meI am going to cook and eat my snails, but to be honest, it is not really funny at all.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d077b2511d578.29027818-e1560779961602.jpg ","title":"a look back at some of dundee uniteds most famous foes including messi and gazza","story":"Dundee United’s final friendly of the summer comes on Saturday when preparations for the build-up to the Championship season are completed with a -mile trip south to face Shrewsbury Town.The game will be a valuable exercise for boss Robbie Neilson as he makes sure his players have had enough game time to be ready for the opener against Inverness on Saturday week.In terms of prestige, there’s no denying the English League One opposition fall into the “modest” category.There was a time, though, when the Tangerines were in the habit of hosting top opposition at this time of year.It led to some great occasions – and great victories – at Tannadice. Today the Tele looks back at some of those memorable days.DUNDEE UTD  SPURS Tuesday, August , Att: ,A Spurs side that boasted the likes of Argentine World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, England’s Glenn Hoddle and the new strike partnership of Steve Archibald and Garth Crooks, were blown away by a United side that would reach the peak of its powers over the next few seasons.The Londoners started well and led through a Crooks goal as early as the th minute but, by the break, Billy Kirwood had levelled.After the interval, Jim McLean’s men stepped up a gear and goals from Graeme Payne, Derek Addison and Paul Sturrock gave them a handsome victory over a team that, within a year, would win a classic FA Cup Final against Manchester City.DUNDEE UTD  ASTON VILLA Sunday, August , Att: ,A year before that superb display against Spurs, United entertained Aston Villa, with striker Paul Sturrock once again to the fore.With United dominating from start to finish, “Luggy” bagged a hat-trick to send Ron Saunders’ outfit heading back south with their tails between their legs.If not too much was made about the victory, it was a sign the Tangerines were on the verge of big things and, within months, McLean’s team would secure the club’s first major honour in the shape of the League Cup.It’s also worth remembering, in just two years, Villa would be champions of England and, a year later, more than half the team that ran out at Tannadice would start their winning European Cup Final against Bayern Munich.DUNDEE UTD  EVERTON Tuesday, July , Att: ,.This game was a testimonial for long-serving Maurice Malpas, with his influential former coach Walter Smith bringing Everton to mark the occasion.If the English Premier League giants were already a sizeable draw, their signing of Paul Gascoigne, who would make his debut, brought extra attention that saw news as well as football media heading for Tannadice, although tragic events in Paris as a Concorde crashed, meant, ultimately, actual coverage of it was limited.As was often the case with Gazza, trouble was not far away. He had a first-half flare-up with Joachim Fernandez that saw the home trialist take such exception that boss Paul Sturrock took him off before he was sent off.Malpas’ big night was marked with a win, David Weir giving the visitors the lead before two goals in three second-half minutes from Steven Thompson and Alex Mathie turned things round.DUNDEE UNITED  BARCELONA Saturday, July , Att: ,For the second year running, the Catalan giants had used United’s St Andrews University training base for the first week of their pre-season build-up and that meant fans were treated to a second summer friendly in a row against them at Tannadice.A year earlier, minus Lionel Messi because he was still on holiday, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry were the stars as a last-gasp goal by the French great gave them victory.With Messi starting, the  friendly saw the Spaniards really turn up as they blasted five past the Tangerines .For once, though, such a reversal was surely acceptable, such was the quality of the opposition and just the sight of one of the world’s greatest players in action meant everyone went home happy.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

The results, by authors including Darren McGarvey, Orwell Award-winning author of Poverty Safari, have a distinctly sci-fi feel but are all based on technologies with us now or coming soon. In the four vignettes, cash is a distant memory and roads are dominated by driverless transport. Deliveries are all done by drone and language has narrowed to a kind of universal speech recognised by AIs like Alexa.The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce ndash to give it its Sunday name ndash might dispute that all four of the stories it has commissioned are dystopian.One by Orwell Prize winner Delia Jarrett-Macauley is designed to consider how automation could go hand in hand with responsible employment and a partnership with workers and unions. Nevertheless it is far from utopian .By confronting us with the possible outcomes of imminent technological advances, the RSA hopes to get us all thinking about what kind of use we want to put them to. We could, it says, ldquoagitate for a more socially just and egalitarian future for ourselves and our children.I approve of the sentiment. I just wonder how realistic it is. TVrsquos Black Mirror has already explored similar topics and I donrsquot see a huge degree of response ndash beyond a horried fascination at some of the scenarios suggested by the seriesrsquo writers.I think we generally feel pretty powerless to do much about a lot of this. Perhaps the most visible sign of technology making people redundant is at the automated supermarket which have all but wiped out a whole class of workers. Particularly committed shoppers may seek out real cashiers, where they are still available, but most of us have succumbed.Lots of people rail against the suspect domestic surveillance involved in owning AI devices like Echo and Echo Dot which may record some of your interactions and send them to Amazon bosses ndash but the company has sold more than  million of them.In some sectors, potential problems and solutions are being more vigorously debated. Take the ethical and practical questions raised by driverless cars.A recent survey by the Law Commissions of England and Scotland asked people to consider whether driverless cars should be allowed to lsquoinch throughrsquo areas crowded with pedestrians. A majority thought they should. But for that work they would need to be programmed to have some degree of credible threat of injury written into their code.And the Faculty of Advocates considered similar questions in February. ldquoPersons generally are entitled to expect that a self-driving vehicle will not collide with and injure them. However, in reality, the situation is much more nuanced their report said. If a vehicle had no option but to choose between striking a group of people in the road or a single inidual on the pavement, it might have to make that choice, the Faculty suggested. Personally I canrsquot see how this canrsquot ultimately result in the phasing out of the one truly unpredictable factor ndash human drivers.The general public, however, is not discussing any of this while ndash as the technology rushes ahead ndash car manufacturers and their lawyers and insurers seem primarily concerned about who will be liable when things do go wrong.It would be wrong to deny the upsides to all this. Robots and computer programmes could eventually carry out all the tedious, dirty or dangerous jobs humans dislike, freeing us up for fun tasks or more leisure time. The World Economic Forumsays automation will lsquodisplacersquo  million jobs but create  million new ones by .Some jobs can never be done by robots ndash writing poetry, for example, care tasks requiring empathy, roles requiring great creativity. .Not all agree with the WEF. In a survey of more than  Chinese executives two thirds said they expected to employ far fewer people in the future. As we see wine companies moving their businesses online, robot people cold calling us and check-in for travel without interacting with a human being at all, this seems more convincing.So we distract ourselves with Love Island and hoverboarding Frenchmen.

My view then was that centre-right Scottish politics needed a great disruption. My relationship with political parties is not emotional rather it is entirely transactional. They are a means to an end a vehicle to construct a government. When that vehicle is sitting in a ditch, written off, the sensible thing to do is to get a hold of a new vehicle rather than trying to jump into the wreckage and make it go.Eight years have passed, and I have three core reflections. The first is that Ruth Davidson has been a very accomplished and successful leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, but should would have been an iconic, generationally memorable leader of the party that her opponent wanted to create. Let us remember that Ruth Davidson consistently beats Nicola Sturgeon in head-to-head approval ratings, but her party, a ball and chain to her, can only muster a little over half of the SNPrsquos percentage.My second reflection is that, with my hands held up, I now realise that our proposal would not have worked. It was as radical as we thought the members could handle, but with hindsight, not enough.:SNP say Ruth Davidson lsquohumiliatedrsquo after David Mundell sacked against her adviceA party explicitly formed to take the whip of the Tories at Westminster would have been easily caricatured as Tories in all but name, and perhaps with some justication. Rather than a CDU CSU type of model, what I would now propose is a Canadian model, whereby the Conservative party stands in Scotland at Westminster, but a new, separate, unconnected and unrelated party stands at Holyrood. As well as creating the conditions for a governing party at Holyrood, it would assuage those Tories at Westminster who felt that taking the Tories out of Scotland entirely is lsquoun-unionistrsquo.My final reflection is that, although I thought at the time that this was a problem confined to the Conservative party, I now realise it is not. The SNPrsquos success over the last  years has been predicated on exploiting the  v  mentality wersquore Scotlandrsquos party, and theyrsquore Londonrsquos parties in Scotland. The Scottish Tories are buffeted by the winds of Westminster, for sure, but they are not alone.The Lib Demsrsquo woes following the coalition years were felt in  at Westminster, but also  and  at Holyrood. Labourrsquos calamitous uncertainty over Brexit, and its anti-Semitism crisis, are savaging its polling numbers in Scotland it came th with less than  per cent of the vote in the European Parliament elections. The Canadian model is one which all parties should observe and act upon.Since  the concept of a separate Scottish party has come and gone. If we charted its progress, it would be very obvious to see that its stock increases in times where the Tory party at Westminster is in trouble, and decreases at times when the mothership is doing well. In the immediate aftermath of Davidsonrsquos victory, the idea went back into its box.The independence referendum came at a perfect time, as it gave Davidson something to hold on to. She did so with efficiency and vigour, becoming the head of unionism in Scotland and, critically, keeping the issue firmly on the table during the  Scottish Parliament elections and the  Westminster General Election Sturgeon does.But as sure as night follows day, when you run downwind at times of relative calm at Westminster, you are going to have to turn around and run with it in your face. Brexit has produced a stf headwind for the Scottish Tories, and the inability of the Westminster government to deliver it has cost the Scottish party at least five points, so far, in the polls.Enter Boris Johnson, and now it is blowing a gale. The Scottish Tories saw this coming. Last year, they ran a clandestine campaign codenamed Operation Arse, aimed at persuading MPs to prevent Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister. The driver was the partyrsquos internal polling it showed Johnson to be unpopular across all Tory voters ndash the core,  switchers and  switchers. He was the least popular of all known leadership candidates at that time. His favourability was - at a time when Theresa Mayrsquos was still +, and Davidsonrsquos +.Operation Arse has failed. And, to make matters worse, Davidsonrsquos ally David Mundell has been sacked, leaving her spitting tacks. So, what now  I suspect that Davidson will do and say very little publicly between now and late-August. She will then re-convene her MSPs and that will be, to borrow a phrase, do or die.:SNP mavericks try to revive independence Plan BUltimately, this is about . Talk used to be of emerging from that election as the largest party. It is now of winning enough seats to stop an SNP Green majority and the second independence referendum that will have to follow to avoid a democratic outrage. It may yet be an issue of simply retaining enough MSPs to be relevant.The question for Ruth Davidson is how to maximise her vote in . It is likely to have only one answer. Boris Johnson is exactly the sort of Tory Nicola Sturgeon wants in Downing Street - a posh, rich, southern Tory who led the Leave campaign and has a streak of English nationalism running through him.But therersquos something Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want. Decentralisation. She doesnrsquot want Boris Johnson to create a quasi-federal arrangement whereby the Scottish Parliament is offered all the powers that most peoplewant. And she doesnrsquot want Ruth Davidson to create a new party which can argue from a Scotland first perspective, with no ties to the Tories.Davidson and Johnson donrsquot agree on much. But they should agree on this."},{"url":null,"title":"trans-rights-questions-yaniv-male-genitals-waxing-case-must-answered-scotland","story":"Concerns frequently pooh-poohed as misleading nonsense, the sort of scaremongering that never happens in real le. Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman. The woman was a rape victim and felt frightened at being in close quarters with a male-bodied person who was \"masc presenting\", that is, maintained a beard and wore typically masculine clothes.There was no suitable alternative space in the refuge and so the woman was asked to leave. This is another scenario women have raised questions about but been given no clear answers.Scottish Womens Aid and Rape Crisis have both made statements saying they are in support of self ID. Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-anyone-lady-windermere-39-s-fan","story":"ONE of the hottest days in Britain yesterday.

Itrsquos still a very holy isle.Whatrsquos Harry Potter got to do with it Some headlines have referred to the boy wizard because Loch Shiel features as the Black Lake in the Harry Potter movies and the isle is by Glenfinnan, where filming for the second and third Harry Potter movies took place, with Glenfinnan Viaduct making a star appearance on the silver screen.How signicant is the loss of the bell Scottish culture and heritage historian Professor Hugh Cheape described it as a ldquohorrible catastrophe, adding: ldquoI have thought a lot about St Finan over the years and how he took on leprosy as a penance.\"He would have sailed up Loch Shiel with only his hand bell and a staff as the early Christian saints did. I canrsquot put myself in the mind of someone who would take it.The bell is cursed Mr Cheape has warned the culprit could indeed be in danger. He said of the bell: ldquoItrsquos known to be cursed. One of the Government soldiers after the  rebellion went off with it to Fort William, where the bell turned round, beat him up then flew back to St Finanrsquos isle with the villagers hearing it clanking through the air.Police inquiries are ongoing.A Police Scotland spokesman said: \"The bell was removed from the uninhabited island sometime between late June and early July.

This is a lady so socially enlightened that until  she supported restoration of the death penalty. She has voted in favour of repealing the Human Rights Act, is in favour of reducing welfare payments to the terminally ill, sick and the disabled. However, most egregiously she was dismissed as Secretary of State for International Development when she was found to have held numerous meetings with Israeli government officials to discuss official business without informing the Foreign Office, a clear breach of the Ministerial Code. Some law and order appointment, Mr Johnson.But even more worrying are two aspects of Mr Johnsonrsquos speech on arrival at  Downing Street. First, that he is already lining up for blame anyone who does not share his views or is unwilling to come along on the journey he proposes to take us on. Those of us who hold genuine concerns, our own legitimate disagreements and certainly anyone who gives voice to our criticism, will be blamed as ldquothe doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters. Who knows what is next  Fth columnists Secondly, we will not be the only targets of Mr Johnsonrsquos blame claims. The EU itself is being lined up. He delineated his position with regard to the backstop in just one phrase ndash ldquowe refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop. Andthe Europeans refuse to go along with this, ldquowe are forced to come out with no deal. Thus, on the one hand the European Union is presented with a diktat, and on the other hand will be responsible because they would not lsquoobey his diktat. My way or the highway, Michel Barnier.There will certainly be little sign of opposition in Cabinet as such as the Foreign Office , Treasury , Education , Business , Commons Leader , Duchy of Lancaster , and our own new Secretary of State , have all been either enthusiastic Leavers all along, or made clear they would now countenance leaving the EU without a deal. Johnsonrsquos might have been the ldquothe bloodiest cull of a Cabinet in modern political history, but it has allowed him to surround himself with minions who will do his bidding.A Prime Minister lining up the targets for blame when he fails, before he even goes through the door of No  supported by the uncritically like-minded. All in the first few hours. What could go wrong Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WHEN Winston Churchill became Prime Minister, at an even more desperate time for our country, he famously said: \"Power, for the sake of lording it over fellow creatures or adding to personal pomp is rightly deemed base, but power in a national crisis, when a man believes he knows what orders should be given, is a blessing.\" So far, Boris Johnson behaves ashe is seeking power, specically the top job, for its own sake.We have yet to seehe really knows what orders to give, as distinct from blind belief in his own ability. More worryingly, Churchill had the honesty to face the nation with the truth, the need for blood, toil, tears and sweat instead our new Prime Minister offers a pain-free Brexit, jam today and still more jam tomorrow.Peter MD Gray, Aberdeen AB.MANY years ago, when Boris Johnson was a cub reporter for an English broadsheet, he wrote an article concerning an archaeological find on the south bank of the River Thames of a house built in the mid-s for Edward II, wherein he was to enjoy a le \"of wine and song\" with his favourite, Piers Gaveston. Of course, said favouritehad got his head cut off in . Now, Edward may have been a strange man but I sincerely doubt he was that strange.The moral of this tale is, of course, that Mr Johnson does not \"do detail\".Hence what happens now depends largely upon the quality of his advisors.Brian D Finch, Glasgow G.FEW Prime Ministers,any, can have entered  Downing Street with such a mendacious, arrogant, libidinous past. What on earth has Great Britain come to  Heartily endorsed by President Donald Trump as Britainrsquos Trump, his position is secure. But requesting America for assistance to protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz received the answer that we should look after our own ships and we have now formally requested Europe for a European-led mission to protect Gulf shipping.If Mr Johnson manages to fulfil his ambition to drag us out of the EU on October  then we will not be, as he has said, a ldquoslumbering giant but rather an insignicant, small island stranded in the Atlantic convenient to the United States as a remote aircraft carrier ndash USS Great Britain. We now have trade agreements with Chile, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Antigua, Bahamas, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and sundry others but after three years there are still more than  countries to go and that includes the really important ones.What an exciting prospect.Nigel Dewar Gibb, Glasgow G.I FIND an unexpected spring in my stride. I whistle a happy tune, crying out What-Ho! and Huzzah! as I look forward to the veritable feast anticipated on Halloween. Shrink-wrapped kippers chlorine-washed chicken and best of all, nourishing full fibre broadband, all washed down with a sugary milk-shake. Whats not to like Must dust down that catchy tune that was on everyones lips in . How did it go: \"Things can only get better\". Aye, right ndash far right, too.Graeme Orr, Neilston.WOULD that the Tory rump had someone of the calibre of Bertie Wooster to turn to . Not only is he of irreproachable moral probity and possessed of a command of English as impressive as his acuity of observations, but he has the sense and humility to delegate the resolution of apparently insoluble problems to someone who, without seeking either adulation or material advantage, can be relied upon to ldquoendeavour to give satisfaction.A better comparison to Boris Johnson would be the generally odious Spode ndash or perhaps best of all ndash the pathologically self-centred Lord Dunstable.Robin Dow, Rothesay."},{"url":null,"title":"doug-marr-teachers-run-schools-39-football","story":"The ,-dollar question is why we no longer produce international standard players. Not too long ago there was a regular debate about whether Jim Baxter and Denis Law could be accommodated in the same Scotland team. I once asked Denishe and Baxter could play together for Scotland. His eyes twinkled as he replied, ldquoProbably not, wersquore both in our fties now.The one bright spot is girlsrsquo and womenrsquos football. The relative success of the womenrsquos game is largely due to the increased numbers of girls playing from an early age. Schools deserve some of the credit. In my neck of the woods, Mintlaw Academy was on the ball, winning the national girlsrsquo senior trophy on five occasions. Arsenal and Scotlandrsquos Kim Little is only one of the Mintlaw alumni who has gone on to greater things.In contrast, boysrsquo participation has stagnated. Much of that stems from the decline in schoolsrsquo football, especially at secondary. As a teacher in the s, our school fielded five or six teams every Saturday. There was a waiting list for teachers to manage the teams. Despite lacking both a playing field and formal coaching qualications, we produced a host of professionals, a few internationals and the scorer of the winner in a European final.Those days are gone for good. Teachers have discovered the golf course and BQ. The decline of schoolsrsquo football is not due to a lack of facilities. I once asked the head of a new school why the all-weather pitch was deserted at break times. I despaired when told it was ldquohealth and safety.Football may not be a matter of le and death, butitrsquos our highest profile national sport, success contributes to our collective feel-good factor. We need to get our young people, especially boys, playing again in much greater numbers. We have a captive audience in schools with first-class facilities. The missing pieces are the modern equivalents of the hundreds of teachers who willingly gave of their time and sorely missed inter school competition.Successive SFAndashdriven strategies have brought no perceptible improvement at club or national levels.

But this does not trigger changes in funding for England or the other regions.: Boris Johnson under pressure over attacks on Scotlands public spendingOf all the regions, Northern Ireland received the most spending per head , followed by Scotland , Walesand England .The report has recommended that at future spending reviews, the Treasury should publish more detailed and transparent information about its funding decisions and explain how it has ensured that funding decisions are prioritised according to the needs of citizens across the UK.\"This should include evidence of its assessment that the current block grant continues to be the optimum way of allocating funding to meet the needs of the UK as a whole,\" the report recommends.The committee has also recommended that the Treasury should write to it with analysis of the funding and share \"timely information\" with the devolved regions.: Boris Johnson accused of dubious u-turn after backing Barnett Formula after previous criticismA Scottish Government spokesman said: \"This report makes clear that the UK Governments decisions on devolved funding are not transparent and we have no clarity on the impact of spending announcements until the Treasury decides where the money will come from.\"The Scottish Government is no further forward than we were three months ago in knowingthere will be a UK Spending Review in  and it is crucial that the UK Government confirms its intentions so all devolved administrations have clarity.\"An HM Treasury spokesman said: \"We will consider the findings of this report.\"We are very transparent about the amount of funding we provide for the devolved administrations -

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything.

The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

Five months on, with no progress having been made, I want to challenge Mr Kerr to put his country and his constituency above party and back another referendum on Brexit. In the  referendum,  per cent of voters in Stirling backed Remain, higher than the  per cent figure in Scotland as a whole. Despite this, Mr Kerr’s team told me he would continue to facilitate Brexit. They argued that in  he was elected on a Conservative party manesto that promised to “respect the referendum”. I understand this.Yet, circumstances have changed. With any form of ‘sensible’ Brexit deal being blown out the water, it looks like the Conservative party is going to attempt to enforce the hardest possible Brexit upon Remain-voting Stirling. I am sure Mr Kerr has seen the recent YouGov survey revealing that Conservative members are willing to endure the collapse of the party itself, an economic crash and even the break-up of the UK in order to secure Brexit.: Brexit fears for sterling spark sharp warning to traders: Why it looks like Boris Johnson is planning to destroy Brexit Party – John McLellanI now find myself asking, where are the Scottish Conservatives in all of this  Are they happy to sit back and witness this collective loss of rationality and support the ‘Brexit-at-any-cost’ mentality that has gripped both their party and large parts of the UK This kamikaze approach would perhaps be understandablethe end result was something worth having. Yet a no-deal Brexit, which appears to be all but government policy, would be devastating for Scottish industry. For example, the drinks giant Diageo has already announced shts of production out of Scotland to the EU. This month, Deutsche Bank announced it is cutting jobs across the UK, having previously said it would move assets from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit. And the Scottish National Farmers Union has just raised serious concerns on behalf of its members about how lower food safety standards could put farmers livelihoods at risk. Is this what Stephen Kerr and the Scottish Conservatives would be happy to sacrice Finally, and most importantly for the Conservative and Unionist Party, polls in recent weeks highlighted that Scots would vote for independenceBoris Johnson became the next UK Prime Minister. With Tuesday’s announcement rendering this horror story a reality, an independent Scotland appears increasingly likely. Scots will not accept a botched deal by Boris or a cataclysmal no-deal Brexit. The Scottish Conservatives are very proud to call themselves the unionist party of Scotland. Surely, they are not so committed to any form of Brexit that they will put their party’s raison d’être in existential danger I understand Mr Kerr’s hesitancy about any form of a People’s Vote or confirmatory referendum as he feels he was elected on a manesto that promised not to offer this.However, I cannot understand how on Earth the Scottish Conservatives can continue to facilitate a disastrous Brexit that will be hugely damaging to Scotland’s economy and risks breaking up the union they are so proud of. Therefore, I ask, on behalf of young people in Scotland, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, to at the very least publicly state your opposition to a destructive no-deal Brexit.Ailie Ross-Oliver is a campaigner with the Our Future Our Choice group©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"letters why does nicola sturgeon refuse to respect the 2014 indyref vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots made a decision on independence in , why does Nicola Sturgeon not respect the vote result, a Scotsman reader writes.In her letter to Boris Johnson, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: “The right of the people of Scotland to determine their own future is a basic democratic principle that must be respected.” : Nicola Sturgeon writes to Boris Johnson: ‘We will give Scotland independence choice’For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here\u2028The people exercised this right in  and determined that we should stay within the United Kingdom.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities.

They’ll be the support act.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

provocative to unionists.The Taoiseach added Ireland’s negotiating aim for Brexit is to maintain the status quo on issues like cross-border trade.The country is not using the issue to leverage constitutional change in Northern Ireland, he said.“If there is a hard Brexit on the st of October,the UK takes Northern Ireland out of the EU against the wishes of the majority of people of Northern

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors. The garden party lasts from pm to pm, with an entrance fee of pound..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businesses boost for Downpatrick  ","story":"A NEW group has been formed to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street in Downpatrick.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials met last week with traders and politicians to discuss how to spend the money on business improvements at a part of a town where work on a protracted pound, public realm scheme was completed at the end of June.The revitalisation funding is being provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help Irish Street business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward was formed at last weekrsquos meeting with the news that funding is being made available welcomed by Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon.Cllr Curran hopes that traders will come up with schemes to improve shop fronts and is hoping they will seek professional help in order that any planning applications which may have to be lodged are approved.ldquoIrish Street traders were put through the mill during work on a public realm scheme which lasted six months instead of three, he said.ldquoNow that the work has been completed, apart from a promised resurfacing project, it is time businesses at this part of Downpatrick are allowed to get on with the job of meeting the needs of a wide range of customers.Cllr Curran has promised to provide the new working group with all help and support and hopes that all Irish Street businesses will get involved in the revitalisation scheme.He also highlighted the importance of retaining the character of this part of the town and said this is something that the business community is acutely aware of.Cllr Curran said given plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings, much focus will be on Irish Street.It emerged last week that work to secure all the necessary land required to advance the project may not be purchased until the end of the year.While the former police base has already been purchased, there are a number of adjacent buildings and pockets of land which need to be bought.The old police station enjoys protected status and will remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are driving the regeneration project, with suggestions that the old police station could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Council officials are determined to deliver the major scheme and are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its potential.Once the ious land and buildings have been acquired, a development brief will be compiled and sent out to seek expressions of interest from the private and commercial sectors.Cllr Curran added: ldquoI hope we reach this stage in the process soon and that once expressions of interest come in, the Downpatrick business community will be briefed and asked for its input.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group.
