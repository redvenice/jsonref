But that, as any writer who has visited Italy on a deadline could have told her, is easier said than done.A novelist and an academic at an American university, Jan is thus far a safe bet as avatar for the prizewinning Martin herself – though this assumption, as so many in this beautifully fractal novel, is challenged and unpicked as the narrative progresses. Jan knows only the name of a fellow academic, the glamorous fiftysomething Beatrice Salviati, from whom she is renting the Villa Chiara’s orangery. From her terrace in the limonaia, with “access to scenes no one else saw”, Jan is both on the edge of things and screened from view: the ideal novelist’s vantage point. She cannot stop herself from making notes, not on Mussolini but on her setting: the meals, the landscape, “the sweet sound of doves cooing”, the great house she overlooks and most importantly the comings, goings and secretive doings of the Salviati family.Thus when Beatrice arrives a week into her stay and proceeds with coolly elegant amusement to bestow both friendship and stories from the Villa Chiara’s history – of mysterious violent death, of madness and war and love and exile – there is little hope for Mussolini and every prospect of a melodrama of the Italian nobility emerging from the notes Jan sketches out on her terrace. “Do you like it?” says Beatrice, of her first anecdote. “I give it to you.” Which Jan perceives as generosity, but which has another implication: that the story is not hers to take.Slyly, seductively, teasingly, extended over a friendship that lasts a decade and more, Martin’s novel threads together Jan’s beguiled interpretation of her hostess’s life – Beatrice’s childhood in wartime Florence her escape to America and her doomed marriage her cousin’s torment at the hands of his fascist father her mad uncle’s incarceration and his death on the steps of the Villa Chiara – and embeds it in a wider narrative that includes a leisurely, amused analysis of the creative process and its ongoing battle with the intrusions and outrages of “real life”, the daily existence that is banal and demanding and – just occasionally – stranger than fiction.There are several games to be played here around the mental gymnastics of the novelist’s life, and all of them are enjoyable. Jan – eager, talkative, forever off on tangents – falls in love, as so many have before her, with a culture more exotic and more apparently exciting than her own. She is so involved in her own imaginings that she overlooks the casual dramas playing out discreetly, stage left: the servants quietly conniving to become masters, the infatuations and seductions and the grasping relatives.There are the plot puzzles to be solved: the unmasking of the guilty – the traitor, the murderer, the liar – the rooting out of the most intimate secrets, the working out what is “truth” and what Jan cannot possibly know. There is the tension, always, between reality and fiction: however insistently Jan spins her gossamer spell around Beatrice, the Italian remains an enigma however longingly Jan gazes at the blue Tuscan horizon she will always be interrupted by burst pipes, and the need to meet a deadline for the novel that no longer interests her. There is, too, the vexed question of ownership, and of how far the creative intelligence can, may, or must wrest control of actual lives and turn them to its own purpose in the name of art.But finally and in answer there is the pure pleasure of the stories themselves, that are neither Beatrice’s nor Jan’s, but that thing called fiction. At once braced and embraced by their sturdy frame of ironical, philosophical and creative inquiry, cleverly plotted and packed with great characters, both Jan’s creative struggles and her beautifully wrought stories of the Salviati family lift themselves effortlessly free of their source material, whatever or wherever that may be. They demonstrate the enchanted moment when words on a page rise by virtue of the alliance of a mysterious grace and sheer hard work, and create magic.• Christobel Kent’s The Viper is published by Corvus.

The recommendation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is for staff to continue to work from home where possible.It is unclear whether the UK’s slower return to the office could be related to the earlier impositions of lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions in the four other European countries.In all five European countries, office workers have continued to work remotely for longer than employees based in other kinds of workplaces.Technology, including high-speed internet and video conferencing apps, has enabled successful working from home for many companies which usually occupy offices, and as a result firms have been more reluctant to ask their employees to return.Workers in London are much more likely to continue to work remotely than their counterparts in other European capitals including the Paris region, Madrid, Berlin or Rome.The Morgan Stanley survey was conducted in mid-July, before the government updated its guidance for businesses.Boris Johnson told companies in England it would be up to them to decide from 1 August when and how to bring back staff and also scrapped the previous guidance to avoid public transport.However, recent analysis by the  showed that several of Britain’s largest office occupiers have not heeded the government’s call.Many companies cited uncertainty about asking their employees to use public transport and the need for childcare during school summer holidays as reasons not to end remote working before September at the earliest.The government is keen to get workers back into corporate buildings to support smaller businesses in many towns and cities, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners, that provide services to the country’s army of office workers.High street retailer WH Smith announced on Wednesday it would cut 1,500 jobs because of struggling sales in its travel business, which includes branches at airports, as well as small kiosk-style stores in bus and railway stations.Sandwich chain Pret a Manger said in July it would permanently close 30 outlets and could cut 1,000 jobs after sales plummeted as a result of continued working from home.Workers across mainland Europe have similar views on where and how they will work in future.Yet employees’ desire to work remotely does not necessarily spell the end of the office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03bd56c9c122f1238778306815972f6d43136aa/0_52_5073_3046/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=647eedbb4e83572d3d81f3ca5fec5b12","title":"census bureau americans unemployment economy coronavirus","story":"The US Census Bureau has suspended a weekly survey that painted a bleak picture of American life during the Covid-19 pandemic, with no sign of when, or if, it will resume publishing the report.The “household pulse survey” tracked various quality-of-life measures, such as food sufficiency, internet access and mental health, and was first conducted by the Census Bureau on 23 April to “quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how people’s lives have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic”, according to the agency’s website.While data such as weekly unemployment claims released by the Department of Labor has shown how many people have lost their jobs, the survey provided a window into the effect the economic downturn is having on the lives of Americans.US households were asked whether they had enough food to eat and internet availability for education, if they had experienced depression or anxiety over the last seven days, and whether they felt they could afford next month’s rent or mortgage payments, among other questions.Over the past three months, the survey painted a desolate picture of what American households are experiencing during the pandemic – a picture that showed little sign of improvement.The Census Bureau described the survey as “experimental”. It was administered via a 20-minute series of online questions. The agency “scientifically selected” addresses to represent the whole US population. People from those addresses received emails with a link to the survey. Administering the survey cost the agency $1.2m, according to NPR.The survey was intended to last 90 days, with the last of the survey’s data from that period being released on 29 July.

A figure above 50 indicates a rise in available workers from the previous month.It comes as employers across Britain are inundated with job applications, including a restaurant in Manchester receiving more than 1,000 applicants for a receptionist role and an All Bar One in Liverpool receiving more than 500 CVs for a single bar job.Unemployment is beginning to climb as the government scales back its furlough wage subsidy scheme, while new job vacancies have collapsed during the pandemic as the British economy slides into the deepest recession for 300 years. According to the Institute for Employment Studies, as many as eight people are now claiming unemployment benefits for every job opening, compared to just 1.5 people per job in March before the pandemic struck.Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said: “There are far fewer vacancies in the market than before March, and more people looking for jobs. Recruiters will be key to helping people build confidence and find work – but the reality is that government needs to help kickstart hiring.”Despite the gloomy outlook, the REC and KPMG said there were some encouraging signs from the jobs market in July, as the rate of decline in employment slowed.James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG, said unemployment was however likely to rise further as the furlough scheme is wound down: “We are still a long way from being out of the woods, with hiring plans remaining on ice and the uncertain outlook still weighing heavily on business’ recruitment decisions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86e4bd1f089d10e2320707081ee6042ecf15da9a/0_438_7107_4264/master/7107.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ef4e9a3f6dc0cd239438449220816b6b","title":"uk staycation boom lifts sales of camping gear","story":"Is now the summer of discount tents? Retailers say airbeds, cool boxes and portable firepits in hot demand along with tentsForget draughty tents and troublesome groundsheets. A new wave of first-time campers are pimping their pitches with portable firepits and comfy airbeds as camping enjoys a revival in tandem with the UK staycation boom.Despite doom and gloom on much of the high street and the cancellation of the music festival season, retailers say shoppers have been snapping up tents, sleeping bags and cooking equipment, with many camping staples selling out.The UK’s largest retailer, Tesco, said sales of camping equipment remained strong despite people being unable to go to festivals. “Camping chairs are by far the most popular item, with sales well ahead of this time last year, while tents and airbeds have steadily increased in popularity over the past few weeks and ponchos and inflatable pillows also seeing strong growth,” a spokesman said.“As we head into peak holiday season we’ve seen demand surge for everything from rooftop boxes to camping chairs as customers ensure they can take everything they need with them for their touring and camping staycations this summer,” said David Howells, of Halfords. “We have also seen extraordinary sales of bike racks, suggesting that UK consumers plan to continue their newfound fondness of cycling whilst on holiday.”Among readers who responded to a callout by the  was 48-year-old Kathryn, whose first-time camping plans didn’t get very far. “On Saturday night, my husband and I, who are seasoned long-haul travellers, made an impulsive decision to spend the best part of £1,000 on everything our little family would need to camp,” she said. “We’re both police detectives, so we spent hours interviewing friends and family, and even had a spreadsheet.“We ordered everything from the tent to the spare pegs, the airbeds to the camping stove, the head torches to the she-wee, the sleeping bags to the rubber mallets.”The family booked a campsite for the upcoming bank holiday and awaited their order. But on Tuesday they received an email from the store saying one item was missing – the tent.“It was totally frustrating, but really funny,” she said. “Everywhere else is sold out, I think due to the demand from coronavirus. We’ve already booked the campsite but still have no tent. I’m so cross I’m going to return all 32 of the other items.”Ellen, 23, a care home administrator, recently went on her first camping trip with her boyfriend, and said they had “fallen in love” with camping.“We decided to take the plunge and go, as the idea of a foreign holiday was out of the picture and having spent most of lockdown apart we wanted to have a weekend away together,” she said.For a couple who “love an overseas adventure and a bit of luxury,” they have found an unlikely passion and have already rebooked for five weeks’ time.“We decided a three-night trip would be a good starting point,” she said. “We also managed to pick the hottest weekend of the year, which apart from it being a bit sweaty in the tent was amazing. We felt like we had all the gear and no idea but by the end we felt like pros.”Rebecca Bebbington, from the money saving website NetVoucherCodes, advises new campers to borrow or buy second-hand items rather than shelling out on new ones, and to camp out of season where possible. “Thousands of families are looking at how they can salvage summer fun without breaking the bank” she commented. “But it’s surprisingly easy for costs to spiral.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d55bbf9977aaf470660a6996289f39cfb9d3c5/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=435ead582844a66311feb289de9b6f46","title":"sanctions china politics us showdown","story":"The complex history of how China and the US once embraced each other should inform how the current showdown is tackledThe Trump administration has floated the idea of sanctioning Chinese officials and members of the Communist party of China. Before we ask whether this is a good idea, let’s ask how Sino-US relations got to this stage.The US cold war with the Soviet Union was over ideology, but today’s standoff with China is different. The Chinese state has no ideology, no religion, no moral agenda. It continues wearing socialist garb but only as a face-saving pretence. It has, in fact, become a state-capitalist dictatorship. What the world sees today is a contest between the US system of free-market capitalism and Chinese state capitalism. How should we read this chessboard?The post-Mao dictatorship in China has lived by the principle of “repress at home and be open to the world”. It has imported knowhow from abroad. There are an estimated 360,000 Chinese students currently enrolled who have come through America’s open door. Over 40 years, at least a million have returned to China and fed their new technical knowledge into the existing authoritarian structures that have built the dictatorship. It might be the most momentous personnel transfer in history. When I applied to study in the US in the 1980s, I filled out a questionnaire that asked if I had ever been a member of the Communist party. The point of the question was presumably to avoid ideological risks. But it is beyond doubt that the Chinese students coming in with me included many party members who were headed to some of the US’s finest schools, often with scholarships. Americans generally assumed that these students would feel the appeal of liberal values, which they would then take back to China. What happened more often, though, was that Chinese students were quick to see the cultural differences between the two countries, and to draw the very logical conclusion that American values are fine for America but would never work in the Chinese system.If those US hopes for the exportation of values had panned out, much of China would have been won over by now. But what has actually happened? Returnees are now leaders in much of Chinese business and industry, but anti-American expression in China is as strong today as it has been since the Mao era.Washington bears much of the responsibility for what has happened. In the years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, administrations of both parties touted the absurd theory that the best plan was to let China get rich and then watch as freedom and democracy evolved as byproducts of capitalist development.But did capitalist competition, that ravenous machine that can chew up anything, change China? The regime’s politics did not change a whit. What did change was the US, whose business leaders now approached the Chinese dictatorship with obsequious smiles. Here, after all, was an exciting new business partner: master of a realm in which there were virtually no labour rights or health and safety regulations, no frustrating delays because of squabbles between political parties, no criticism from free media, and no danger of judgment by independent courts. For European and US companies doing manufacture for export, it was a dream come true.Money rained down on parts of China, it is true. But the price was to mortgage the country’s future. Society fell into a moral swamp, devoid of humanity and difficult to escape. Meanwhile, the west made their adjustments. They stopped talking about liberal values and gave a pass to the dictatorship, in which Deng Xiaoping’s advice of “don’t confront” and Jiang Zemin’s of “lie low and make big bucks” made fast economic growth possible.European and American business thrived in the early stages of the China boom. They sat in a sedan chair carried up the mountain by their Chinese partners. And a fine journey it was – crisp air, bright sun – as they reached the mountain’s midpoint. But then the chair-carriers laid down their poles and began demanding a shift. They, too, sought the top position. The signal from the political centre in China changed from “don’t pick fights” to “go for it”. Now what could the western capitalists do? Walk back down the mountain? They hardly knew the way.Covid-19 has jolted the US into semi-awareness of the crisis it faces. The disease has become a political issue for its two major political parties to tussle over, but the real crisis is that the western system itself has been challenged. The US model appears to others as a bureaucratic jumble of competing interests that lacks long-term vision and historical aspiration, that omits ideals, that runs on short-term pragmatism, and that in the end is hostage to corporate capital.Are sanctions the way to go? A foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing recently remarked words to the effect that the US and China are so economically interlocked that they would amount to self-sanctions. The US, moreover, would be no match for China in its ability to endure suffering. And there he was correct: in dictatorships, sacrifices are not borne by the rulers. In the 1960s Mao said: “Cut us off? Go ahead – eight years, 10 years, China has everything.” A few years later Mao had nuclear weapons and was not afraid of anyone.The west needs to reconsider its systems, its political and cultural prospects, and rediscover its humanitarianism. These challenges are not only political, they are intellectual. It is time to abandon the old thinking and the vocabulary that controls it. Without new vocabulary, new thinking cannot be born. In the current struggle in Hong Kong, for example, the theory is simple and the faith is pure.

She is the third GPS-tracked whale shark to have gone missing in the last decade, he added.The Chinese fleet, numbering more than 200 vessels, is in international waters just outside a maritime border around the Galápagos Islands and also Ecuador’s coastal waters, said Norman Wray, the islands’ governor.Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the Galápagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this year’s fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years. Of the 248 vessels, 243 are flagged to China including to companies with suspected records of illegal, unreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing, according to research by C4ADS, a data analysis NGO.The fleet includes fishing boats and refrigerated container – or reefer – ships to store enormous catches.Transferring cargo between vessels is prohibited under international maritime law yet the Chinese flotilla has supply and storage ships along with longline and squid fishing boats.“There are some fleets which don’t seem to abide by any regulations,” said Wray.One captain of an Ecuadorian tuna boat saw the Chinese fishing boats up close in early July, before the end of the tuna season.“They just pull up everything!” said the captain, who asked not to be named. “We are obliged to take a biologist aboard who checks our haul if we catch a shark we have to put it back, but who controls them?”He recalled navigating through the fleet at night, constantly changing course to avoid boats, as their lights illuminated the sea to attract squid to the surface.“It was like looking at a city at night,” he said.The longline fishing boats had up to 500 lines, each with thousands of fishhooks, he estimated, and claimed that some of the vessels would turn off their automatic tracking systems to avoid detection, particularly when operating in protected areas.Chinese fishing practices first caught the attention of Ecuador in 2017 when its navy seized the Chinese reefer Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 within the Galápagos marine reserve. Inside its containers were 6,000 frozen sharks – including the endangered hammerhead shark and whale shark.“It was a slaughterhouse,” said Green, describing the images of the cargo hold. “This kind of slaughter is going on on a massive scale in international waters and nobody is witnessing it.”The seizure prompted protests outside the Chinese embassy in Quito Ecuador fined the vessel $6m and the 20 Chinese crew-members were later jailed for up to four years for illegal fishing.The arrival of the latest fleet has also stirred public outrage and a formal complaint by Ecuador as its navy is on alert for any incursion into Ecuadorian waters.The Chinese embassy in Quito said that China was a “responsible fishing nation” with a “zero-tolerance” attitude towards illegal fishing. It had confirmed with Ecuador’s navy that all the Chinese fishing vessels were operating legally “and don’t represent a threat to anyone”, it said in a statement last month.However, Roque Sevilla, a former mayor of Quito, who is leading a team in charge of designing a “protection strategy” for the islands, said the fleet practices “indiscriminate fishing – regardless of species or age – which is causing a serious deterioration of the quality of fauna that we will have in our seas”.Ecuador would establish a corridor of marine reserves with Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia to seal off important areas of marine ersity, Sevilla told the .Protecting the Cocos Ridge, an underwater mountain range which connects the Galápagos Islands to mainland Costa Rica, and the Carnegie Ridge which links the archipelago to Ecuador and continental South America, could close off more than 200,000 sq nautical miles of ocean otherwise vulnerable to industrial fishing, he said.He added Ecuador had called for a diplomatic meeting with Chile, Peru, Colombia and Panama to present a formal protest against China.“When the Galápagos’s protected area was first created it was cutting edge,” said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy, “but compared to other newer marine protected areas Galápagos is now potentially lacking in size to protect the bioersity.”Milton Castillo, the Galápagos Islands’ representative for Ecuador’s human rights ombudsman’s office, said he had asked the prosecutor’s office to inspect the cargo holds of the Chinese ships based on the legal principle of the universal and extraterritorial protection of endangered species.China’s distant-water fishing fleet is the biggest in the world, with nearly 17,000 vessels – 1,000 of which use “flags of convenience” and are registered in other countries, according to research by the Overseas Development Institute.The fleet often fishes in the territorial waters of low-income countries, the report said, having depleted fish stocks in domestic waters.Green said the “explosion of life” created by the confluence of cold and warm ocean currents around the Galápagos Islands is exactly why the Chinese armada is hovering around the archipelago’s waters.“The Galápagos marine reserve is a place of very great productivity, high biomass but also bioersity,” he said. The longline fishing technique used by the fleet catch big fish like tuna, but also sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals like sea lions and dolphins, he added.“This is not fishing any more, it is simply destroying the resources of our oceans,” Green said. “We should ask whether any nation on this planet has the right to destroy what is common ground.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6ecb866d1222b00718230d7fc77c9958db10ca/0_111_3320_1992/master/3320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad2f9db0d59b614f959502785340dcf5","title":"englands first wild beavers for 400 years allowed to live on river otter","story":"Family of reestablished colony legally sanctioned to remain in east Devon habitat The first beavers to live wild in Britain for centuries are to be allowed to remain in their new home on the River Otter in east Devon after a five-year reintroduction trial.The government gave permission on Thursday for the reestablished colony to remain in the area, the first wild breeding of beavers in 400 years and the first legally sanctioned reintroduction of an extinct native mammal to England.Up to 15 family groups of beavers are now estimated to live on the Otter, after seven years in which their future success did not always look assured. Peter Burgess, director of conservation at Devon Wildlife Trust, which has overseen the reintroduction trial, told the : “There have been some sleepless nights, and it was very stressful in the early stages. We knew the benefits, but things were hanging on a knife edge over securing the licence at the beginning.”The beavers started out as interlopers, when a family group were found to be living on the River Otter in 2013, their origins unknown. They were threatened with removal, but the Devon Wildlife Trust and community groups stepped in and tried to show the beavers were European, rather than north American, and eventually gained a licence for a five-year trial, which was extended in February to conclude this month.The dams also filter out pollutants and stop topsoil being washed away.Key to the success of the River Otter project was getting local people and farmers involved and explaining the benefits beavers can bring, as well as providing support when needed, said Burgess. There were several incidents of localised flooding of farmland, when the landowners were concerned, but by providing expert support the reintroduction team were able to resolve the problems.“If landowners know there’s someone they can pick up the phone to, it really helps,” Burgess said. “Animals are much more likely to be welcomed if that is the approach.”Beavers can grow to 20kg, but contrary to popular misconceptions, live on an exclusively vegetarian diet and do not eat fish.Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s great to see that the reintroduction of beavers in this trial has resulted in a win-win for the local area, boosting wildlife and tackling man-made problems. The trial clearly proves the benefits of nature-based solutions to dealing with flooding, water quality and resilience to climate change.“We hope to see more such welcome projects introduced by government as part of flooding, water and climate planning.”However, Phil Jarvis, chair of the environment forum at the National Farmers’ Union, warned that farmers would want to see an “exit strategy”, as well as adequate funding and a long-term management plan, before any expansion. “Beavers can have a significant local impact on the countryside and farming from creating dams that can undermine riverbanks, to impeding farmland drainage with waterlogged fields becoming unsuitable for grazing and cropping all lead to serious implications on our ability to produce food,” he said.“We must see a well-thought through exit strategy if any major issues occur.”No more releases in the wild will be allowed until the consultation is complete. Rebecca Pow, environment minister, said: “We are firmly committed to providing opportunities to reintroduce formerly native species, such as beavers, where the benefits for the environment, people and the economy are clear.“But we also understand that there are implications for landowners, and take care to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c1fd84451469d5341e34b385a3a08b1aa99635/295_202_2397_1439/master/2397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=655f5bf73c48097e87d390a8fcce947c","title":"endings beginnings review shailene woodley jamie dornan","story":"Shailene Woodley is caught between two smouldering, bearded stools in an earnest drama that lacks storytelling nousThere’s a lot going on in Drake Doremus’s flawed, serious-minded movie about relationships and personal growth – more going on, in fact, that can be successfully expressed in the running time. But this is a decently intended film from a director whose 2011 drama Like Crazy I liked very much.Daph (Shailene Woodley) is, in the words of the song, torn between two lovers. Coming off a traumatic breakup, she has quit her job and left her apartment in LA and returned to live, mortifyingly, in the pool-house belonging to her married sister Billie (Lindsay Sloane) and quite close to her demanding mother Sue (Wendie Malick). But at a party Daph meets two unfeasibly handsome guys who are best friends and totally into her: soulful intellectual Jack (Jamie Dornan) and moody bad boy Frank (Sebastian Stan).They are both bearded and gorgeous. One appeals to Daph’s cerebral side and the other to her sensuality they also look so hilariously alike that it isn’t easy to decide if this is some sort of deliberate satire or symbolism, or even some delusional nightmare. Daph doesn’t want to two-time either suitor but gets into a messy situation with both, and then realises she has been psychologically suppressing a painful experience back in LA that drove her here in the first place.This is an earnest kind of a film with a distinctive editing mannerism: heart-to-heart conversations are often portrayed in an “ambient-mood” style: single shots of people talking will suddenly jump cut to a different phase of the conversation where they are thoughtfully silent, while the audio speech track continues unbroken – as if they have suddenly taken up ventriloquism – and then cut back to them talking. It’s a bit gimmicky.The film’s problem is the LA situation. Daph concedes that this overwhelming issue will have to be confronted – and yet it is finally relegated to an afterthought, as she finds closure with all her other problem.

From the town of São José dos Campos 150km north-east, about 11 years old, he was one of maybe 300 kids of which 50 might make the cut – if they were lucky. He was also a striker, the most popular position, so when they were called he did what he had to do: he lied. A familiar cherubic smile creeps across his face and fills the screen as he remembers the moment almost two decades on.Fifty, 60, hands went up, maybe more, so his stayed down. Casemiro – the spelling changed years later when a shirt was printed wrong – didn’t much like those odds. Next, they asked who was a No 10, his other position. More hands went up. Again, his didn’t: it was still a lot of kids. When they asked for defensive midfielders, he remembers there being eight or nine. Seeing an opportunity, he raised his hand. “Me,” he said, “I am.”Turns out he was a defensive midfielder too, given time. Once he started, he didn’t stop and Casemiro may well be the world’s best now: the man his coach never rests or rotates – his apparent indestructability is a running joke – he is a title winner with a claim on being La Liga’s most important player this season. The Brazilian now travels to Manchester seeking to make progress towards his fifth European Cup. There’s something in that decision that defines him, the ability to read what is required.“Since I was a kid, I always thought and that day it came off,” he says.That’s thought. Not fought. Although there’s plenty of that. Casemiro is 6ft 1in, more than 13 stone, and plenty of footballers have felt the force of his physique. “I like to think,” he says, gently delivering his midfielder’s manifesto. “It’s not the legs, it’s the mind that’s in charge. You have to be strong, aggressive: I like challenges, contact. But you play with your head I always thought the key was thinking: being better positioned, seeing the move before it happens.”That day, he saw it. He had to. He once told Jorge Valdano that he fights for every ball as if it were “a plate of food”. Casemiro’s mother Magda, a cleaner, brought him, his sister Bianca and brother Lucas up alone. They were poor, there wasn’t always enough food and their tiny home was cramped, forcing him to spend nights with his grandparents or staying with teammates to sleep properly before playing. He recalls Nilton Moreira, who ran the club a six-mile walk away, paying fees he couldn’t: about €3. Being given boots and food. And how joining São Paulo meant finally getting fed properly. “Football,” he says, “is an escape valve, a way of achieving something in life.”“That’s especially true in Brazil where maybe we have more difficulties in education and culture,” he says, “but it’s not only there.” Casemiro recently watched Marcus Rashford’s campaign – “I really admire him, not just because he’s a great player but for how he used his position” – and links his own commitments at Save the Children Spain to a growing, welcome social conscience among footballers, insisting: “People suffering, ill, hungry, unclothed, doesn’t get seen raising awareness is the right path.Easy to say, but it has the ring of authenticity. Even among ultra-professionals he is different. “Casemiro does the work others won’t,” Sevilla’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando told El País. There’s the hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electric recovery boots, extreme abstinence, and morning sessions before training – teammate Rodrygo says Casemiro is always dragging him to the gym – together with constant videos and analysis: good decisions are not guesswork, nor are they all intuition.Rafa Benítez called him a “listener”. Julen Lopetegui describes him as “a joy to coach”, whose “secret is the desire to improve, his willingness to adapt”. It is born perhaps of an awareness that he may not be a natural virtuoso, some sense maybe that his place is at the service of others: he describes his role as “filling gaps, helping teammates”. It is manifest in his performances. When he arrived at Madrid, he didn’t look that good. He didn’t look this good, anyway.So, you’ll have spent recent days watching Manchester City then, Friday’s opponents in a tie Madrid begin 2-1 behind? Casemiro smiles, as if it’s a stupid question. “Man, since the day the league ended,” he says. “It’ll be a very, very hard game, but we go with hope. This shirt obliges you to win every game – even friendlies.”Last summer Casemiro cancelled a family trip to Disney World, instead heading to pre-season early because Madrid had lost 7-3 to Atlético in a pre-season game in New Jersey. There was duty to be done, teammates to defend. No wonder Lopetegui insists: “Centre-backs love him.” Everyone does. Zinedine Zidane calls him “fundamental”.The same Zidane who was Casemiro’s idol. “Even today I get a little nervous talking to him,” he says, smiling. “I tell him he doesn’t know what he meant for us, for me.” But he took a World Cup off Brazil? Casemiro laughs. “Yeah, I tell him that: you took ‘98 away but it didn’t change anything. Also, knowing him now, I can say he deserves it. He’s incredible: the humility, how he expresses football. He treats us with so much affection and love.”As Casemiro talks, it’s startling how quiet he is: soft, almost sweet. There’s something of that even in how he plays, a contradiction in him. Before every game he prays no one gets hurt – “yes, both teams” – but he committed more fouls than anyone last season and he doesn’t hide that being hard is part of his game. Yet there’s an angelic smile and something oddly undemonstrative. There’s no bid for attention, no hint of vindication. In fact, he retracts one line, concerned it risks sounding presumptuous. It doesn’t. A silent leader, he never seems to shout.“Well, there are moments,” he says, grinning.“It’s just my personality,” he continues. “I am very, very, very calm, even if my playing style is aggressive and everyone can see that. It’s my mum’s values: be polite, treat everyone the same. You can’t lose that, ever. You don’t need to shout to lead you can be quiet too. People might think I don’t say much but I talk to the younger players. Often, it’s better to speak alone, look someone in the eye, than before a big group. They understand better, and that’s what matters.”Another cliche collapses. And another: nor is he just a defensive midfielder, even as he seems reluctant to make a claim for more. Although Casemiro made more recoveries than anyone this season, only four players completed more passes and he scored five goals.“Maybe,” he concedes. “That’s Zizou. He’s very insistent he always, always says: ‘Case, you can do more: arrive from the second line, feed midfielders, bring the ball out cleanly.’ This year, maybe I’ve had more protagonism with the ball, but I still know my job: rob the ball, give it to my teammates. But Zizou is pesado, heavy going: always talking to me, wanting more. He says: ‘I’m not asking you to do something you can’t do I’m asking you to do something you can.’ He trusts me a lot.”Casemiro didn’t always think so. One day early in Zidane’s first spell, the midfielder knocked on the manager’s door. He hadn’t played yet and couldn’t understand it. Wasn’t Zidane supposed to be the manager that rated him, finally making him a fixture? What do I have to do, he asked: name it, I’ll do it. Relax, Zidane told him: you’ll start playing soon and when you do you won’t stop. And that’s exactly what happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b01ab0ac054376a957851283b9af57e699dfc4a0/130_100_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93aa132f63c41b7ee25376c3a988f64","title":"manchester united lask europa league last 16 second leg match report","story":"Manchester United stuttered while keeping Lask at arm’s length in a last-16 second leg that was the very definition of a non-event given their five-goal advantage from the first game. They will not care, though, as thoughts for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side turn to Monday’s quarter-final against Copenhagen, the Danish champions, in Cologne.That is a straight knockout tie, as will be the remainder of the Europa League competition United won three years ago in Stockholm. For the manager and his emerging sideit now represents a golden chance to claim their first trophy and that will be the focus when they arrive in Germany.A talking point was the substitution of Jesse Lingard after 63 minutes, a little after he equalised for United – and the player later admitted unhappiness. “I felt like I could score more today but obviously it’s the manager’s decision and I stand by that,” he said. This was put to Solskjær. “He has to stand by the manager whatever decision he makes. I’d be disappointed if he was happy,” he said.There were nine changes from the side who clinched third place in the Premier League at Leicester but only two from the 5-0 win at Lask in March. Solskjær said this was the reason for United’s disjointed play. “It is that sharpness you lack when you don’t play regularly, some haven’t played since lockdown. For me it was a good exercise, it’s job done, minutes under the belt and on to Cologne,” he said.Timothy Fosu-Mensah, whose combination with Juan Mata along the right showed flashes of promise, hit one ball straight out for a goal-kick that was United in microcosm for the opening hour or so as they sleepwalked: a Peter Michorl free-kick smacked at Scott McTominay was as much a wake-up call as some clumsy Harry Maguire defending – an air-header – moments before in his area.The captain’s aerial prowess in the opposition box also faltered when Mata dropped a rare United corner on to his head – he failed to force Alexander Schlager into action in Lask’s goal. Soporific was a fair adjective to characterise the game as the interval neared. That the Austrian side had not made United pay showed how toothless they were in attack. For a team assembled on a budget akin to a League Two side it was understandable.A Fosu-Mensah burst behind the Lask defence just before half-time was his side’s best moment, though his cross only found Schlager’s gloves. As the second half began, United had their first attempt on target though Odion Ighalo’s shot again found only Schlager.There was surprise when Lask did, at last, score. This came after Fosu-Mensah scrambled Reinhold Ranftl’s cross out for a corner. Fosu-Mensah again cleared but only to Philipp Wiesinger, who fired a 20-yard bullet past Sergio Romero.Stung, United equalised instantly. A Juan Mata pass sprung Lingard, who after taking a relative age finished with the aid of a Philipp Wiesinger boot as the No 6’s attempt to help Schlager misfired badly. Solskjær then took off Lingard and Fred for Andreas Pereira and Paul Pogba.Lask were 6-1 behind on aggregate and were left with 25 minutes chasing a United side finally on top.Tahith Chong was given the last 20 minutes by the manager, the 20-year-old replacing Brandon Williams in a first outing at left-back. As might be expected a contest that had never truly started petered out – a definition true, too, of the United career of Alexis Sánchez, who is to join Internazionale imminently on a free transfer.By the end the 18-year-old Teden Mengi had made his bow in United colours and a fellow substitute, Anthony Martial, scored his 23rd goal of the season to clinch victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/041a7365703f7e90e2d83e3e2516f1a1fb397b81/0_94_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ab21698bb00927f4055cd40fd76c22ba","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19.

Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself.

I guess another possibility for England is to bowl dry. But my sense is that they’ll go after attacking lines from the off, because if they let these two just bat, things will get very difficult indeed – even before we recall that they’re a batsman light, and respond badly to scoreboard pressure. I wonder whether England will go at the batsmen this morning. We’ve got to assume that Joe Root will start with Anderson and Broad, but after that, I’d not be surprised to see Archer send down his special brand of teeth-seekers, nor to see Stokes bully his carcass into the same. Whoever wins this session will be set up for the series, which is to say that, in my educated opinion, “the first hour is crucial”.The feeling of watching someone be good at something is an intense one, and underpins the enduring popularity of elite sport. But the feeling of watching someone be really good at something – someone making that something into an expression of their personality, an extension of their self, an elevation of their soul – underpins the enduring popularity of being alive, its own kind of morality that is somehow both calming and exhilarating, moving and amusing, mortifying and affirming.To watch Babar Azam bat is to experience all this and more, and how England handle that could well decide this Test match and this series. If they can dismiss him this morning, they will be set if they cannot, they will find themselves in major trouble. But they have plenty of scope to impose themselves. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson bowled very nicely in yesterday’s first session, while Jofra Archer looked extremely grooved and Chris Woakes extremely handsome. As such, yerman – and his pal– can expect a thorough examination over the next couple of hours. And should England fail, they will at least get to enjoy the thrill of watching Babar Batfreak do his thing.

On Wednesday, the White House said it was stepping up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from US digital networks, calling the Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok and messenger app WeChat “significant threats.”TikTok faces a deadline of 15 September to either sell its US operations to Microsoft or face an outright ban. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a US campaign called “Clean Network” would focus on five areas and include steps to prevent various Chinese apps, as well as Chinese telecoms companies, from accessing sensitive information on American citizens and businesses.In the run-up to Trump’s November re-election bid, US-China ties are at the lowest ebb in decades. Relations are strained over the global coronavirus pandemic, China’s military buildup in the South China Sea, its increasing control over Hong Kong and treatment of Uighur Muslims, as well as Beijing’s massive trade surpluses and technological rivalry.Disinformation seeded by foreign actors has emerged as a burning concern for American politicians and technologists since the 2016 presidential election, when Russian government-linked actors pumped hundreds of thousands of deceptive messages into the social media ecosystem.Many have spent the past four years trying to avoid a repeat of 2016, with companies like Google and Facebook issuing regular updates on how they’re combating online propaganda.In an interview with state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi accused Pompeo of trying to “drawn an iron curtain” and create new isions, calling actions against TikTok a “a textbook case of bullying”.“Anyone can see through clearly that the intention of the US is to protect it’s monopoly position in technology and to rob other countries of their proper right to development,” said Wang."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159804e20a5e2052ecd1e0e5d4641be21599400d/0_359_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fa88fba633ad6516ac883940fa5f7d","title":"first time uk campers tell us about your experiences","story":"Lockdown restrictions and desire to remain within country caused so-called ‘staycation’ boom as people flock to campsitesWe would like to hear from readers who have gone – or are about to go – on a camping holiday in the UK for the first time due to travel restrictions and a desire to stay within the UK.Why are you a newbie camper?

Here are some of the bestThe “five weirs” route along the River Don from Lady’s Bridge in Sheffield to Meadowhall is a lovely six-mile walk (see gpsroutes). At Meadowhall you can head back to town along the canal, or continue to Rotherham along the river (three miles). The path is mostly flat and wide, so is suitable for different levels of ability and there are public transport options (tram, train, bus) to easily return back to your starting point. Lots of options for food and drink at either end. It’s surprisingly quiet given its location, with herons, kingfishers and even otters to spot, and local nature reserves to explore just off the route. Look out for the Spider Bridge.ClareEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers\u0027 tips homepageThe port-to-port walk from the city of Lancaster to the small village of Glasson Dock is a trip through our Georgian past and industrial heritage. Starting at Skerton Bridge, England’s first flat road bridge, which influenced London and Waterloo Bridges, you soon pass Kevin Dalton Johnson’s memorial to the slave trade, Captured Africans. This is the start of a row of warehouses and a custom house, now the Maritime Museum, where sugar and cotton arrived from the west. From there it’s a six-mile walk by the river on the old railway bed to the sound of oystercatchers, sanderlings, ringed plover and curlews until you reach Glasson, with smoked fish and boats aplenty.Michael GibsonThe Tarset Bastle Trail, near Kielder Water in Northumberland, is a dreamy walk through forests and wildflower meadows, and alongside babbling Tarset Burn through a varied landscape. There are trails of eight, four or three miles starting from Greenhaugh. The terrain is easy and punctuated by romantic ruined bastles – fortified 15th-century farmhouses. Lorna WatkinsFrom historic Saltaire to charming Esholt, this walk takes in varied terrain along the banks of the Aire, and is rough underfoot in places. Parking at the (free) car park in Roberts Park, head east along the river, crossing it on busy Otley road then taking Dockfield Road. Turn left on Dock Lane and cross the footbridge to pick up the river bank trail again. From here, continue straight to the charming village of Esholt, with its 17th-century manor and the famous Woolpack pub where you can have a pint before turning back for Saltaire. The route is about 3.7 miles each way, and there are heron, pochard and kingfisher to be seen. For an easier route, follow the canal towpath until Buck Lane.Sinead GarryWalking the length of the Wey \u0026amp Godalming Navigation from the Thames to the Town Bridge in Godalming (19.8 miles) is easy to do over a few weekends and has parking available at the locks along the route. It lends itself to a series of two- to three-hour hour walks (out and back) and has some lovely countryside and interesting landmarks along the route. These include John Donne’s House (pictured), the ruins of Newark Priory and a number of second world war pillboxes. There are plenty of pubs to stop off at and lots of wildlife to see such as swans, geese, dragonflies and butterflies. Carly WiltonThe Oxford Castle Mill Stream walk (3½ miles) follows a historic but little-known stream from the Thames at Oxpens Meadow through backstreets of the city, up alongside the canal. It then loops round the bottom of the old freemen’s field, Port Meadow, to rejoin the Thames at a popular swimming spot. You can walk back to town without retracing your steps by following the Thames Path south along Fiddlers “Ait”, a Thames-region word for an island formed by sediment, broad enough only to carry the path. Joanna InnesWalking along the River Tweed from Abbotsford (home of Sir Walter Scott) is a joy. A tranquil eight-mile stroll takes in a scenic circular route past the gorgeous market town of Melrose, where you can meander through the abbey with an ice-cream. You walk along railway line paths and tracks that Scott himself established. You get to take in the majesty of the Tweed where salmon and trout make ripples on the golden water. This is easy terrain to navigate and is a good day out with kids and older people alike.Ciaran EarleStart at Staines Bridge, and on the Egham bank walk along the towpath to Runnymede: you’ll go under the M25 and shortly after pass Bell Weir Lock. When you reach Runnymede Pleasure Gardens, head for the Kennedy Memorial and continue up Coopers Hill (visit the RAF Memorial if you’ve time). Find your way to Bishopsgate Road and enter Windsor Great Park. Go through the gates to the Deer Park and then down the Royal Mile to Windsor and return to Staines by train. It’s about eight miles: we used to do this walk often when we lived down south. Plenty of opportunity for refreshment stops.David NewsteadCardiff is a mercifully compact city with a green heart, through which runs the river Taff. You can pick up the Taff Trail in Cardiff at Westgate Street Bridge and embark on a leisurely, flat and accessible six-mile walk to Castell Coch and on the way stop for a coffee and cake in Sophia Gardens, the cricket ground. The trail is well signposted and suitable for wheelchairs. You will be amazed how within five minutes of walking you will never believe you were in a city centre: herons, swans, dragonflies and the splendid trees and sculptures of Bute park arboretum will keep you company until you reach the weir at Llandaff and onwards to the “red castle”.Gareth HopkinsThis is a stunning six-mile circular walk along the banks of the Nar, starting from Castle Acre village (free parking around the Bailey Gate and green). Set off heading away from the village, with the church on your left, and head down towards the priory (signposted) keeping the remains of the flintstone wall on your left. The tracks after this are narrow at times and not suitable for prams, thought there are some boardwalks. There are quite a few narrow plank bridges to cross. The chalk stream is beautifully clear and nice for a little dip if you want to. It is always very quiet – you rarely see more than a handful of people the whole walk, so it’s particularly good for social distancing. The full circle takes around two hours.

They booked a campsite in the Forest of Dean for two nights, and ordered “a load of random camping equipment”.“We hadn’t had much time to prepare because work and been so busy,” Chandler said. “Once we pulled all the stuff out of the garage, I thought, this is never ever going to fit. We got a puppy just before lockdown, so he was on my knee. The wine was under my feet, the kids were sat on all the bedding and pillows, and the back of the car was full.”Chandler admitted she had been “dreading” the trip, as rain was forecast and she was hesitant about having to set up the tent. However, the family had an “amazing” time.“Putting the tent up was far easier that we thought, although it didn’t take long for the dog to chew through one of the guy ropes,” she said. “Seeing the kids having the time of their lives was amazing, they had so much freedom, and we had time to read books, catch up on the news, and chill out.”The family have already booked two further trips. “I can’t see me giving up the villa just yet, but I can see us going camping for shorter breaks to get some time out,” Chandler said. “It forces you to unwind, and that’s really great.”Two weeks ago, John, 27, and a group of school friends headed for the Lake District for a camping trip to enjoy a ‘Covid safe’ holiday together.“I was very apprehensive at first, but this is the only way I could see them,” he said. “This seemed like the safest way to maintain a distance but still share in the warmth of each other’s company.”John, who lives in Portsmouth, had slept in tents during musical festivals, but had never been on a camping trip before, and was in for a rude awakening.“We went on a hike up a nearby hill, and the path was steep and treacherous. I’ve been on walks before, and I’m not out of shape, but this was a different beast. Part way up, the conditions got fairly bad, and we had the choice to keep going or go back down the horrible path. We carried on and didn’t get an awful lot better,” John said.“Apparently it wasn’t even a very big hill, one of the smallest in the Lake District,” he added.When they returned, John’s tent had been soaked by a nearby river and the surrounding area became a bog.“My friend saw the tent first and started crying with laughter. Me and my girlfriend were both drenched and miserable. We’d been holding on to the idea of a warm tent. We got in and salvaged what we could, mopped up and had to sleep in a damp tent. It was either that or drive six hours home into the night, so we thought we might as well just sleep in the puddle,” he said.Despite this, John said he would go camping again.“It’s not the sort of fun we’re used to in our normal lives, but it is good fun,” he said. “It’s cheaper than a usual holiday, and the Lake District is gorgeous, so really it’s not so bad.”In the Midlands, 48-year-old Kathryn’s camping plans didn’t progress very far.“On Saturday night, my husband and I, who are seasoned long haul travellers, made a rather impulsive decision to spend the best part of £1,000 on everything our little family would need to camp,” she said. “We’re both police detectives, so we did loads of research. We spent hours interviewing friends and family, and even had a spreadsheet.“Debit card at the ready, we ordered everything from the tent to the spare pegs, the airbeds to the camping stove, the head torches to the she-wee, the sleeping bags to the rubber mallets.”The family booked a campsite for the upcoming bank holiday and awaited their order. On Tuesday, they received an email from the store they had purchased the items from, saying that just one item was missing – the tent.“It was totally frustrating, but really funny,” she said. “Everywhere else is sold out, I think due to the demand from coronavirus. We’ve already booked the campsite but still have no tent. I’m so cross I’m going to return all 32 of the other items.”Ellen, 23, who works as an administrator at a care home recently went on her first camping trip with her boyfriend, and said the pair have “fallen in love” with camping.“We decided to take the plunge and go, as the idea of a foreign holiday was out of the picture and having spent most of lockdown apart we wanted to have a weekend away together,” she said.For a couple who “love an overseas adventure and a bit of luxury,” they have found an unlikely passion, and already rebooked for five weeks’ time.“We decided a three-night trip would be a good starting point,” she said. “We also managed to pick the hottest weekend of the year, which apart from it being a bit sweaty in the tent was amazing. We kind of felt like we had all the gear and no idea but off we went. By the end we felt like pros.”“We have absolutely fallen in love with camping, so much so we have decided to go again and are both so excited,” she added.Richard Kenchington recently took his first camping trip with his pregnant wife and young child after “taking the plunge” and buying a camper van in November, but said it wasn’t quite the enchanting ‘van lifestyle’ he had bought into.“It was one of those things we just decided. We were attracted by the lifestyle but we’d never tried it before, and jumped in feet first,” he said. “In theory it’s cheaper than foreign holidays, which currently are almost impossible.”During his trip in the Isle of Wight, Kenchington and his family experienced a gas leak in the camper van, and a tent collapse, and ongoing battles to encourage their four-year-old to following physical distancing.“The neighbours, in their much more expensive camper van, had to fix our tent when it collapsed. We came back and thought, we didn’t leave it like that, and the people next door told us they rescued it. The water bottle had gone everywhere and it was all wet,” he said. “You don’t expect that to happen, and have to tidy it all up with a four- year-old who wants to play. It did feel like one thing after another.”Despite this, Kenchington is determined to try again.“I don’t know if it’s because we enjoyed it, or because we bought the camper van and we have to use it. But we’re going to try again at the end of the month,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4705316d060d0755a93c55acfc739c5ff3055d1/0_37_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=74e49e0247f62239bd08ccc75697f068","title":"beirut explosion lebanon tell us how you are affected","story":"If you have been affected by the events in Beirut you can share your experiences directly with our journalistsHospitals in the Lebanese capital of Beirut are buckling under the weight of casualties following an explosion in the city on Tuesday which killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000.More than 100 people remain missing, and many are feared to have been trapped under the rubble.

As recently as six months ago, officials inspecting the consignment warned that if it was not moved it would “blow up all of Beirut”.The revelation that government negligence may have played a role in the worst explosion in Beirut’s history fuelled new anger towards Lebanon’s political class among a population already seething at an ongoing financial crisis that has sunk half the country into poverty. Demonstrators in downtown Beirut attacked the convoy of former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri and brawled with his bodyguards in the most overt display of wider anger that is building against Lebanese politicians in the wake of the disaster.From one shattered balcony, a thin noose was hung along with a sign. “Whose heads will be hung?” it read. “Hang up the nooses” also trended across Lebanese social media in an indication of the fury that followed the initial shock and grief.The government said on Wednesday evening it was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how the highly explosive materials came to be stored less than 100 metres from a residential neighbourhoods. The national cabinet also declared a two-week state of emergency, effectively giving the military full powers in the capital.The death toll climbed to more than 135 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross with another 5,000 wounded. Up to 300,000 people had suffered damage to their homes, leaving some uninhabitable, Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, said. Dozens of people are still missing, feared buried under rubble.Residents across the city were sweeping shattered glass and other debris from their homes on Wednesday morning as blame for the tragedy started to be apportioned on social media and Lebanese TV channels.The Lebanese prime minister on Tuesday night had blamed the explosion on 2,750-tonne store of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in bombs and fertilisers, that had been stored at the port. Media reports from 2014 claimed a Russian-owned vessel carrying that load was impounded at Beirut’s port that year, after making an emergency stop in the city and being denied permission to leave by customs authorities because it was deemed unseaworthy.The former captain of the vessel, the Rhosus, alleged in an interview with Russian journalists six years ago that the owner of the ship, reported as Igor Grechushkin, had abandoned it along with the crew, who were being “held hostage” by customs authorities. “The owner has abandoned the ship. The cargo is ammonium nitrate. It is an explosive substance. And we’ve been abandoned. We’ve been living for 10 months on a powder keg.” has not been able to verify the claims Grechushkin was the ship’s owner and has attempted to contact him for comment.In another letter published by a journalist in touch with the crew, the ship was described as “a floating bomb and the crew is a hostage aboard this bomb.”The mostly Ukrainian crew were held onboard the ship for nearly a year before they were released, their lawyers said in a 2015 note, and the ammonium nitrate was confiscated and held at the port in a warehouse.In an interview with Radio Free Europe on Wednesday, the ship’s captain denied there were problems with the ship and said it was detained for failing to pay port fees. The International Transport Workers Federation, which sought back wages and repatriation for the crew, confirmed that the ship was being held in part because it owed the port $100,000 in unpaid bills. In an interview with Radio Free Europe on Wednesday, the ship’s captain at the time, Boris Prokoshev, said he had been in direct contact with Grechushkin, whom he called the ship’s owner.Badri Daher, the director-general of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI on Wednesday morning that in the years that folllowed, his agency had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger. “We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen,” he said. “We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.”The news agency Reuters quoted an anonymous source close to a port employee saying a team had inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago and warned that if it was not moved it would “blow up all of Beirut”. Another source said several committees and judges had been warned about the chemicals was “nothing was done” to dispose of it.Still unclear was what set off the ammonium nitrate, which requires extreme heat to ignite. Abboud said on Tuesday that the Beirut municipality had dispatched firefighters to the site in response to reports of a blaze, and that they were missing after the explosion – suggesting the fire had burned long enough for the crew to arrive at the scene.Several pieces of footage from the moments preceding the blast also showed thick grey smoke billowing from port, along with a series of small explosions that gave off red fumes, and then a massive blast involving more than 1,300-times the amount of ammonium nitrate used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Reuters quoted an anonymous source on Wednesday claiming the fire had started at a warehouse number nine, before spreading to warehouse 12 where the ammonium nitrate was stored. The source of the initial fire is not publicly known.Aerial and drone photographs showed a deep crater of blasted land where warehouse 12 stood, next to a row of destroyed grain silos and the surrounding area almost entirely razed.The Lebanese economy minister, Raoul Nehme, said damage to the silos had left the country with less than a month’s grain reserves, but claimed there was no risk of food shortage. “There is no bread or flour crisis,” he said. “We have enough inventory and boats on their way to cover the needs of Lebanon on the long term.”Abboud said damage from the blast extended over half of Beirut, with the cost of damage likely above $3bn.On Wednesday evening, the UK Foreign Office announced a British aid package for Lebanon, including up to £5m in emergency humanitarian funding, as well as deploying search and rescue experts, tailored medical help, strategic air transport assistance, and engineering and communications support.Much of East Beirut is no longer inhabitable, something that the few residents and shopkeepers picking through their wrecked businesses tacitly acknowledge. “I don’t know how we’re going to get through this,” said Issam Nassir, the manager of a tyre shop that stood incongruously amid what used to be a travel agent, a pizza parlour, and an upmarket bar – all destroyed. “Do you really think Hiroshima could have been worse than this?”The sound of mountains of glass being swept from balconies and cascading onto roads was a soundtrack to the day. Tired emergency workers trudged through the streets, some holding sledgehammers, others carrying water. A carpark in the Gemmayze district had been turned into a triage centre. Orange plastic stretchers, slick with blood were lined up from one side to the other.After becoming a byword for destruction and chaos in the 1980s, Beirut rebounded from its 15-year civil war to regain a reputation as a hard-partying playground for the wealthy and theatre for the Middle East’s political intrigues.Bullet holes still marked many buildings, electricity remained intermittent and the isions of the civil war went unreconciled, but Lebanon defied its doomsayers for three decades, attracting investment from across the region and millions of dollars in remittances from its diaspora that papered over the cracks in its institutions and infrastructure.That run appears to have ended in 2020, with its national accounts revealed to be stuffed with loans it cannot repay, and the bureaucratic inertia and negligence that dogs the lives of many Lebanese accused of contributing to one of the worst disasters in the country’s modern history.“What happened yesterday is the result of the incompetence of the so-called responsible people,” wrote Stéphane Bazan, a Lebanese consultant, in a widely shared Facebook post on Wednesday.“How many disasters are still waiting for? We run out of electricity, water is poisoned, food is suspicious, weapons are everywhere. They stole our money, our children’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89dcce825da98adc77f56607eab0a60132038626/0_8_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8680d9e05d3ee948dddaf4511b63973d","title":"meet david born in france raised in belgium facing removal to the drc","story":"He grew up in Brussels and dreams of a career in fashion, but hardline laws make him an asylum seeker in his own countryWhen David (not his real name) walked into the headquarters of the Belgian immigration department to apply for asylum, he looked at the other people in the queue and thought: “They don’t speak French, they had to flee their country, they have good reason for asking for protection. I’m going to be laughed at.” The officials at the reception desk did not laugh, but they did give him “a weird look”, David says. “When they heard my accent and saw my dyed blond hair, they seemed to think: ‘What are you doing here?’”David recounts that day last year with a flawless Bruxellois accent. Born on the outskirts of Paris to parents of Congolese descent, he arrived in Belgium when still a toddler. We meet close to where he lives, in Brussels’ university district. His outfit – black ripped skinny jeans, black polo shirt and two white wireless earbuds – is carefully chosen: David, now 22, is set on a career in fashion.In the same month he applied for asylum, January 2019, Belgium received 2,765 applications, mainly from Palestinians, Afghans and Syrians. Why does David, who grew up in Brussels and has never set foot outside the EU, have to seek international protection in what he feels is his home country? Because he is at serious risk of being deported to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country his parents left when they were children, following their own refugee parents.David’s mother was 17 when he was born. She soon separated from David’s father, who did not recognise David as his son. A few years later she left France for Brussels. The young, single mother entrusted her son to his paternal grandmother. “My mother wanted to live her life, my father was in jail by then,” David says. “But I had a happy childhood. I had a lot of cousins, uncles and aunts, I had my friends in school. I didn’t know anything about my immigration issues.”Estimates suggest between 100,000 and 150,000 undocumented people live in Belgium. No one seems to know how many of them are children, growing up with limited rights. “They have the right to education,” says Melanie Zonderman from the Platform for Minors in Exile, a network for migrant children’s rights, “and, like undocumented adults, the right to emergency medical services.” That is it.In Belgium, as in other European countries, the paths to legal status are confusing and difficult to navigate, let alone for a child. They can apply for a humanitarian permit to stay in Belgium under article 9bis of the Belgian aliens act, but whether this is granted or not depends on opaque criteria, which the Belgian immigration department does not make public. The process can take years, costs €358 (£325) for adults (it is free for children), and in the meantime children are at risk of deportation.David’s situation was complex. His best option seemed to be “family reunification” with a parent living legally in the country. But his mother, who suffered from mental illness and addiction, had not kept up her residence permit. His father, who was released from prison when David was about 10 years old, still had not recognised him as his son.With David’s 18th birthday approaching, his father finally agreed to a DNA paternity test. When he was 16, David received a five-year permit based on “reunification” with his father. Two years later, he was told there had been a mistake: as the child of a refugee, not a Belgian citizen, he was only eligible for a renewable one-year permit, which would become permanent after five years. David felt the blow, but told himself he just had to hold on for a few more years.Then he did something that blew it all: he came out. “When my father got out of prison, he soon realised I was not the son he would have wanted,” David said. “I have always been effeminate. He started making comments: ‘Why is he like this, why does he dance like a girl?’ And I thought: ‘I don’t even know you, and you want to change me … I don’t like this.’” During his adolescence David felt as if he had a split personality: “At school I was extrovert, sociable and good-humoured, while at home I was silent, almost embittered.”One day in January 2018, “I was fighting over the phone with my dad, and I just threw it in his face: ‘By the way, I’m gay!’ He hung up. I started packing my things.” In the following months, David felt relieved. “I started wearing makeup at school,” he says. But then October came, and he had to renew his residence permit. Among the criteria was that David’s father lived with his son and had a stable income. “When the official at the city council asked me for my father’s payslip, I realised my situation,” he says. “I told him I wasn’t even talking to my father.” David became undocumented, again.He tried applying for a permit under article 9bis, but his pro bono lawyer turned out to be not so pro bono: “He kept asking me for money.” The lack of transparent criteria also made this route risky. He went to France, his country of birth, to see if he could get papers there, but he was not eligible under French nationality laws.Until recently, a lot of families with children were rejected for asylum, says Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist from the Progress Lawyers Network. “The minors weren’t even mentioned in these decisions. They were literally treated like part of their parents’ luggage.” So lawyers started filing separate asylum requests for the children, arguing that reintegrating in countries they barely knew, after spending their childhood or adolescence in Belgium, would not only be impossible but would expose them to serious risks.On Benkhelifa’s advice, David decided to apply for asylum, based on the persecution he would face in the DRC because of his sexuality. Robin Bronlet, a colleague of Benkhelifa’s, is optimistic about David’s case. But he points out the absurdity of the rule by which children inherit the nationality of their parents. “As immigration lawyers, we must identify the risks David would be facing in case of ‘return’ to his ‘country of origin’, meaning the DRC,” he says, “even though David was born in Europe and never set foot in Africa.”Today, undocumented children are scattered all over Belgium. Some of them make the news when they suddenly disappear from school, are detained and sometimes deported. But most, like David, keep their worries to themselves and blend in with their classmates, hoping for some miraculous solution.None of David’s closest friends from school know he has lost his residence permit and has applied for asylum. “If I told them, they would worry, and it would be too stressful,” he says, “and I don’t want to be pitied.” Since leaving his grandmother’s house, David has moved around a lot. He stayed with friends and even spent a few nights in a hotel when had nowhere else to go. In September 2019, he moved into a flat with three other gay asylum seekers through Le Refuge, an organisation supporting isolated LGBTQI+ youth.At the end of 2019, David’s mother was arrested after an identity check and taken to Belgium’s only immigration detention centre for women, in Holsbeek. While he remains estranged from his father and grandmother, his mother has accepted his sexuality. She spent six months in detention before the coronavirus outbreak forced Belgian authorities to release many immigration detainees. David visited her several times. “To me, it was an extension of what I had gone through since entering the asylum system,” he says. “The human side is totally lacking. All they see in you is a sans-papiers.”David is eagerly awaiting his interview with asylum authorities. “I’m really sick of waiting. I feel stuck,” he says. And yet he is making plans for his future. He wants to start a YouTube channel offering advice on makeup, fashion, wigs and how to “boost the confidence of LGBT young people”. He wants to find a job to save money and enrol in fashion school. “Will the asylum authorities believe me?” he wonders. “I will tell them my truth. If it’s not enough, too bad. If it’s enough, so much the better. I just want to get it over with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fc37400c8667e9a3c03831a985b361b14e4c47/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ecb660885feb947d0c89f963181b219","title":"visual guide how explosion caused mass casualties and devastation across beirut","story":"Explosion in port of Beirut has killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000 with damage extending over half the cityby  Ashley Kirk,  Chris Watson,  Paul Torpey and  Cath LevettAt least 135 people have been killed, 5,000 injured and dozens of buildings damaged after a massive explosion ripped through Beirut’s port and surrounding area.Lebanon is reeling from the extensive damage caused by the explosion on Tuesday evening, with the port area flattened and buildings further into the city’s residential neighbourhoods damaged. Efforts to treat the injured have been hampered by the fact that hospitals are among the damaged buildings.The blast was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles (193 km) away.Lebanon president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. After an initial blast and fire in the port, it is thought that this was the cause of a second blast, with a massive fireball and white cloud sending a shockwave across the city.Shop and apartment windows were blown out as far away as two miles (3.2 km) from the port, littering the streets with broken glass and causing hundreds of injuries.Video footage shows buildings next to the port area taking heavy damage as the shockwave spread through the city.Beirut’s governor has said that the blast damage extends to over half of the city, and that up to 300,000 people have been left homeless.Rescue teams are searching through debris in several neighbourhoods for missing people, while hospitals are overwhelmed with dealing with thousands of injured.Damage has been confirmed as far away as Beirut airport, six miles (9.5 km) from the blast site. A similar explosion in central London would see damage extend to the areas of Wood Green, Stratford and Forest Hill while the Bronx would have been affected if this happened in central Manhattan.The impact of the explosion can be gauged from aerial images showing the port before and after the blast. A chunk is missing from the quay where the explosion took place and the immediate surrounding area appears almost entirely razed.A closer view taken from a drone shows the smouldering remains of obliterated buildings, with water filling a crater where the quayside was destroyed.The destructive range of the explosion can seen in damage to an entertainment venue more than 1km across the harbour from the blast site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056401d16c375ff241ee46ce816a0f3b2d2eaea2/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788e8d2e4a677a6779d056b5ae80a29c","title":"last of the zoroastrians parsis mumbai india ancient religion","story":"A funeral, a family, and a journey into a disappearing religion. By  Shaun Walker My grandfather had never been a tall man, and now he looked absurdly small, no bigger than a child. Swaddled in off-white sheets like a newborn, with just his head and the soles of his feet visible, his eyes were open and mouth disconcertingly agape, as if in surprise. His corpse was slightly raised from the floor, lain atop a rickety wooden stretcher. Beside the body, three priests in white robes intoned in Avestan, the long-dead language of the Zoroastrian scriptures, as a small fire burned in a silver urn in front of them.It was the height of Mumbai’s monsoon season, and the air in the prayer pavilion was heavy with moisture. The occasional cloudburst outside provided no respite from heat or humidity, and the priests cooled themselves with handheld fans that resembled ping-pong bats as they repeated their sonorous chants. The funeral was the first time I had heard Zoroastrian prayers spoken out loud, though I remembered my grandfather over the years murmuring them under his breath multiple times a day, velvet cap on his head and prayer book in his hand. Besides my mother and me, the small group in attendance was mainly made up of frail friends and distant relatives, almost all of them Parsis, as the Zoroastrians of India are known.The cremation came later the same afternoon, the heat from the chrome furnace adding to the stickiness. The body was reduced in a matter of minutes to a kilogram of ashes, which were handed to us the next morning in a knotted sack the size of a coconut. Prayers continued the next day, the extended ceremony providing a map for slowly working through the grief.In the days after the funeral, it struck me with some sadness that my grandfather, who had spent almost a century devoted to the Zoroastrian faith, would be the final Parsi in his family line. Growing up in Britain, I’d read a bit about the history of Zoroastrianism, but only knew the basics: it was one of the oldest religions, based on the teachings of the prophet Zarathustra, who lived thousands of years ago, though nobody knew exactly where or when (Iran, central Asia, perhaps what is now southern Russia and about 1500 BC, give or take a few centuries). The faith he preached, of an epic battle between a powerful deity and an evil spirit, in which his followers should do everything in thoughts, words and deeds to aid the side of light, was passed down orally for centuries before it was committed to parchment. It became the dominant religion of Persia for more than a millennium, until the advent of Islam in the seventh century. Some Zoroastrians who refused to convert fled, and ended up in Gujarat in western India, where they became known as Parsis after their Persian origins. They built new temples to house their sacred fires, which were tended to by priests and could never be extinguished.The Parsis promised their Hindu hosts they would not proselytise, and over the centuries this morphed into a dogmatic aversion to conversion. The rigorous tribalism kept the small community alive and distinct for more than a millennium, but in today’s world, the same intransigence is killing it off. “You’ve seen four weddings and a funeral – well, for Parsis, it’s four funerals and a wedding,” says Jehangir Patel, who has edited the community’s monthly magazine, Parsiana, for almost 50 years. When he finally retires, he fears the magazine will simply close, as more of its readers are dying off each year. India’s Parsi population shrank from 114,000 in 1941 to 57,000 at the last census in 2011. Projections suggest that by the end of the century, there will be just 9,000 left.My grandfather, Pestonjee Pader, was a gentle man with a raucous, childish sense of humour, but not far beneath the surface lurked a sense of tragedy. He liked to tell stories, but most of them ended in one of two ways: “… and then, unfortunately, we had to leave”, or “… and then, tragically, they passed away too soon”. Born into a Parsi family in 1922, he grew up in the Gulf city of Aden, a thriving port then under British rule, which attracted many Parsi traders. After his father died in the late 30s, my grandfather took over the family business, supplying food and other provisions to the ships that docked in Aden on their way between Europe and Asia. He also ran the Long Bar, where he watered thirsty soldiers from the British garrison. He negotiated a concession from Carlsberg, importing beer from Denmark and eventually making a handsome profit. By the mid-60s, he was on the verge of setting up an ice-cream factory, a sure money-maker in the punishing Gulf heat. But the plans fell through when revolution came to southern Yemen in 1967, driving out the British and, by extension, the Parsis, too. My grandparents escaped to Bombay, leaving all but a few suitcases of possessions behind.For my grandfather, the real tragedies were still to come: between 1976 and 1983, he lost his wife and both his sons, leaving my mother as his only surviving child. When we flew out to visit him during school holidays in the 90s, his once-grand apartment on Mumbai’s Malabar Hill felt as if it were occupied by ghosts: a table laid with Carlsberg glasses and coasters, carefully preserved from decades earlier photographs of the deceased on the sideboards. He padded around the too-big apartment, saying Zoroastrian prayers of remembrance for the dead several hours each day, and regularly taking the bus to the fire temple for prayers. In the evenings, he went out for dinner with his mostly Parsi friends, until they, too, started dying off. For as long as I can remember, he would say matter of factly that he was ready to die, but he kept on going, remaining healthy into his late 80s. It was only right at the end, when dementia hit, that he became weak and confused. In summer 2017, the news came that he had finally passed away, shortly after turning 95.My grandfather stuck to his Zoroastrian faith doggedly, whatever obstacles life tossed into his path, but my mother was ejected from the Parsi fold, officially at least, when she married out. She came to London when she was 17, to go to university and then train as an English teacher. She slipped away from a planned marriage to a good Parsi boy, and later married my dad, another teacher from Southampton. Her parents, unlike many other relatives, quickly came to accept the marriage, but the strict community rules meant she was no longer a Parsi. Partly, she accepted this, and partly, she just ignored it. “No religious bigot was going to define who I was,” she told me, and she continued to feel deeply attached to the cultural aspects of being Parsi.Although my family often visited India when I was growing up, my sister and I never learned to speak Gujarati, and there was no suggestion among our Parsi relatives that we should partake in Zoroastrian rituals and ceremonies to feel a sense of belonging to the community, or even that we would be allowed to if we wanted. This wasn’t something I fretted about. I liked the idea of a secret, Zoroastrian side of my identity, but in my studies and then my professional life, I gravitated towards Russia, not India or Zoroastrianism. On visits to Mumbai I felt like much more of an outsider than I did when walking the streets of Moscow, where I made my home as a foreign correspondent.But the funeral stirred in me a new interest in the 3,500-year-old Zoroastrian religion and today’s tiny Parsi community. As the religion’s followers declined, why were Parsis so dogmatic about keeping their doors closed to mixed-heritage children, let alone accepting outside converts? And did this mean that the whole Parsi community was heading for the same fate as my grandfather: a drawn-out but sadly inevitable disappearance?Nearly three years later I found a way to seek some answers: a Return to Roots trip, which took a small group of young Parsis to India for an exploration of their history and culture. The idea was loosely modelled on Birthright Israel, which brings young Jews to the Holy Land, though our version was on a much smaller scale and free of attendant geopolitics.I landed in Mumbai one night in early March, and the next morning the group met for orientation, each of us saying a few words about ourselves and what we hoped for from the next two weeks. Five of the 15 participants were from the dwindling Parsi community of Karachi most of the others were children of Parsi parents who had moved to North America. They were ided between those who had strong connections to the religion and those who had lost touch and wanted to re-engage with it. There was one American-Iranian, whose family came from the small community of Zoroastrians who remained behind in Iran and live there to this day. And then there was me, the only halfie.Arzan Sam Wadia, the Mumbai-born, New York-based architect who runs Return to Roots, had told me that the tour is emphatically not meant to function as a Parsi dating service, but he added immediately that new couples had indeed formed on previous tours, which was a pleasing side-effect. Certainly, on the first morning there was a tangible feeling of excitement at the presence of so many fellow members of that endangered species, the young Parsi. One of the volunteers accompanying us, Sheherazad, a 25-year-old Zoroastrian priest, told us he would be on hand to help with logistics and answer any spiritual questions, for those who had forgotten the prayers and rituals they learned as children (and for me, who never knew them in the first place). With a crop of bleached blond hair and a mischievous smile, he was far from the humourless, conservative figure I expected of a priest. He told us to call him Sherry.After the introductions, we headed to the Towers of Silence, a sprawling expanse of forested land in the heart of downtown Mumbai that takes its name from the stone structures inside the grounds, where the bodies of Zoroastrians are consigned after death. The whole area is closed to the public, and I felt a rush of excitement through my jetlag as our bus passed through the guarded gates, adorned with signs warning off non-Parsis. Herodotus, in the fifth century BC, wrote of Persians exposing their dead to vultures, and 2,500 years later the tradition persists: Parsi corpses are laid out inside the stone towers, also known as dakhmas (in fact, they are shaped more like amphitheatres than towers). The first dakhma was built here in 1670, when big cats roamed what was then a wild forest. Today, the grounds are populated with butterflies, parrots and peacocks, and entering the serene space from the urban cacophony outside is pleasingly jarring.Our guide for the Mumbai leg of the tour was Khojeste Mistree, the intellectual kingpin of orthodox Parsis. Unfailingly polite yet ruthlessly dogmatic, Mistree trained as a chartered accountant before taking up Zoroastrian studies in Britain in the 60s, and later arrived back in India armed with historical knowledge to aid the conservative Parsis who wanted to keep the faith closed.As we walked through the greenery towards one of the two dakhmas currently in use, Mistree exalted the Parsi method of consigning the dead. “It is the best and most ecologically sound way to dispose of a corpse,” he said, explaining that it prevented the earth being polluted with the evil spirits present in a dead body. Mistree told us that each dakhma could hold more than 250 bodies, laid out on slats inside the round stone structures. When the bodies have fully decomposed, corpsebearers push the skeletons into a hole in the middle, though the high walls meant none of this was visible to us.“You’re standing here by this dakhma, and what can you smell?” asked Mistree in his distinctive voice, which drops just a hint of Bombay twang into the soaring cadences of an Oxford don. “That’s right. Nothing. Whatever scurrilous gossip you read in the papers about rotting corpses and so on, it’s nonsense.”As recently as the 80s, hungry vultures had swooped into the dakhmas and picked Parsi corpses clean in a matter of days. Then, in the space of a decade, the birds died out, mainly owing to the use of diclofenac, a drug fed to livestock that poisoned vultures when they fed on the carcasses. Bodies inside the dakhmas were instead left to decompose naturally, which could take several months. On certain days, people living nearby could catch a putrid whiff of decaying human flesh from their windows. In 2006, someone sneaked a camera inside one of the dakhmas and leaked photographs of the gruesome sight online. Even the staunchest advocates of dakhma consignment were horrified, and began thinking up possible solutions. A programme to breed new vultures came to nothing. There was brief excitement at the creation of a specially designed mixture of herbs and chemicals, stuffed into the orifices of the dead, but it was so effective that the dakhma floors became covered in a layer of human slurry, on which the corpsebearers kept slipping, making their unenviable job still more difficult.“I’m sorry to say,” said Mistree, in a tone that was notably unapologetic, “that those Parsis who opt for cremation will go to hell.” Later, he clarified that Parsis who lived abroad could choose alternative methods, though never cremation, as it sullied fire with the evil spirits present in a dead body. But for those who lived in Mumbai, like my grandfather, there was no excuse. In Mistree’s severe reading of Zoroastrianism, a man who had spent most of his 95 years on Earth steeped in prayer, and abiding by the exhortation to good thoughts, words and deeds, had been despatched to hell.The next day, we boarded an open-top double-decker bus for a tour of the religious sites and cultural monuments of Parsi Mumbai, and a lesson about the Parsi influence on India’s history. Mahatma Gandhi’s intellectual mentors? Parsis. Biggest philanthropists of 19th-century India? Parsis. The first underground cinema carpark in India? Built by a Parsi. “It is quite mind-blowing how so few people have given so much,” said Mistree over a microphone, as our bus weaved through the jostle of the streets, above the honking cars and the chink-chink of the machines making juice from sugar cane. We lunched at the Ripon Club, a Parsi dining venue opened in 1884, amid grand portraits and busts of illustrious past members and tables seating a few geriatric current ones.The following morning, in a lecture at Mistree’s apartment, he laid out the basic tenets of Zoroastrianism. I was impressed with its answer to the agnostic’s most vexing question: why, if there is an almighty God, is there so much suffering on earth? The Zoroastrian God, Ahura Mazda, is locked in a permanent battle with Ahriman, an evil spirit. Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent, meaning that famine, disease, killings and other evils are not the work of a jealous and vengeful God, but are instead the temporary triumph of Ahriman. Early Zoroastrianism had a great influence on other major religions, and some scholars believe that Jewish eschatology grew out of Zoroastrian thinking. The three wise men of the nativity story are thought to have been Zoroastrian priests.Mistree moved on to the holy fires, which are central to Zoroastrian worship. Creating the “highest grade” of fire requires the merging of 16 separate fires, he told us, including fire from a lightning strike and fire from the house of a king. The resultant super-fire takes 14,000 hours of prayer to consecrate, and can subsequently only be fed with sandalwood. “I was in England when Coventry cathedral was consecrated and the ceremony was only six to eight hours,” he said, pausing for us to savour the comparison. Mistree also spoke of the importance of the sudreh and kusti, an undershirt and belt tied ceremonially while praying, which had to be worn for any visit to a temple. Mistree insisted that to be a “real” Zoroastrian, a person had to wear their sudreh and kusti every day. Because I hadn’t had a navjote – the Zoroastrian coming of age ceremony – I was not eligible to wear them, and thus not permitted to enter any fire temples. (Since a still-contested reform a century ago, children of mixed marriages in which the father is the Parsi can have a navjote and join the fold, but if the mother marries out, it’s game over.)Beneath the zealous adherence to ritual was a basic theology that seemed both simple and admirable. Zoroastrianism does not prize concepts such as guilt, martyrdom or asceticism. There is, instead, an obligation to work hard, make money, enjoy the proceeds and give generously. “Fasting is a sin. Being unproductive is a sin,” said Mistree. “To be spiritual you have to purposefully generate wealth, do it honestly and then share it.”The exhortation to make money perhaps helps explain why many Parsis have been so successful in the world of business. My grandfather would speak about the work of lawyers and accountants with a note of wonder in his voice that some might reserve for spectacular works of art. “He is good with money” was perhaps his ultimate compliment. The most famous of the historical Parsi entrepreneurs was Jamsetji Tata, who was born into a poor family of Parsi priests in Gujarat in 1839, made his first money in the opium trade, and eventually became one of the 19th century’s most prominent industrialists and philanthropists. His holdings went on to become Tata Group, which today is one of the world’s largest companies.Our tour group was granted an audience with Jamsetji’s 82-year-old great-grandson Ratan Tata, who spent more than two decades as chair of the group and still runs its charitable trusts. One afternoon, we drove to an office block in Mumbai’s business district and filed into a meeting room inside. Tata entered soon after, stooped and hesitant, his wavy grey hair in a side parting. Sitting below a portrait of his ancestors, he spoke to us for an hour. He was delighted that we were taking an interest in our Zoroastrian roots, and described his vision of a typical Parsi as “happy and joyful rather than revengeful and destructive”. Yet Tata seemed to have a pall of sadness over him, I thought, as he reflected on his own history as part of the community. When an earnest member of our group asked him to recount a time when his faith had positively influenced his life, he spoke instead of his escape from his overbearing Parsi family to the US, where he was able to study architecture and finally felt free and happy, before he was dragged back to India to be installed in the family business.The evening before, we had paid a house call on Jimmy Mistry, a Parsi hotelier and bon vivant whose exuberance could hardly be more at odds with Tata’s melancholy, understated vibe. Mistry had built himself an ostentatious tower block in the suburb of Dadar, and had decorated its soaring exterior with oversized motifs of winged lions and bearded warriors, in homage to the grand ruins of Persepolis in Iran, the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid empire, whose dominant religion was Zoroastrianism. On the ground floor of Mistry’s block, there was a newly built fire temple, where our group stopped for a prayer. As this was a private temple, the fire had not been consecrated and so it was a rare case when, as a non-Parsi, I was allowed to enter. But as I went to fix a head-covering, copying the others in the group, Sherry, our young priest companion, accosted me. “It’s better if you wait outside,” he said firmly. I sat alone in a wicker chair, listening to the lilting intonations of the priest waft from the temple without being able to see a thing.After the half-hour of prayer, we ascended in a lift and emerged into a dining room on the 19th floor, where a glass sculpture of a horse was suspended from the ceiling. A husky wearing a jewelled cravat padded across the chequered marble floor to greet us, and then came the host, wearing a tight black T-shirt and Louis Vuitton loafers. “Welcome to my humble abode,” Mistry said with a grin. We stepped on to a roof terrace just in time for the hazy sunset, and were then ushered up a floor to yet another terrace, where we chatted with Mistry and his family over canapes. It was a disgrace, he said, that there were so many rich Parsi businessmen who were not following the Zoroastrian command to spread their wealth. “Enough of silent charity, tell us what the fuck you’ve done for the community! We need to start shaming people,” he said. I asked him how money could help reverse the decline in the Parsi population. What about taking a more inclusive line on who can be a Parsi? “Patrilineality is the only thing that has saved us over the centuries and allowed us to keep our identity,” he said, as the city darkened below.Our programme in Mumbai came to an end, and we left early in the morning for the hill station of Lonavala. Mistry had organised a team-building exercise for us at a retreat he owned, where corporate executives receive military-style counter-terrorism training. After a bumpy hour in a jeep and then a short boat ride, we arrived at the luxury bootcamp, where the rooms had Kalashnikov lamp-stands and hand-grenade door handles, as well as Mistryisms engraved into various fixtures. “‘A gun is like a woman: it’s all about how you hold her’ – Jimmy Mistry” was etched into my bedside table. As the sun set, we were told to stand to attention as the national anthem played, and then the staff handed out fatigues to change into for the exercises, which I decided to skip, feeling a little queasy at the militarism. A billboard informed guests that the complex had been set up to help Indians take revenge for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which Pakistani gunmen killed more than 150 people.This kind of patriotism has helped the Parsis to remain unscathed as India’s turn towards Hindu extremism intensifies under prime minister Narendra Modi. “Their love is without condition, without any expectation, and therefore the purest possible,” Modi said back in 2011, when he was still chief minister of Gujarat, suggesting that the Parsis were a model minority that others would do well to follow. Money has also helped: the Tata group has been the most lavish donor to Modi’s BJP party in recent years, with one of the Tata trusts giving 3.6bn rupees (£36.2m) in the 2018-19 financial year. The Parsis have long prided themselves on being able to get along with the rulers of the day, whoever they may be, and even the Parsi origin story reflects this knack for astute political messaging. When the refugees from Persia landed, so the tale goes, the Hindu king of Gujarat produced a full glass of milk, to signal that there was no space for new arrivals. The Persians stirred a spoonful of sugar into the milk without spilling any, to show they would sweeten the kingdom without disturbing it.For the second half of our tour, we journeyed north to Gujarat. One of our first stops was Sanjan, the port where our ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago. A hot wind buffeted us as Sherry led a brief prayer on the sandy banks of the Varoli river, at the spot where the arriving Persians may or may not have produced that spoonful of sugar, and then we continued further north.There was an energy and excitement inside our tour bus during the long journeys of the next few days, despite the unavoidable theme of ageing and decay that marked much of the trip. We played raucous games of Mafia and danced in the aisle to songs blasted through a bluetooth speaker. Sherry was a ringleader in both the card games and the dancing, rallying the troops and wiggling his hips to the music. A popular choice was Bohemian Rhapsody, sung by the most famous Parsi of them all, Farrokh Bulsara. Born to Parsi parents from Gujarat who resettled in Zanzibar for business, Bulsara went to school near Mumbai, moved to Britain in 1964 and soon took the name Freddie Mercury. He was quietly ignored by much of the community owing to his life choices and sexuality – I remember once perusing a book of 100 Famous Parsis at a relative’s house and finding multiple bridge construction engineers, but no Freddie Mercury – but the young diaspora Parsis on the bus had no qualms in claiming him as one of their own.I started to ponder the idea of having a late-in-life navjote, egged on by many of the friendly co-participants in the tour, who thought it would be a fun excuse to all meet up again. I floated the idea with Sherry, but as we got chatting on the bus, I quickly realised I had been mistaken to infer from his bleached hair and carefree demeanour that he was a reformer and would approve of the idea. In Zoroastrianism, there is no need to be ascetic or severe in order to be conservative. Sherry told me that if either parent was not a Parsi, the child was not one either, and he would not perform a navjote. He did not even accept the century-old ruling allowing navjotes for those children who have just a Parsi father. It seemed odd, given that Sherry was clearly devoted to the community’s survival, and spoke with visible passion about his work as a priest. Wasn’t this kind of attitude hastening its decline? “We want to focus on quality, not just quantity,” he said.I pointed out to him that there were many people on our tour who might end up marrying non-Parsis. Was it really necessary to kick them and their offspring out of the religion? “They know what they’re getting into,” he said, in a tone that brooked no further discussion. Sherry combined a fervent commitment to religious dogma and ritual with a remarkably warm, laid-back attitude to just about every other aspect of life. It was a curious combination, but one I came to recognise in many Parsis we met.We arrived late one evening in Udvada, the small Gujarat town that houses the holiest fire in all Zoroastrianism, the Iranshah. Laying eyes on the Iranshah was set to be the highlight of the tour for most of the group. If legend is to be believed, the fire was consecrated shortly after the arrival of the Parsis in India, and has been burning constantly for more than a millennium. The current temple that houses it dates from the 1740s, and before priests are allowed to conduct prayer ceremonies there, they must undergo a nine-day purification ritual, during which they can have no human contact. The narrow lanes that make up the centre of old Udvada are lined with once-spectacular Parsi mansions now mostly fallen into disrepair. Just a handful of Parsi families still live in the town, though there are a number of inns for the pilgrims who come regularly from Mumbai and across the world. We checked into one of them, which had simple rooms that were bare save for a bed, a ceiling fan and a small representation of Zarathustra on the wall.The next day, while everyone else went to take the requisite pre-prayer shower, I paid a visit to Khurshed Dastoor, the Iranshah’s high priest. He lived across from the temple, in a villa with windows open to the street, through which he was visible sitting at a desk, dressed in white. Dastoor beckoned me into his home with a flick of the wrist. He had a week of beard, and meaty earlobes that reminded me of my grandfather’s. Now 57, he had undergone priestly training at the same time as studying business and economics in Mumbai. On the wall were portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, and he could trace his lineage back 21 generations, all of them high priests of the Iranshah fire. He took up the role in 2002, when his father died. “Sometimes I thought I didn’t want to do it, but then I realised I had no choice. I think if you are born into this kind of family, you’re stamped that you will become a priest,” he said, brushing away persistent mosquitoes as he spoke.Dastoor told me that nowhere in the Zoroastrian texts does it say children from mixed families should not be allowed to be Zoroastrians. When I asked him about Mistree’s assertion that people like my grandfather who chose to be cremated would go to hell, he became irate. “This is where we’ve gone wrong as a religion,” he said. He told me that while he would personally prefer to be consigned to a dakhma, adherence to ritual and dogma was a secondary concern: “The improvement of your soul, ideas, the kindness you show to people, to help educate and show charity to your family, your whole community and all of society – this is how we should measure a good Zoroastrian.”I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of the religion’s highest priests was a reformer. I asked him whether, if I did decide to have a navjote from a liberal priest, I would be allowed into his temple to see the Iranshah fire. He shook his head, with perhaps a hint of regret. He was bound by the regulations of the town’s nine-priest council, and while he was open to discussing all kinds of reform, the votes were always eight to one against him. Even his mild utterances in favour of change had got him “in a soup” with traditionalists, he said.Still, he was adamant that the community would need to make serious changes if it was going to survive. But what, exactly? He sighed. “If I said conversion, I would be torn down. It’s not the right time and not the right place. But we have to think of something. Though, to be honest, I doubt we can make a difference. I don’t see any optimistic future.”There was something inspiring about the people we had met who were upholding a tradition that went back more than three millennia. I felt proud of my connection to this heritage, and a little deflated that I could never become a “real” Parsi. Still, it was hardly devastating for someone who had not previously felt a strong connection to the community. I was more interested how some of the others on the trip felt, especially the women. They had grown up practising the religion, had been interested enough to come on this trip, and were being told they would be kicked out if they married out. Many said they would prefer to marry a Parsi, but most accepted this was unlikely, given how few they met in their normal lives. Our tour had not, as far as my sleuthing could detect, resulted in the formation of any new Zoroastrian couples.“It’s very sad, but it’s only in India,” said Tanya, a 28-year-old film-maker, born in Karachi and raised in Toronto, on being told she was no longer a Parsi if she married out. While she was proud of both her Zoroastrian faith and her Parsi heritage, she thought it absurd to insist that the Parsis should be the religion’s only gatekeepers. In the diaspora communities of North America, fire temples are open to everyone, and there is no controversy over navjotes for children of mixed parentage, she told me. The small community of Iranian Zoroastrians is even more liberal, allowing female priests, and there are also nascent neo-Zoroastrian movements in parts of the Middle East. “Zoroastrianism will always be there, it doesn’t need a race to exist,” she said. “I’d rather the religion flourishes and moves on and affects people positively than it’s a secret club you are born into.”As the tour approached its end, we visited Navsari, the city from which the Tata family originated, and where both of my Parsi great-grandmothers were born and raised. We stopped at a library that housed ancient Persian and Gujarati Zoroastrian texts, the grand reading room adorned with portraits of illustrious Parsis of yore. We also stopped at the Vadi Daremeher, a seminary that has trained Parsi priests for nearly nine centuries, but no longer has any students.On my last day before leaving India, I met with the Parsi leader Dinshaw Tamboly, who has long been an outspoken reformist voice, and was the driving force behind the creation of the prayer hall and crematorium where my grandfather’s funeral had taken place. He wanted to be cremated when he died, he told me, and was adamant that new voices would win out over traditionalists in the end. As we spoke, his phone flickered into life with an urgent message. An elderly priest in Mumbai had accidentally set himself on fire while praying in his fire temple, and died.The news made me think about two elderly priests I had met a couple of days earlier, when we hopped off the bus at Nargol, a coastal town where the formerly sizeable Parsi population has dwindled to just a few families. Darabshaw Govadia was 86 and could barely walk he was helped by his brother Rusi, a former bus driver who, at 80, was marginally sprightlier. Both priests were living inside the local temple, a handsome yellow structure with a sloping roof and fringed with lush greenery. They tended the fire throughout the day and night, always wearing their billowing white robes and receiving their meals from the town in tiffin boxes. They told me they had just a few visitors each day.I asked who would replace them when they were no longer physically able to perform their duties. “We don’t know,” said Darabshaw in a croaky whisper. We concluded our stilted chat as the rest of the group emerged from saying their prayers, and we all assembled around the brothers on the steps of the temple for a group photograph. Then, it was time for us to leave. The two brothers smiled faintly in farewell, and shuffled back into the temple, to resume the prayers at their sacred flame. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858a6719b2f26b65a6720191b93a60c5ce609713/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48db5f6281a006f0e7cf85a4bd4373a3","title":"papua new guineas massive ok tedi mine closes as covid cases spread to new areas","story":"Operation shuts for 14 days as coronavirus infections rise more than ten-fold in three weeksCases of Covid-19 in Papua New Guinea have spread to new provinces, forcing the closure of the massive Ok Tedi mine, and sparking warnings that a surge in infections, potentially in the thousands, could strike the country in the next few months.Seven workers at the Ok Tedi mine near the Indonesian border have tested positive to Covid-19. The mine has traced the infections back to a single worker who is believed to have contracted the virus from a person who had flown from Port Moresby to Kiunga on a commercial flight late last month.“The employee is currently working in our operations, travelling to and from work on buses. It is likely that more people have been infected, giving rise to an unacceptable risk of accelerated transmission within the Ok Tedi workforce,” the mine’s chief executive Musje Werror said in a statement.Ok Tedi mine – a hugely profitable gold and copper mine worth billions to the PNG government’s already-parlous finances – will be shut for “at least 14 days to limit further transmission and allow contact tracing, isolation and testing procedures to be implemented”.PNG has now recorded 153 confirmed cases – low by global standards – but a record jump of 39 in a day, and up from 11 just three weeks ago. There have also been two deaths.Professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Papua New Guinea, Dr Glen Mola, said PNG’s new case numbers were to be expected, and would worsen. Covid-19 was slow to reach PNG initially, he said, and the country is now showing the rising trends most countries were exhibiting two or three months ago.“In August we will have hundreds of positive test infections and perhaps thousands in September to December. But we must stay calm and handle things as best we can fear of the epidemic could be worse than the actual epidemic itself,” Mola said.“Let’s hope we can ‘flatten the curve’ sufficiently to allow our health system to not fall over, but without locking down the country so much that the whole country ‘falls over’ economically.”A significant number of cases have been recorded among health workers in the capital, Port Moresby, raising concerns that medical staff are not being given adequate protective equipment or that hygiene protocols are failing.Workers at the country’s dedicated Covid isolation ward – a converted netball centre in Port Moresby – have gone on strike because they haven’t been paid.

As recently as six months ago, officials inspecting the consignment warned that if not moved it would “blow up all of Beirut”. The government, facing popular fury, said it was putting an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how the highly explosive materials came to be stored less than 100 metres from residential neighbourhoods.In 2014 a Russian-owned vessel carrying the chemical – a fertiliser that can be used in bombs – was impounded at Beirut’s port, with its load apparently confiscated and taken ashore. Various reports said a fire started at a warehouse in the port before spreading to the ammonium nitrate’s storehouse and igniting the contents.The explosion has left much of East Beirut uninhabitable and 300,000 people are said by the governor to have fled the city. International rescue crews have begun flying in to help with the search for survivors. Martin Chulov writes: “Ground zero of the explosion that destroyed much of the Lebanese capital was an enormous arc of warehouses, restaurants, homes and shops that, until Tuesday evening, were the still-functioning heart of an already dying city … Grappling with the cause of such a catastrophic event looms as yet another test for a government that has failed to convince many Lebanese that it is up to implementing a stated goal of introducing accountability. ‘If any country wants to help us, please help institutions you can trust,’ said Fady Haddad, a doctor. ‘Not through the government.’” Here is how anyone wishing to donate can help.Grace Millane killer appeals – The man convicted of murdering the British backpacker Grace Millane in Auckland, New Zealand, has begun an appeal against his guilty verdict and jail term. “This appeal is about whether the trial process miscarried,” his defence lawyer, Rachel Reed, told an Auckland court hearing today. In November, a jury took just five hours to unanimously agree that the accused, whose name is suppressed, murdered Millane, 22, in his hotel room after the pair met on a date in Auckland in December 2018. He hid her body in a suitcase and buried it in bushland. In February a judge sentenced the 28-year-old to life in prison with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. His lawyer indicated in March that he would appeal.Coronavirus latest – Nicola Sturgeon has warned a lockdown in Aberdeen could extend to other towns after health officials linked 32 pubs and golf courses to the outbreak in the city.

Ofgem, the energy regulator, is expected on Friday to announce a sharp reduction to its cap on standard dual-fuel energy tariffs, which could knock between £85 and £100 a year from the average energy bill.Interest in camping pitches upwards – A new wave of first-time campers are splurging on portable firepits and comfy airbeds as camping enjoys a revival in tandem with the UK staycation boom.Despite doom and gloom on much of the high street and the cancellation of the music festival season, retailers say shoppers have been snapping up tents, sleeping bags and cooking equipment, with many camping staples selling out.  readers have been bitten by the camping bug after lockdown – but as they told Molly Blackall, things don’t always go as planned.While Donald Trump continues to claim the US is “doing very well” in its fight against Covid-19, the figures suggest a different story.

Abused and deported, his future is uncertain but his European dream intactRahman was out buying food when Spanish police handed him a €500 fine for breaking coronavirus restrictions. “I’ll pay this as soon as I get a residence permit,” he told them. He laughs as he recalls the incident. “Look how thin I’ve become, I weigh only 57 kilos,” he says. The 21-year-old Palestinian shows his skinny 5ft 7in frame over the webcam.He speaks in Swedish mixed with Norwegian expressions – his capacity in both languages is testament to the nearly five years spent between the countries as an adolescent. They were formative years, where he learned that even apparently kind gestures such as the offer of a place to stay could open the door to unfathomable cruelty.It was a time when no matter what Rahman suffered, the legal right to remain in Europe eluded him. His lack of status enabled appalling crimes to be committed against him, and it left the criminals unpunished. He has been exploited and deported but his dream of Europe endures. He has found his way back to the continent but the future is uncertain.In October 2013, 15-year-old Rahman arrived in Sweden alone. Like so many other young refugees, he had heard good things about Sweden: children are protected, they get to attend school and feel safe, their rights are respected and almost all get to stay.He grew up in Jordan, his Palestinian parents refugees from Gaza. Jordan’s citizenship laws had no place for Rahman, leaving him stateless. When the war in Syria was in its third year, his father wanted to send him across the border to fight the Syrian regime. His mother disagreed and the teenager fled to what she hoped would be a place of safety.In Sweden, Rahman lived in a refugee shelter, started school and quickly learned the language. He played football in his spare time. But despite his young age and troubles in Jordan, the court of migration in Stockholm rejected his asylum application in the summer of 2014.With no idea of what to do, Rahman left the youth hostel in Stockholm to avoid being deported, and cut off contact with his state-appointed .That is when he met Martin: a man in his 30s, with a shaved head and heavy gold chains around his neck. Once Martin understood Rahman’s situation, he invited him to a flat in central Stockholm.When he got there Rahman was shocked. Some people were sniffing glue, others were using cocaine. He was given a drink – his first taste of alcohol. The night became a haze. Martin took him into a room. Rahman was struck to the ground and felt hands on his body.The rapes and beatings continued for months. Martin threatened to kill him if he tried to run away. Rahman had seen guns and knives around the flat and did not dare argue or ask questions. “I had nowhere to go. No money. And there was no one to help me,” he says.A lot of people came to the flat, and it was Rahman’s job to keep it clean. He was given takeaway food and drugs. Martin would call at any hour and send him off with a bag and address to deliver it to. He was sent on drug trips across Europe, for which he was given new clothes, a fake passport and a bag to carry. Rahman, usually on drugs, slept through the flights.He is among thousands of children who have come to Sweden in recent years only to go missing when their European dreams are shattered. According to the Swedish migration agency, 2,014 unaccompanied minors are missing without trace since 2013 – equivalent to almost 70 school classes. The threat of deportation is often mentioned as a reason for these disappearances, as is human trafficking.But no one really knows, because no one is searching for them. The police keep records but often do not actively search for the children. Municipalities say children no longer resident in their area are not their responsibility. The migration agency says it cannot examine the cases of missing children. In 2016, the UN human rights committee criticised Sweden for failing to prevent these disappearances.Many, like Rahman, are vulnerable to abuse and traffickers. According to a 2015 survey by a Swedish government agency, most suspected child trafficking cases involved unaccompanied minors. At that time, no trafficking investigations involving unaccompanied minors had resulted in a prosecution.To understand where the system was failing, I researched every suspected case of trafficking of minors in Sweden during a four-year period up to 2015. According to police reports and preliminary investigations, more than half of the cases involved sexual slavery, in which nearly half of the victims were boys. The police’s failed response to trafficking was systemic.Rahman was one of those cases. I tracked him down in Norway. After several months, he had managed to escape Martin. On reaching Norway, he again applied for asylum and reported his experience of trafficking to authorities. Rahman and his lawyer felt the authorities did not take his case seriously. Because the alleged trafficking took place in Sweden, Norwegian police passed the investigation to their Swedish colleagues. Rahman did not trust the investigators in either country. They did not seem to realise how dangerous it would be for him to single out Martin with no witness protection.Shortly after Rahman turned 18, we spent a few days at a seaside resort. Surrounded by glittering Norwegian fjords, he and his court-appointed  sat outside on a mild summer evening. He leaned against her with his big ragged hair and gentle smile. “She’s like a mother to me,” he said.The Swedish trafficking investigation was eventually dropped. His asylum application in Norway was also rejected. Now 18, he was no longer technically a child. In the summer of 2018, he was deported to Jordan.After nearly five years in Europe, Rahman struggled with the more socially controlled society in Jordan. He could not return to his strictly religious family: he now smoked, drank alcohol and wore an earring. Without a Jordanian ID, he had no access to medical care or hope of returning to education.The police seemed to relish harassing him. They would ask: why were you in Europe? Why have you come back? He was even mocked by friends and relatives: where’s the money, the success, the expensive things? For a while he worked 12-hour days at a tourist bazaar for wages that did not cover his rent. After a few weeks he decided to leave again.First he attempted to sail to Greece via Turkey but the yellow dinghy was stopped by Turkish coastguards. After a month and a half in a Turkish prison, he returned to Jordan. He had a Norwegian girlfriend at the time. As a European, she could come to visit for a few weeks. Rahman has none of these options.His friends in Norway arranged for him to stay with people they knew in Kosovo and he planned to continue overland further into Europe. But he was arrested in Montenegro and sent back to Kosovo. He became severely ill and returned to Jordan. But he was already making new plans to reach Europe.“I can’t build a life here,” he said in the summer of 2019. “I want to go to Europe again. I am never giving up.”This time he went to Morocco. Rahman knew this was his most dangerous journey so far. “But I am going to make it, I am sure of it,” he insisted. Later that summer, he reached the Moroccan border with the Spanish enclave of Melilla.This gateway to Europe is marked with high razor wire fences and monitored by drones. Migrants and Moroccan boys his age were everywhere, hoping to get through the border at night. Some had been trying for months, even years. Rahman’s plan was to swim around the sea fences, a treacherous feat as border guards sometimes fire plastic bullets at swimmers. His first four attempts failed and he was hurt in a fall before he finally managed to swim into the port of Melilla.“I am so happy – I am in Europe again!” he said in a message.Afraid of being forced back to Morocco, he stowed away onboard a cargo ship to mainland Spain. He was given a place in a refugee shelter and €50 a month to live on. But this assistance was cut after six months, just as the coronavirus pandemic hit Europe.As we kept in touch over the years, I would always ask how he was and he always replied: “Good,” no matter the circumstances. He has to stay positive, he says, to keep going towards what he longs for: an ordinary life, with a home. He would like to study languages and maybe work with tourists as he is so used to meeting new people.But there is little space to talk about the future right now. Rahman does not even know what tomorrow will bring, where he will sleep or how he will eat. He is considering two unwanted options: start selling drugs again or commit a crime deliberately to get caught. “If I get arrested, I have somewhere to live until corona is over,” he said.Rahman’s European dream has brought him back. Despite the trials he has gone through, the stateless boy is now a young man but no closer to having papers. The asylum process in Spain is long, up to 18 months, and uncertain – and that was before the pandemic. He thinks of Sweden or Norway but doubts his chances. From Scandinavia to Jordan, he has never been granted the right to belong. “Why is that?” he asks. “Why can’t I be legal anywhere?”Rahman’s name has been changed and his photograph in the main image obscured to protect his identity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced2c704e664950358a777bd4f27113ef711479b/0_107_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc00cb0fb79c4668b9d54aa9f1a7545","title":"beirut explosion aftermath lebanon in pictures","story":"Lebanon is in mourning and surveying the damage to its capital, Beirut, after a massive explosion ripped through the city’s port and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

Asked about the reports on Thursday, a Department for Transport spokeswoman said this week’s review of travel corridor arrangements has not yet been published.Scotland’s health secretary has played down the prospects of Aberdeen’s emergency lockdown being extended to other parts of the economy or the region after the outbreak in cases there.Jeane Freeman said NHS Grampian’s contact tracers had so far found and spoken to all 191 people identified as being in close contact with the 54 people known to be infected in the city, and all had been told to self-isolate for 14 days.Freeman confirmed ministers would act quickly if there was evidence of wider community transmission, but that had not yet emerged. Further data would be published later on Thursday, she said, to show whether new Covid-19 cases had emerged in the city or wider area.The first minister warned on Wednesday that Aberdeen’s emergency lockdown could extend to other towns in the region after health officials linked 32 pubs and golf courses to the outbreak in the city.Soames also defended the fact that the average contact tracer has contacted 2.4 people each.Let me tell you, we’ve got 10 Nightingale hospitals lying vacant, we’ve got 30,000 ventilators that are not being used. The government has to start somewhere with capacity and the fact is that we’ve got too much capacity, or more capacity than we need right here, right now, today.But, naturally, the government has taken a decision to over-provide to begin with on the basis that we can always reduce it.I mean, we could increase the number of calls per agent by reducing the number of agents who are there and I am pretty sure that the government, over the coming weeks, is going to start reducing the number that we have. But you would expect it to start at a high level and then try to adapt it.The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has defended the number of people being contacted and asked to isolate as part of the test and trace system, saying it is “improving all the time”. Rupert Soames, Serco’s chief executive, told Today:Pushed on the fact that this is only the contacts that tracers have been able to reach, Soames added: “So there’s been 218,000 already contacted.”Questioned again on why tracers are still only managing to get hold of half of people’s contacts, Soames said:If somebody rang you now and I said tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last 48 hours and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details, how many do you think that you’d be able to reel off of the top of your head?Many health and care workers experienced inadequate protection, relied on community donations and even bought their own PPE from DIY shops. Ministers repeatedly assured the country that things were fine, yet lives of health workers were lost, the infection was spread in health settings while all that time masks bought by the government could not be used for their intended purpose.The case for the National Audit Office to investigate the Conservative government’s mishandling of PPE is overwhelming and as well as apologise, ministers must urgently learn lessons to save lives in the future.Responding to the news, the Lib Dem leadership candidate Layla Moran has said:The government has serious questions to answer over this shocking waste of taxpayers’ money.We urgently need a clear strategy for procuring PPE so that NHS and care staff on the frontline are not left without. That should include a review of the process for handing out contracts to prevent these colossal errors from happening again.It’s vital that ministers act on the recommendations of the cross-party inquiry I’m chairing so that lessons are learned ahead of a potential second spike later this year.The government has admitted that 50m masks bought as part of a £252m medical supplies contract awarded to an investment firm have been deemed unsuitable for use by NHS workers.Two organisations are seeking judicial review of the decision to award the contract to Ayanda Capital, which describes itself as specialising in “currency trading, offshore property, private equity and trade financing”.EveryDoctor and the Good Law Project published correspondence with the government’s legal department in which the latter acknowledged the masks would not be used by the NHS because of concerns they will not fit tightly enough.The government declined to comment on ongoing legal proceedings but a spokesman has said:Throughout this global pandemic, we have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect people on the frontline.Over 2.4bn items have been delivered, and more than 30bn have been ordered from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply, which meets the needs of health and social care staff both now and in the future.There is a robust process in place to ensure orders are of high quality and meet strict safety standards, with the necessary due diligence undertaken on all government contracts.Returning to the planning story, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said he wishes he had not sat next to Tory party donor and developer Richard Desmond at an event.Asked why people should trust him over new planning proposals that will give more power to large developers after the controversy over the Westferry development project, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:I don’t think this does give more power to developers, it creates a much more certain system. It will, for example, fix the challenge of developer contributions once and for all.Asked what he had learned from the experience of the Westferry development, Jenrick added:I’ve set out the events around that decision and there are definitely lessons to be learnt. I wish I hadn’t been sat next to a developer at an event and I regret sharing text messages with him afterwards.But I don’t regret the decision, because I think it was right to get housing built on a brownfield site on a part of London that desperately needs it.The system that I’ve helped to design that is set out in the proposals we’re publishing today will actually move us forward significantly on some of the challenges that that case rose.Jenrick claimed he had “no idea” how much property developers have donated to his party in the last year, saying: “Ministers are not involved in those issues, that is entirely for the Conservative party.” He added: “You’re entirely mischaracterising what we’re doing here. We’re actually asking developers to pay more.” He said the government was “saying we’re going to abolish the current system which favours the big developers”.Preston could be the next area to face government intervention after a rise in coronavirus rates, the city council’s chief executive said.The authority has advised residents in the Lancashire city to avoid having visitors to their homes, although there are no official restrictions such as the laws brought in for other parts of the county, as well as Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Adrian Phillips said:We are not waiting for some government announcement. We know our rates are increasing and they have increased over the last week to a level now where we are concerned that we could face government intervention. We’ve been working with our communities to make sure we get those key messages out.The council has also advised residents to wear face coverings at all times and to get tested even if they are experiencing only mild symptoms.A statement on the authority’s website said evidence from Public Health England showed a spike of coronavirus cases in Preston, with the majority of the spread through households and community.The city is surrounded by areas that have had enforced measures implemented by government and we want to act now to stop that from happening (in) Preston.We are aware we have got community transmissions, we are aware they are across the city. There is a concentration in inner areas as there usually is in any urban environment. But it’s in villages, it’s in our suburbs. Covid has not gone away and it is us all taking that message onboard and making sure that we don’t relax our guard too much, that we maintain those key issues.The director of the Town and Country Planning Association called on the government to provide evidence as to how the current planning system is “desperately broken”. Hugh Ellis told Today:Change is a good thing to planning, there’s no doubt about that, but the most important thing is that people’s voice is not going to be enhanced, this is not a democratisation of planning and that is really troubling to us.So, people might struggle to involve themselves in the system at the moment but they do get two bites of the cherry, they can have an involvement in the plan, they can comment on planning applications. Half that process is going to effectively disappear.Just to be absolutely clear, the planning system in England consented 370,000 units for housing last year in the year and the Local Government Association estimates that there are 1m consents not built.So, I’m sorry, the government are going to have to present some detailed evidence which is not in the white paper about why they say the planning system is desperately broken.Jenrick told the same programme there was a need for more homes and land on which to build them, citing constituents who have complained younger people are struggling to get on the property ladder.Claims the government’s planning reforms would lead to slums are “complete nonsense”, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, has claimed.The proposals include a scheme that would remove a whole stage of local oversight within designated zones by setting pre-approved “design codes” that would see some applications given an automatic “green light”.The government is seeking a way to make it easier to build new homes but the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) described the proposals as “shameful” and said they would do “almost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes”. Instead, they could lead to the “development of the next generation of slum housing”. Speaking on Sky News on Thursday morning, Jenrick said:Today, it takes seven years to produce a local plan, we want to reduce that to around two and a half years. And it can take five years to get spades in the ground on a housing estate. We believe that can be cut very significantly and everybody will benefit from that – the people who work in the industry and those people who want to get on the housing ladder as well.Asked whether the public will have less of a say on planning decisions, he added:We want to have a meaningful local engagement and that is at the planning making stage. So what our proposals will do, it will mean that when the plan is being produced, there will be a really serious debate in a local community about where they want homes to be built.Asked about the RIBA’s comments, Jenrick said:That, I’m afraid, is complete nonsense. I saw those comments and they were put out before we’d even published the document.The Citizens Advice service is helping people with redundancy queries every two minutes, according to its director of external affairs. Katie Martin has told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:We’ve been seeing case after case of people coming to Citizens Advice for help around redundancy – in particular, selection for redundancy and potential questions around discrimination.So we’re helping somebody about once every two minutes at the moment and visits to our advice pages on selection for redundancy have doubled in the last couple of months.We’ve also conducted some polling that suggests that disabled people, parents, carers and those people who have previously been shielding are more than twice as likely to be at risk of redundancy as other workers.So it is a really, really concerning trend and something that we feel really needs to be addressed.The comments come as recruitment firms report record numbers of people in Britain looking for temporary work. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation and the accountancy firm KPMG said the number of people signing up rose in July at the fastest pace since records began in 1997.Good morning and welcome aboard the ’s live blog, where we’ll be keeping a particularly close eye out for the latest data on England’s contact tracing system. They’re due to be published at 11am, amid concerns about the effectiveness of the operation.On Wednesday, my colleagues Sarah Marsh and Molly Blackall revealed that, despite the prime minister’s grand claims, some people working on it have said they are making only a handful of calls every month and are occupying their time with barbecues and quizzes.That came only a day after Josh Halliday reported that English councils with the highest infection rates had felt it necessary to launch their own contact-tracing operations to plug holes in the “world-beating” £10bn central government system. And here’s a little more background on the contact tracing operation:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323086.1596655633!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students to wear face coverings in lectures where two metre distance not possible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe guidance has also recommended that colleges develop one-way systems to enter and exit indoor spaces. Photograph: iStockThird level students will have to wear face coverings during lectures if they are sitting between one and two metres apart, new guidance has recommended.Recommendations which seek to ensure the safe resumption of on-campus activity in the Autumn, the Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in HEIs (Higher Education Institutes), were published byMinister for Higher Education Simon Harris on Wednesday .The guidance, which was drawn up by senior public health experts within the sector and endorsed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, suggests a number of methods to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on education campuses.It recommends that a physical distance of two metres during lectures should be maintained where possible. However, it acknowledges there are situations where tuition can only be “realistically” delivered with less than two metres - but no less than one metre - distancing between students. In those instances, face coverings should be worn, the guidance states.In the event that tuition requires the staff member to be less than two metres from students, the staff member should wear face shields, visors or other protective equipment which will be provided by the college or university.The maximum number of people allowed in a class will be 50, under the current public health advice relating to indoor gatherings. However, the guidance states this may change in accordance with the evolving Covid-19 situation nationally.The guidance has also recommended that colleges develop one-way systems to enter and exit indoor spaces and that additional time should be allocated for this to prevent congestion.HEIs are also advised to control access to student accommodation. Students should not visit buildings other than the one where they live and should not invite guests to the residences. Students who are not residents in college accommodation should not access the buildings, the guidance states.The document also suggests that alternative residential space for students who develop Covid-19 symptoms may be required to prevent the spread of the virus in communal accommodation complexes.The public health guidelines does not put any maximum time limit on the length of a teaching session, however it does highlight that if people spend two or more hours in a shared space together, they may be regarded as Covid-19 contacts in the event that someone present subsequently tests positive.After each group leaves a teaching space, high-contact surfaces, such as desk tops and computer keyboard should be cleaned with water and detergent. Disinfectant should not generally be used, the guidance adds.The monitoring of temperatures to access campuses is not required and gloves should not be worn unless required for other reasons, such as in a research laboratory.Colleges and universities have welcomed the publication of the guidelines and are now working to finalise plans for the next academic year, in collaboration with staff and student representatives.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Energy companies bid against each other for contracts of 16.5 years to provide serviceThe combination of sea-level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding by 2050In throwing out State\u0026rsquos Climate Mitigation Plan, judges have done a real service to Irish democracy"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

However, four new cases involved community transmission, meaning the source of the infection was unclear.Some 81 per cent of the new cases were aged under 45 years. There were 31 cases among men and 19 among women.Co Wexford recorded the highest number of new cases, with 11. There were also 10 new cases in Kildare, six in Dublin, five in Donegal and 18 spread across nine other counties (Carlow, Cork, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary and Wicklow).“Covid-19 is an extremely contagious virus and we have seen a significant increase in its spread across multiple counties over recent days. We are monitoring this very closely,” Dr Glynn said.“Our focus over the coming weeks will be on continuing every effort to slow the spread of the virus so that our schools can reopen, our healthcare services resume, and our nursing homes are protected.”No increase in eight countiesMeanwhile, only eight counties recorded no increase in Covid-19 cases over the past week, according to HSE figures.There was no change in the number of Covid-19 cases in the week up to last Sunday in counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Longford, Roscommon, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow, data from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) shows.The biggest increase in cases were recorded in Cos Dublin and Kildare, each with an additional 46 cases. A further 31 cases occurred in county Laois, and 11 more in Co Limerick.Public health officials have indicated that many of the new cases relate to outbreaks in food processing plants, or among at-risk groups.Over the past week, travel accounted for an additional 14 cases, the HPSC epidemiological reports indicate.Community transmission - where the cause of an infection is not apparent - was involved in an additional 59 cases, with the rate of occurrence of community transmission picking up pace during the week. Overall, the was an increase of 319 cases during the week.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland on Wednesday, it emerged more than 6,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus. The latest figures published by the North’s Department of Health revealed 10 more cases of Covid-19 bring the total to 6,006.However no new fatalities have been recorded in Northern Ireland for almost three weeks, leaving the total death toll at 556 — according to the departmental figures which are based on those who previously tested positive for the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister for Justice says new measures will be implemented within 10 weeksExpert group was appointed by government after the 2018 Belfast rape trialReport calls on Garda to set up sex crime units in all isions as a matter of urgencyDPP directs pair be tried on indictment by judge and jury at circuit court level, court hearsGuidelines were drawn up by F\u0026aacuteilte Ireland ahead of expected August 10th reopeningTD Jackie Cahill seeks extraordinary meeting of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil Oireachtas membersSome Ministers privately voice concern at endangered pubs and handling of pandemicAs a small state with a highly mobile people, a local approach may undermine community spiritIndustry group says it has put proposals to the Government to avert any shortagesGarda\u0026iacute and Coast Guard attend scene after incident on Wednesday afternoonNumber of offenders dealt with by the service rose marginally in 2019, annual report showsMourners line route to cemetery as coronavirus restrictions close cathedral grounds to publicPope Francis, the Clintons and the Dalai Lama united in praise of former SDLP leaderSome Ministers of State say they were promised advisers, and do not believe pooled system worksClontarf school is piloting the cycling initiative in effort to minimise coronavirus risksThe recommendation is included in guidance on resuming on-campus activityPatrycja Wyrebek from Poland was found dead at her home i on Sunday morningIrish Travel Agents Association says there is little demand for international travelChild and Family Agency says pandemic had noticeable impact on ability to visit children at homeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4320052.1596381987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup s brexit ads who bankrolled the secretive 435 000 campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Geoghegan contends that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign. Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire On first thoughts it all seemed so wrong that so few were in St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry for John Hume’s funeral.Yet on just a little bit more reflection it was clearly right. This was always the way that John and his wife, Pat, and the family did business it was about respecting your neighbour, about self-denial and prioritising the needs of others above your own.That was John Hume’s life in a nutshell.This was a time of Covid-19 and that threat must and would be respected, was the insistent line taken by Pat. No exception was made even for one of her own sons, Aidan, living and working in Boston, although his reflection about his father, read by his sister Mo, carried a transatlantic impact.It was a day for the Hume family and also for the SDLP, particularly for some of its veterans from the late 1960s and 1970s.There was something poignant about the likes of Bríd Rodgers, Joe Hendron, Alban Maginness, Gerry Cosgrove, Austin Currie, Tommy Gallagher, Joe Byrne and Sean Farren reminiscing outside the cathedral about past battles on the long road to political resolution.They and Hume created the idea of how to escape from what seemed to be an endless cycle of bloodshed and violence, and in the end succeeded in their ambition, only to see the political prize handed to Sinn Féin.Denis Haughey, who is retired now but for years worked in Europe with Hume when the latter was an MEP, and who himself served for a period as a junior minister at Stormont, recalled a book about John F Kennedy containing an anecdote about someone saying at his funeral, “I don’t think I will ever laugh again.”A colleague responded, “Oh yes, we will laugh again but it is sad to think we will never be young again.”For Haughey it was the loss of a great friend, the end of an era, a sense of vibrant, exciting days fading into the past. “He was the big figure in all our young lives,” he said.More cheerfully Sean Farren beside him thought it oddly comforting that the funeral was taking place the day after Ireland had a sensational one-day cricket victory over England, both teams wearing black armbands in Hume’s honour.“John would have enjoyed that he was a mean left-hand spin bowler, you know,” said Farren.And then adjusting their face coverings, they all trooped into the cathedral behind the Hume family, the President, the Taoiseach, First Minister, Deputy First Minister and other political leaders.Hume would have been happy that Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, who have had their differences over Bobby Storey’s funeral and other issues, sat together, socially distanced, in the same pew, and left the cathedral together.Bridge builderOn the altar were chief celebrant Fr Paul Farren Fr Dinny McGettigan, a cousin of Pat Catholic primate Archbishop Eamon Martin and Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown. Hume, a bridge builder and reconciler, would have been glad too that in the sanctuary of the cathedral were Church of Ireland representatives, Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell and Bishop of Derry and Raphoe Andrew Forster.The Hume children and grandchildren participated in the readings and prayers of the faithful, with Pat looking on proudly.In his tribute John Hume jnr was mindful to say how “eternally grateful” the family were for how people looked out for his father when his great intellect was taken over by dementia. “The kindness shown to him by the people of Derry and Donegal, who stopped to talk to him in the street every day, guided him to protect his independence, and received him with gentleness if he was agitated, was a profound gift to all of us.”And had his dad been alive and in the fullness of his health, and considering the tensions of the world, John jnr knew how “he wouldn’t waste the opportunity to say a few words”.“He’d talk about our common humanity, the need to respect ersity and difference, to protect and deepen democracy, to value education and to place non-violence at the absolute centre.”And, inheriting some of his father’s social justice concerns, he added: “He might also stress the right to a living wage and a roof over your head, to decent healthcare and education. If he were here now, he might quote his friend, Congressman John Lewis, who sadly passed away a few weeks ago, appealing to the ‘goodness of every human being and never giving up’.”John jnr provided a glimpse too of how Hume engaged with his fellow residents when he was admitted to the Owen Mor nursing home in Derry two years ago. “He continued to sing songs every day, to teach them all a wee bit of French, to tell his jokes, to demand more buns, and to question everyone daily about where they came from, their origins and their families.”He also spoke about how his dad “kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years” and how he made the family “laugh, dream, think, and sometimes look at him and scratch our heads in amazement, and on rare occasions bewilderment”.Trembling voiceTributes were read from Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama, Bill Clinton, Boris Johnson and Bono, who more than 22 years ago campaigned with Hume and David Trimble to get the Belfast Agreement referendum over the line in 1998.“We were looking for a negotiator who understood that no one wins unless everyone wins ... and that peace is the only victory,” wrote the U2 frontman.“We were looking for joy and heard it in the song of a man who loved his town so well and his missus even more. We were looking for a great leader and found a great servant. We found John Hume. ”Mo Hume read her brother Aidan’s poem To Da, which outlined in reference to his great friend Seamus Heaney how Hume managed to make “hope and history rhyme”.She held it together but her voice quavered with emotion when she came to the last four most personal lines,I don’t ever think I have said aloud How you made us all so incredibly proud All you ever wanted was to make the world a better place And in that goal you found your ace.At the end of the Mass, Phil Coulter played The Town I Loved So Well. As the family cortege left the cathedral grounds for Derry City Cemetery, there was loud applause from the few hundred people who had gathered quietly outside the cathedral. “You could feel it as well as hear it,” one colleague said of the applause.Bishop McKeown put it well when he said of Hume, “because of his past we can face the future”, but probably the strongest lines of the day came from Fr Farren, who in his homily captured both the power and the latter-stage vulnerability of the Nobel laureate.He described how the cathedral was something of a haven for Hume towards the end of his life, how he would attend, often arriving late, daily evening Mass, sitting and praying quietly at the back of the cathedral.Fr Farren told the congregation how the Gospel reading of the Good Samaritan stopping to assist the man attacked by brigands, as others passed by, was Hume’s favourite reading.Neither did Hume pass by, said Fr Farren. “Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others,” he said.He had a message too for the academics: “When the history of Ireland is written, if Pat Hume’s name is not beside John’s, it will be an incomplete history.”And Fr Farren added: “If ever you want to see a man who gave his life for his country, and his health, that man is John Hume. The world knows it.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323110.1596658082!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no time limits and no pre booking what the unpublished pub reopening guidelines reveal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGary Cusack, owner of Mulligan’s pub, Poolbeg St, prepares for reopening. Photograph: Tom HonanDraft guidelines prepared for the planned reopening of pubs would have seen no limit on the length of time drinkers could spend in a pub.Nor would customers have been required to prebook a time slot as long as physical distancing was observed.The guidelines for so-called “wet pubs”, seen by The , were drawn up by Fáilte Ireland in expectation of the August 10th reopening date going ahead.The Government this week decided against moving to phase four of its reopening plan, meaning pubs that do not serve food will remain closed.The draft guidelines state that prebooking and time-limited slots of 105 minutes\u0027 duration would not be a requirement “if physical distancing of two metres is strictly maintained”.If physical distancing was reduced to one metre, prebooked time-limited slots must be in place for customers, which are a maximum of 105 minutes\u0027 duration plus a minimum of 15 minutes between bookings in order to allow for cleaning and to ensure customers could leave and enter without mixing.In terms of physical distancing, customers would also be asked to stand at least two metres away from other groups of people who were not from the same household.A designated employee should also be stationed at front of house to control physical-distancing measures, the document states.“It is the responsibility of supervisors and managers to ensure that customers do not congregate in groups. Customers should be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.“Prominent signage must explain current physical-distancing practices. This must be accompanied by clear and visible markings that illustrate the safe distancing protocol throughout the premises.”In terms of smoking areas, the capacity must be reviewed and the amount of seating and stools would have to be reduced to ensure the recommended physical-distancing measures were adhered to.Action planThe guidelines state that before reopening, bars and public houses would need to “review how they work and introduce new practices and procedures to ensure everyone stays safe”.Pub owners would also be told to create an action plan, once pubs reopen, that “must reassure employees and customers that safeguarding their health and safety is of the utmost importance”.They must also “appoint at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their workplace”.The guidelines also recommend phased shifts and small teams that have the same combination of people. “This will assist should contact tracing be required.”Employers would also be asked where possible to identify an area on the premises where any customer or employee showing possible Covid-19 symptoms could be isolated from other people.In terms of cleaning, the following items must be cleaned after every use: tables, stools, chairs and seating, trays, bill or tip trays and pens.The guidelines have not yet been published as there have been discussions with industry representatives about customers being allowed to sit at the bar.However, in its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said all customers in pubs would have to sit at tables, and not the bar, when pubs eventually do reopen.NPHET also said the wearing of face coverings should be mandatory for members of staff in bars unless there was a partition between the employee and member of the public.NPHET also recommended that, when pubs were eventually reopened, all premises would have to close daily at 10.30pm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Victoria now has the bulk of infections in Australia, with more than 13,000 cases\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321862.1596554372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"citizens in brexit britain clamour for german passports study shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn anti-Brexit demonstrator waves a Union flag alongside an EU flag outside the Houses of Parliament in London in 2018. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images Britons have rushed for the exits of Brexit Britain, a new study suggests, sparking a brain drain on a scale last seen during the 2004 EU accession of central and eastern European countries – but in the opposite direction. The joint research report, by Berlin’s Social Science Centre and the University of Oxford’s new Berlin outpost, shows that post-Brexit immigrants in Germany are prepared to accept higher risk and even lower pay and conditions to start a new life outside the UK.Outward migration from the UK to EU neighbours has jumped 30 per cent in the last four years, to around 17,000 people annually, with about half attributable to what researchers term the “collective uncertainty” Brexit vote.That uncertainty is visible, too, in naturalisation applications. Compared with pre-Brexit figures, UK citizen applications for another EU passport have jumped 500 per cent – and 2,000 per cent for Germany.“We’re observing a new social migration phenomena and a redefining of what it means to be British-European,” said Daniel Tetlow, a co-author of the study. “In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians.”During the same period migration among other EU member states showed no comparable spikes and, in many cases, stagnated.As well as migration data, researchers Daniel Tetlow and Dr Daniel Auer conducted 46 qualitative, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with British migrants across Germany – a popular destination for a erse cohort of UK emigrants in the last decades.The interviews, covering arrivals from 2007 to 2019, showed a clear ide between pre- and post-Brexit arrivals. Two-thirds of the latter group were prepared to accept a pay cut, or a pay freeze as part of their UK escape plan. They were also significantly greater risk-takers than earlier arrivals: a 40-something male IT consultant said he was still hunting for work in Germany but that “the advantages still outweigh the uncertainty that Brexit brought on my family”.Brexit pushA third of the post-Brexit arrivals conceded they would not have moved had the UK voted to remain in the EU in June 2016. Within 12 weeks of that vote, half of them had departed the UK, compared to the 12 months a majority of pre-Brexit arrivals spent planning their move.“The referendum happened in 2016 – and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol,” said one interviewee, a 40-something male academic. “Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.”One-third of the recent group said Brexit had caused direct mental health problems or depression and, in what researchers called an “irony” of Brexit, new arrivals expressed a greater determination to integrate into German society, in particular by learning German, than in the past.A 30-something female translator who arrived in 2015 said, in her subjective experience, many UK citizens in Germany “do not recognise Britain any longer, and feel ashamed to call themselves British, drawing instead on regional and local identities like Scottish, Welsh, Lancastrian, from Yorkshire.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Now it is the Italians who regard the likes of the US and Brazil with anguish and sympathy.Italy has avoided the kind of second wave – or prolongation of the first wave – that has caused such concern in other countries, including Spain, France and Germany.For the past few weeks, Italy has registered around 150-300 new cases each day, many of them imported by migrants or workers returning from abroad.Deaths are down to single digits each day, a dramatic reduction from the dark days of March and April.On Monday, there were just 159 new cases and 12 deaths, while on Tuesday there were 190 new cases and five deaths. The country’s death toll is just over 35,000.Consensus is emerging as to how the Italians managed to control – the word defeat is far too premature – a virus that went onto ravage so many other countries.There were two key factors: a strict nationwide lockdown which prevented the virus from spreading from badly-affected northern regions to the rest of the country and the rigid enforcement of health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and social distancing.The lockdown, imposed in early March, averted the diffusion of the virus to the dysfunctional south of Italy, where underfunded hospitals lack the resources of those in the wealthy north.  Experts said this would have been a catastrophe. The lockdown was tough, interminable and yet largely respected. For weeks, Italians were not allowed out of their homes unless they had unavoidable work commitments, had to shop for food or buy medicine.Police cars patrolled the streets, relaying messages through megaphones ordering people to stay at home.People caught riding their bikes for pleasure rather than to get to work were heavily fined passengers on buses who did not wear masks were promptly kicked off by the drivers.Italy had one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, according to the Government Response Stringency Index, which compares the measures taken by nations around the world to combat the virus.All of this came at a heavy price – Italy’s GDP is predicted to drop by at least 10 per cent this year as a result of the closure of industry and businesses.But it seems to have worked, and a report released this week showed the extent to which the lockdown shielded the centre and south of Italy from the pandemic.The report, by the Italian health ministry and the national statistics agency, found that nearly 1.5 million Italians have come into contact with the coronavirus – six times more than the official figure.It revealed sharp regional differences – in the northern region of Lombardy, which was hardest hit by the pandemic, 7.5 per cent of the population tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.In Sicily, which was barely touched by the virus, just 0.3 per cent have antibodies, and in half a dozen other southern regions less than one per cent of residents had virus antibodies.Dr Franco Locatelli, a key government adviser on the pandemic, said the geographic variability in the results showed that the lockdown was absolutely crucial in sparing central and southern Italy from the same epidemiological wave that hit the north.The report “confirms that the establishment of red zones in the northern regions and then the national lockdown broke the chain of transmission, separating the north from the south and the islands (of Sicily and Sardinia),” said Roberto Speranza, the health minister.Since the lockdown was eased, anti-coronavirus protocols have been maintained. On buses, trains and ferries, it is compulsory to wear masks and compliance is close to 100 per cent.There has been a remarkable level of consensus over the need to keep wearing masks and they have become part of the fabric of life, with people looping them over their elbows or slipping them into a handbag when they are not needed.Office workers who have returned to work have their temperature tested on arrival and are required to wear masks in communal areas of their offices.Bottles of hand sanitiser and pedal-operated dispensers are ubiquitous and companies have cut the number of people allowed to occupy offices.As Italians flock to the coast for their holidays, even beach bars require people to wear masks as they line up for a cold Peroni or a café macchiato in their bikinis and board shorts– and the majority comply.“It’s clear that we won’t return to normal living until we have a vaccine. It will be found, but it will probably take two years before it is available to everyone,” said Giorgo Palu, a professor of virology at Padua University and a former president of the European Society for Virology.The popular stereotype of Italians being unruly, undisciplined and resistant to following rules and regulations has been turned on its head in the last five months.There may have been cultural factors at play. Italians tend to be anxious over their health – children are told not to run around and sweat too much in the summer and ordered not to swim within an hour or two of eating adults obsess over the dangers of catching a chill or worse from air-conditioning or draughts.Angst over personal health may have encouraged widespread respect of the anti-virus measures.“The trend is positive, thanks to the containment measures that were taken,” Marcello Tavio, the president of the Italian Society of Infectious Diseases, told La Repubblica newspaper.But the hard-won gains of the last few months could easily be lost if people drop their guard and start relaxing.Health experts and ministers are constantly warning that disaster lurks around the corner if Italy becomes too complacent.There is alarm over young people going out at night, crowding into piazzas to socialise, drink and flirt.“We are seeing too many gatherings, with people not taking the necessary precautions,” said Dr Tavio.The holiday island of Capri, near Naples, was so alarmed at the number of tourists congregating in its piazzas that it ordered masks to be worn outside as well as inside.The colder temperatures of the autumn and winter could lead to a dramatic spike in contagions unless health protocols are maintained, said Dr Tavio.“We have to be very careful in the autumn, when the favourable climate conditions of summer will end. The health system will need to intercept new cases at the earliest possible stage.”There is also concern over immigrant workers from Eastern European countries like Romania, and Asian countries like Bangladesh, bringing new cases into the country. A new wave of illegal migrants arriving from Tunisia and Libya is also causing alarm, with some of them found to have Covid-19.Mr Speranza, the health minister, says Italy is by no means out of danger yet.  “We cannot lower our guard. We may be out of the storm, but we are not yet in a safe harbour.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosion chemicals abandoned russian businessman triggered","story":"The timer was ticking from six years ago, when 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were taken from an impounded ship and stored in the port of Beirut. It was a massive bomb just waiting to go off a disaster equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.At least 100 are dead and an astonishing 4,000 are injured in a catastrophe in one of the Middle East’s greatest cities. About 300,000 more are homeless.And all because Igor Grechushkin, the Russian owner of the Rhosus ship, carrying the deadly cargo from Georgia to Mozambique, declared bankruptcy on an unscheduled stop, and was forced to abandon it there. It left the authorities with a fearsome problem, and one they appear to have dealt with by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.  Not for nothing was ammonium nitrate, used in farming as a powerful fertiliser, the explosive  of choice for the IRA during the Troubles. The high-profile mainland bombings at the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1992 and 1993, and the blast at Canary Wharf in February 1996, bringing the first IRA ceasefire to an end, were all fuelled by it. Even the most potent of those devices contained just one five-thousandth of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut on Tuesday. It was also used by Timothy McVeigh in his two-tonne bomb that claimed 168 lives in Oklahoma City in 1995. And it is the Taliban’s preferred option too. For all that, ammonium nitrate can be safely stored. It is stable, under the right conditions. There are international protocols on how much can be held, where, and under what security precautions. It must be kept away from fuel and sources of heat, and many countries require carbon carbonate to be added, which makes it safer.Leaving it dumped in one place since 2104 and in such quantity was always likely to end badly, said Stewart Walker, associate professor in Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University in South Australia. Philip Ingram, an explosives expert and former military intelligence officer, said: “Ammonium nitrate can degrade over time, all the more so if it is stored badly. If it starts to degrade, it gives off heat, and that tends to self-perpetuate. Pressure builds.”All it needs then is an appropriate spark, serious enough ignition. The IRA used small amounts of Semtex. Here, according to reports, it came when a welder was making repairs to improve the security at the warehouse. It is suspected that the building contained fireworks. When the explosion ripped through the port, the firefighters trying to contain the initial blaze are believed to have been incinerated. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey California, said the footage supported the firework-as-ignition theory: “Some of the videos show munitions, what I call popcorning, exploding like ‘pop, pop, pop’. It’s very common to see fires detonate explosives. If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up.” First, the video footage shows a fire with white smoke, consistent, says Professor Walker,  with ammonium nitrate burning. Then, there is a massive blast, orange and brown in colour, consistent with nitrous dioxide, given off when ammonium nitrate explodes.  And finally there is a massive white mushroom cloud, which evoked comparisons to Hiroshima, when the Americans dropped the nuclear bomb that ended World War Two in August 1945. In fact, according to Mr Ingram, it is water condensation, common in massive explosions in humid climates, created by the explosion’s massive supersonic waves.  Those waves then blasted out through Beirut, causing apocalyptic scenes of damage up to 10km away. According to reports, the blast could be heard 150 miles away in Cyprus, while the info-graphic below shows the destruction felt across the city:Mr Ingram explains: “With high-end detonations, supersonic pressure gets magnified, and the bigger the explosion, the more it gets magnified. There are two effects: blowing and sucking.“The over-pressure wave blows everything over in its way, and then there’s a big following dip in pressure. That sucks everything back in. “The bigger the over-pressure wave, the bigger the under-pressure one. Floors rise on the over-pressure wave, and fall on the under-pressure, and it explains why high-rise buildings can collapse.”Mr Ingram says: “It really does depend how close. But as the over-pressure wave passes over, the inidual would feel the air being sucked from his lungs. And if very close, it is possible that his organs would explode. The effect is similar to being in a major car crash.“But that will be very, very few. Most of those who have died will have been hit by falling buildings or debris, and it is the glass and shrapnel that are responsible for such a massive toll of injuries The big shortage at the hospitals will be for blood supplies.” The nitrate came from the Rhosus cargo ship, which was carrying the explosive chemical from Georgia to Mozambique in 2013 when it made an unscheduled stop in Beirut, according to reports from the time. While commonly used as an industrial fertiliser, ammonia nitrate is also a component in mining explosives. Mozambique has significant mineral and mining industries.Mr Grechushkin declared bankruptcy and was forced to abandon the ship there after Lebanese authorities prevented it from sailing on, crew members said. Several sailors were stranded in the country for months.“Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouses,” a shipping report from 2015 said.“The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal.”Lebanese customs officials repeatedly asked for the matter to be handled but said they had received no reply. The  attempted to contact Mr Grechushkin for comment.Lebanon has not tied the Rhosus’s cargo to the blast.Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV on Wednesday that the material had been put in a warehouse on a court order, adding that they knew then the material was dangerous but not to this degree.It is negligence, an official source familiar with the findings of early investigations told Reuters, adding that the issue on storing the material safely had come before several committees and judges and nothing was done to order the material be removed or disposed.Professor Walker told The : “There were a host of circumstances which should never have been allowed to happen: there was too much in one place it needs to be compartmentalised to leave it there for so long is bad practice, and, of course it was a place with a high population density. It could and should have been avoided.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"Lord knows the Lebanese have suffered. They stumbled out of one of the most brutal civil wars in modern times and into a conflict with Israel. Just as it was recovering from that, neighbouring Syria exploded in protest - sending a wave of refugees its way.Lebanon miraculously buffered the storm, only to be hit by an economic crisis so deep it has plunged most of the country into poverty. Trauma - its citizens often grimly joke - has become part of the national psyche.Yet Tuesday’s explosion was something else. I fear it is more than anyone - evenly the famously resilient Lebanese - can bear.I spent more than four years in the capital, Beirut, as a Middle East correspondent for The . It’s a complicated and tumultuous place where tempers and passions run high. If you don’t fall in love with it, you’ve misunderstood it. If you don’t hate it, you’ve probably done something wrong.Anyone who has ever left it - which I did in February - knows you leave a piece of your heart behind.Checking in on Wednesday on friends and old neighbours who had become more like family, there was no good news. Most live in and around the historic entertainment district of Gemmayzeh, which is so close to the port that it was effectively a ground zero.One friend took shards of glass to her head and needed stitches, while one was found badly concussed by the site after he had raced down on his motorbike to report on the initial fire.My “Lebanese mother” Christina broke her arm when she was thrown by the blast’s force. Beirut’s health minister urged people to leave the city in case of any residual noxious fumes, but the 52-year-old mother of three - like most others - had nowhere else to go. She swept up the window fragments and put the broken frame back on her broken bed and tried to sleep.Another sobbed down the phone to me as she walked through a hole in her apartment where her front door had been: “Kil shi, kil shi (everything, everything) my whole life is gone.”  There’s little left of the places we used to frequent: Anise bar where we used to drown our sorrows after a tough day reporting the little fruit and veg shop on the corner and the New York Times reporter’s French mandate apartment where I had my farewell party.It is hard to overestimate the damage done to a country half the size of Wales. More than 300,000 people - a fourth of Beirut’s population - have been made homeless overnight. The anaemic state, without serious international help, is incapable of rebuilding. Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Beirut was a pleasant enough place to live. But it belied a much more complicated reality.Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had gripped onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another.Constant spats between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing.The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over”.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing their politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 100 people and injured thousands more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several-thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate and had been storing it at the port. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a fire started by a welder.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on keeping such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote one local, Dyab Abou Jahjah, who expressed the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Karl Sharro, a well-known Lebanese architect and satirist, tweeted: “Negligence, incompetence, complacency, corruption, nepotism this immoral and parasitical political class has destroyed Beirut and the whole country.”By Wednesday, the phrase hang up the nooses was trending on Twitter in Lebanon.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (the son of a previous premier), stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its free-falling economy. The country’s currency lost up to 80 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Its once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell their possessions in online markets.There was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state”. There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes on Tuesday night. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"officials long called chemicals behind blast removed beirut","story":"For years Lebanese port officials had called for the removal of dangerous chemicals stored in a waterfront warehouse that exploded in a blast that damaged homes of 300,000 Beirut residents and killed over 100 people, according to preliminary investigations on Wednesday.Tuesday’s blast was likely caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the dock since being confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014, according to Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi.The industrial chemical is commonly used as fertiliser and is not reactive on its own but it can explode when detonated by an ignition source.Reports suggested a fire started by a welding accident may have ignited fireworks, causing the stored chemicals to explode.The explosion was the most powerful in the history of Beirut, a city that lived through a 15-year civil war and is now suffering a devastating financial crisis borne of decades of corruption and economic mismanagement.The devastation came into sharper focus on Wednesday, as the death toll from the catastrophe rose to 135, with Hamad Hassan, the health minister, warning it could climb higher as dozens of people remained missing amid ongoing rescue efforts.At least 5,000 people were also injured.The UK will provide a £5 million aid package to Lebanon, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said yesterday, and Britain has offered medical workers, and search-and-rescue experts with sniffer dogs to find survivors.The Ministry of Defence confirmed that an advance party of Armed Forces personnel would be deployed to assist with the fallout.The Defence Secretary said HMS Enterprise, a survey vessel currently based in Cyprus, would be sent to help Beirut prepare to rebuild.Mr Raab said he spoke to Hassan Diab, the Lebanese prime minister, who he said promised a “full, thorough and rigorous” investigation into the blast, and accountability for those responsible.Donald Trump yesterday continued to float the idea that the blast may have been caused by a bomb, despite his defence secretary Mark Esper saying it appeared to have been an accident. Mr Trump said: How can you say accident? Somebody left some terrible explosive-type devices around perhaps... Perhaps it was an attack. I don’t think anybody can say.The blast, which caused tremors measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale, left a crater some 150 metres across on the capital’s waterfront (see map below).Around half of the city was damaged, according to Marwan Abboud, the governor of Beirut, who estimated that 300,000 people had been left homeless.The nitrates blamed for the explosion likely came from a Moldovan-flagged cargo ship that made an unscheduled maintenance stop in Beirut in 2013 en route to Mozambique from Georgia. Reports at the time said the Rhosus cargo ship was prevented from leaving port due to its poor state.Its owner declared bankruptcy soon afterwards, leaving the vessel, its cargo and its crew stranded, according to a Lebanese law firm that obtained an order to have the ship arrested on behalf of unnamed creditors.Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port\u0027s warehouses. The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal,” the firm Baroudi \u0026amp Associates wrote in a 2015 article published by shiparrested.The head of Beirut port and the head of customs both said on Wednesday that letters were sent to Lebanon’s judiciary asking for the removal of the nitrates, but no action was taken.Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV the material had been put in a warehouse on a court order, adding that they knew then the material was dangerous but not to this degree.We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why, Badri Daher, director-general of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the material six months ago warned it could blow up all of Beirut if not removed.Two documents seen by Reuters showed Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in 2016 and 2017 to request that the concerned maritime agency re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One document cited similar requests in 2014 and 2015.It is negligence, an official source familiar with the findings of early investigations told Reuters, adding that the issue of storing the material safely had come before several committees and judges and nothing was done to order the material be removed.Lebanon’s cabinet said on Wednesday that it was placing an unspecified number of port officials under house arrest while it investigated how the explosive materials came to be stored at the port for years.It also declared a two-week state of emergency in the city and approved the allocation of 100 billion Lebanese pounds (£50 million) to deal with the crisis.That sum will only be a small fraction of the amount needed for reconstruction. The disaster will have a calamitous effect on Lebanon’s already collapsing economy.The port, through which much of the country’s imported food and goods arrive, was largely flattened, and much of Beirut’s commercial district was heavily damaged.Destroyed wheat silos near the epicentre of the blast held up to 85 per cent of the country’s grain, mountains of which could be seen spilling into the sea on Wednesday.It has left the nation with less than a month’s reserves of the grain, the economy minister said on Wednesday.The scale of the tragedy prompted a court in the Netherlands to postpone its verdict in the trial of four men accused of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.The UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon was due to give a verdict in the trial this Friday, but delayed it until August 18 “out of respect for the countless victims of the devastating explosion that shook Beirut on 4 August”, according to a statement by the court on Wednesday.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands exam result fiasco coming england","story":"The furore that has broken out over Scottish examination results – exams which the children did not sit because of lockdown – and the downgrading of teacher-assessed grades is likely to be dwarfed by the uproar that will follow the publication of GCSE and A-level results for England later this month.The system for results that has been arrived at in England is deeply flawed, devised behind closed doors with a minimum of transparency. It hits the schools the Government should be most proud of – the rapidly improving “turnaround” schools that have been on a steep upward curb in recent years. It is also contrary to natural justice, imposing a life sentence on children, with no effective right of appeal.The Government faced an unprecedented situation in March when it became clear that public examinations could not happen. It was inevitable that a knee-jerk response would produce a solution with weaknesses in it. The fault lies not so much in the original concept – results based on a combination of teacher-predicted grades and the historical performance of schools – but rather in the fact that, having made its mind up, the Government refused to change the system where it clearly needed to.Much of its thinking was influenced by the proven fact that teachers tend to overestimate their pupils’ grades. To counter this, the Government decided that predicted grades from teachers would be run alongside the three-year historical performance of schools – and if the Scottish experience is anything to go by, it is the historical performance of schools that will be most listened to, not the teacher predictions.This is a major problem for schools that have been under a process of rapid improvement in the past three years. GCSE pupils who started their course at the start of that period will often have had to challenge the pre‑existing school culture to succeed. Their reward? To be marked on the performance of earlier peer groups. The current system works fairly only for those schools whose performance has been static for three years. It is also grossly unfair to year groups who are unusually gifted. In effect, the system says to pupils: “You and your school will be judged on what your school was, not what it is now.”The Government’s response to these criticisms is laughable. It claims there is an appeals process in England, but a school or a pupil cannot appeal against what they deem an unfair result. They can only appeal on the grounds that the school did not follow due process in submitting its estimates, falling prey to another dominant illness of our time, the focus on process to the detriment of outcome.The other solution proposed by the Government, that there will be “resits” in late autumn, is equally useless. The majority of pupils in UK schools have missed a massive amount of schooling since March. How are they going to be ready for public examinations by late autumn? The only pupils who will be prepared for such examinations will be those whose parents have been able to afford expensive private tuition.Yes, the Government is putting money into “catch-up” schemes, but it is impossible for them to compensate for what has been lost in the time available, however well-meaning they are. It is no secret that the closure of schools has had the greatest effect on disadvantaged pupils. The current system for examination grades punishes this same group twice over.There was a simple answer to the problems created by a system that was dominated unfairly by historical precedent, and which coped with inflated grade predictions. There is an army of examiners and school inspectors out there, including the recently retired, who could have been used to create a fair appeals system, by looking at the work on which a school’s predicted grade was based and assessing whether or not it was fair in any given case.Expensive? Many of the people I know would have given their time free of charge in the face of national crisis. Too lengthy? The appeals process after conventional public examinations takes months to complete. Too much trouble? Only if we do not value the future of our children.

They have grown so used to American B-29 bombers passing overhead, they have nicknamed them ‘B-San’ or ‘Mr B’. Like the rest of the world, they have never heard of the atom bomb. They do not know that Hiroshima has deliberately been spared conventional bombing so its devastating effects will be clear. Little Boy’s final destination is still not set. The US Targeting Committee has narrowed the possible targets down to three: Hiroshima, Kokura and Nagasaki. The ultimate decision will be chosen based on prevailing weather conditions.6th August. 00.02 For the first time, the crew of the B-29 named Enola Gay is told what weapon they will be carrying. Captain William ‘Deak’ Parsons informs them it will be the most furious explosion since creation, that it might crack the Earth’s crust. In Hiroshima, it is a clear night full of shooting stars.02.45 The Enola Gay takes off. It has been named after pilot Colonel Paul Tibbett’s “courageous red-haired mother”. In Tibbett’s pocket are cyanide capsules, one for each member of his crew, in case of capture. As the aeroplane heaves itself into the air, the crew still do not know where they are heading.04.00 Dr Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, finishes his air raid duty. There is nothing to report.06.41 Captain Parsons begins arming the warhead. He has taken it upon himself to do this en route, dismantling and reassembling Little Boy in the freezing bomb bay. Four heavily-laden B-29s have recently crashed taking off from the Tinian runway, which ends in a cliff. Little Boy weighs 9,700 lbs and required special sunken bays to be dug just to load it into the aircraft. The chance of catastrophe is too great.07.29 “The hour was early the morning still, warm, and beautiful,” Dr Hachiya noted in his diary. “Shimmering leaves, reflecting sunlight from a cloudless sky, made a pleasant contrast with shadows in my garden as I gazed absently through wife-flung doors opening to the south.”High above, the weather plane assigned to check conditions in Hiroshima ahead of the mission passes over the city. An air raid siren greets it, but it’s just Mr B making his rounds. Only now is the target set.08.14 Bombardier Thomas Ferebee on board Enola Gay spots the Aioi Hashi, a T-shaped bridge at the heart of the city. A tone warns the crew of the aircraft to brace themselves. The citizens of Hiroshima hear nothing but a distant thrum. There is no siren. The fireball is hotter than the surface of the sun. Almost everything within one mile of the centre is vaporised instantly. Winds of more than 650 miles per hour turn every shard of wood not immediately incinerated into shrapnel. One quarter of a city of 350,000 are killed instantly. The mountains that surround the city, which gave Hiroshima such pleasant weather, produce a ‘focussing effect’ for the shockwave.The bomb is a grotesque act of creation. It took some of the world’s finest and most creative minds, and $2 billion (more than £18 billion in today’s money), to bring it to life. At the moment of detonation it replaces the historic city of Hiroshima with something new. Hiroshima was known as Mizu no Miyako or the ‘City of Water’. Now it is, according to Dr Hachiya, “no longer a city but a burnt-over prairie”, a City of Fire.Naked survivors, the patterns of their clothes burned into their backs, wander dazed through the inferno, driven by an unbearable thirst. Many die in reservoirs, swimming pools and water tanks, or drown in the swift Ōta river. The outline of the sun through the dust is red. A black rain falls from the sky. Hiroshima is now, in a word repeated over and over again by survivors, “Hell.”It took J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, 15 minutes to accept the possibility of fission, then a week to sketch Little Boy on his blackboard. He explained: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”Yet at heart, Little Boy was barely more sophisticated than a medieval cannon, firing a uranium bullet down a tube into a target. The scientists were so confident the contraption would work, they never bothered to test it. The Trinity ‘gadget’ and Fat Man, the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki, were more sophisticated ‘implosion’ devices.The technology developed quickly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Massive weapons like the thermonuclear Tzar Bomba (thousands of times more powerful than Little Boy) gave way to missile defence shields like Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars, which in turn inspired smarter missiles. The creative spiral was only averted by bans and treaties that are now decaying. There are currently around 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world, down from a high of 70,000 in 1986. How does Little Boy compare to their power? Sharon Squassoni, a global security expert from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, bursts into laughter. It’s not reassuring.“There’s just no comparison, the shift in our nuclear arsenal is astounding. We have a wide range of power and capabilities. We even have bombs where you can dial in the yield before use.”Moreover, the trend towards smaller weapons designed for less indiscriminate destruction doesn’t necessarily make us safer. Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, explains:“In military circles, the overall trend over the years has been away from mass destruction to precision, reducing collateral damage. However, the argument goes that precision actually makes it more likely that we might use them.”New and ever more versatile weapons are now on the horizon, from unpredictable hypersonic delivery systems designed to zig-zag past missile shields, to high-altitude strikes that would disable our electronics and communications networks.For some, the old ways are still the best. The relative simplicity of gun-type devices like Little Boy mean they are perfect for terrorists looking to assemble their own. With the proliferation of nuclear states and lax security in countries of the former Soviet Union, getting fissile material is less a problem than you might think. One Russian prosecutor in a case involving the theft of uranium noted that potatoes were guarded better. There is no reason why a modern-day remake of Little Boy would be any less powerful than the original, says Squassoni. “Of course it would be as powerful as Hiroshima. Little Boy was 15 kilotons – that’s a pretty small bomb.”The hard part has already been done. Creating the bomb was difficult. Recreating it isn’t.In the days afterwards, the explosion is named the ‘pikadon’ by survivors: “flash–bang”. However, those closest to the epicentre insist on calling it simply ‘pika’. They do not remember the boom, only the flare then an eerie silence, a moment of time caught in light like a camera flash.“I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit,” wrote Dr Hachiya.The atomic bomb uses light as a weapon. It converts matter into energy at the speed of light, and some of its designers had suggested sounding a “super powerful siren” before detonation, to blind anyone who looked up and happened to catch sight of the flash. The survivors were left with an unforgettable image.“That beautiful cloud! Its beauty defies description,” recalled a friend of Dr Hachiya. “I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life!”The doctor noted that “it was at the moment of the birth of this cloud, with its ever-changing colour, that Hiroshima was wiped out. It was at this moment that Hiroshima city, the culmination of many years\u0027 work, disappeared with her good citizens into the beautiful sky.”The ‘mushroom cloud’ became the bomb’s own trademark. It had to be seen to be feared. Some Manhattan Project scientists had wanted to stage demonstrations of the weapon for Japanese generals to convince them to surrender, rather than a live bombing. Hiroshima was selected partly because the damage would be “sufficiently spectacular…when publicity on it is released.” This wasn’t just an act of war, it was a media event. “There stood the Enola Gay, bathed in floodlights like the star of a Hollywood movie,” Colonel Tibbetts recalled about boarding the plane. “For the next 20 minutes we were put through a photo routine to which none of us were accustomed.” As they returned to base, tail gunner Bob Caron snapped a picture of the cloud that sprouted behind them. His would be the only official photographs successfully developed from the mission. He wrote to his mother, asking her to collect press clippings for their scrap book.The view was different from the ground.“Many times I tried to trip the shutter release but the victim would ask for pity,” one Japanese photographer said about touring the aftermath. “It was too cruel, too inhuman to ignore their pleadings.”“If I had known it was an atom bomb, I don’t think I would have ever tried taking pictures.”The strike soon developed into an information war. Initial official reports to the Japanese people were that the US had deployed a new, ‘special bomb’, but the damage was minimal. In Hiroshima, what we would now call ‘fake news’ proliferated among the survivors. Some heard that the city would be uninhabitable for 75 years. There were rumours that Japan had secretly developed its own ‘special’ bombs, and had destroyed Los Angeles among other American cities.American wanted the truth to be known, at least for now. Leaflets were dropped on potential further targets featuring Caron’s snapshot. It noted that “the atomic bomb’s horrendous destructive power can be understood by viewing this photo.” An earlier leaflet dropped on Hiroshima had warned civilians that although the targets were military, “unfortunately, bombs have no eyes.”Seventy-five years later the atomic information war is still raging, but has moved from leaflets to social media. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warns of a general poisoning of our ‘information ecosphere’, including “sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda” and leaders throwing doubt on scientists and “national institutions that have historically provided societal stability and cohesion.” The hacking of Twitter in July, in which accounts including American Democratic nominee Joe Biden sent out spam messages, had dark implications. President Trump, apparently not hacked, once tweeted that he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim Jong Un.“I don’t think nuclear war could be started by hacking into Twitter,” says Squassoni, “but when you have the leaders of countries issuing nuclear threats on it, that’s a serious development.”Hiroshima’s after-image faded into the culture of the atomic 20th Century, the ultimate symbol of danger and progress. Children could draw the cloud\u0027s silhouette, like Mickey Mouse. It influenced everything from the nuclear-powered rage of Godzilla to the bikini swimsuit, named for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Meanwhile, Hiroshima and its people found themselves transformed into silent symbols. The mushroom cloud. The ruined dome. Kengo Nikawa’s pocket watch, stuck forever at 8.15. And for some, just their shadow, burned into the wall behind them, like a photo negative.9th August 1945. It is a cloudy day in Nagasaki. 40,000 people are blasted into memory. The original target for Fat Man, the second and so far final nuclear bomb used in warfare, was Kokura. It is skipped over due to a thick hanging fog.Meanwhile, Hiroshima is still in the shadow of the first bombing, with many survivors now living in Dr Hachiya’s hospital. A horse, burned and blind, ambles around its garden, eating the leaves of a potato patch the doctor had planted.Eleven days after the blast, more baffling symptoms become evident. People who were relatively unscathed develop speckles on their skin, then die. Another mystery: epilation.“Falling hair! This was an unusual symptom, but undeniable. Unconsciously, I grabbed some of my hair and pulled. I did not have much hair in the first place, but the amount that came out made me feel sick,” wrote Dr Hachiya.No one knows what is happening. They are in the dark.“The idea was to explode the damned thing,” recalled Hymer Friedell, who oversaw biomedical research at the Manhattan Project and later toured Hiroshima. “We weren\u0027t terribly concerned with the radiation”The world experts on the subject were now those who lived through it. Dr Hachiya noted that the closer the survivors were to the centre of the blast, the more likely they were to develop these novel symptoms, placing each patient on a map. The value of this data did not go unnoticed.Navy Secretary James Forrestal told President Truman that survivors would offer “a unique opportunity for the study of the medical and biological effects of radiation which is of utmost importance to the United States.” A legion of international scientists descended on Japan and the survivors. Reports from local doctors were collected and expanded upon. The survivors were to be studied, not necessarily treated. A cure was never an option.Many ‘hibakusha’, as they came to be known, found themselves outcasts. Their stories were censored by the American occupation, while they were shunned by society at large.“Every survivor has had a different experience,” says Takuo Takigawa, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “Some people didn’t want to go near them because they were ‘infected’. With others, there was a thought that they would soon die anyway.”Hibakusha were banned from public baths, for fear of contaminating the water. People refused to employ them, and certainly wouldn\u0027t marry one. The spectre of radiation exposure transformed into the idea that they were inherently sullied. Some chose to never have children.“At that time in Japan any physical deformation or injury was heavily shunned,” says Barak Kushner, professor of East Asian history at Cambridge. However, the shame extended even to those without visible injuries. “In some ways they are symbols of Japan’s failure and defeat, and of the poverty to which Japan has sunk, as it’s not able to help them. They don’t get specific compensation until years later.”Meanwhile, studies moved from the immediate aftermath to the long term. By 1950, 130,000 survivors were enrolled in what is known as the ‘Life Span Study’. It precisely surveyed where each survivor was standing relative to the blast, just as Dr Hachiya had done. Surviving hibakusha have reported for check ups right up to today.The study forms the world’s largest bank of knowledge on the effect of radiation on the human body. It is so thorough that in 1982, scientists at the Los Alamos National Lab built a replica of Little Boy – including the uranium – to better understand its findings. It helped develop safe medical uses for radiation, like CAT scans and X-rays. Nasa consulted it to help protect astronauts from cosmic radiation. Now the survey is focussing on the next generation, tracking possible effects on survivors’ children.“The rainy season officially ended yesterday,” Takigawa chuckles. “Today is a very sunny day in Hiroshima.”It is difficult to put a final number on the number killed by the attacks in 1945, given the confusion afterwards and the malignant effects of radiation, but estimates suggest more than 200,000.The rumours that Hiroshima would be uninhabitable for 75 years proved false. Both it and Nagasaki are now thriving. In 1949, a law ordered that Hiroshima be rebuilt as a “Peace Memorial City, a symbol of the ideal of making lasting peace a reality.” Despite fears over radiation, many citizens chose to stay and rebuild the city they loved. Before the war it had a population of around 350,000. Now it’s more than 2 million. The ruin of the industrial museum remains preserved at the centre, the dome cracked and open to the sky.Once forgotten and ignored by the world at large, the hibakusha became figureheads for peace movements worldwide. The Memorial Museum was established at least partly to remind the world that the victims are people, not just symbols.“The hibakusha saw it as a mission of sorts, to tell their story,” says Takigawa. “The reality of what happened, the feelings and memory, must be passed on, so people can feel the horrors of that event themselves.”The threat has not passed, for any of us. Every year since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, first established by former Manhattan Project workers, set their ‘Doomsday Clock’ to indicate how near we are to annihilation. This year it ticked to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. They point to the breakdown of arms control treaties a general worsening of relations between the great powers and climate change as contributing factors.“The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape,” the Bulletin warned. “Any belief that the threat of nuclear war has been vanquished is a mirage.”Moreover, nuclear weapons now have to compete with a wide variety of impending disasters.“They’ve fallen out of the public consciousness, but polling 20 somethings shows they actually believe they will be used in the coming decades. The younger generation is very fatalistic. However, nuclear weapons don\u0027t rise to the top of the agenda for them, whereas climate really does,” says Squassoni.After 75 years, the light from that blast has faded in the public consciousness. Simply put, we are no longer afraid of the atom bomb. Then again, neither were the people of Hiroshima.Few people live in constant fear of the newer threats Seth Baum specialises in, from artificial intelligence to designer viruses that would make coronavirus balk. They’re threats most will never have imagined, right up until the point they happen.“The last time that happened was the September 11 terrorist attack, which was low-tech, but it caught us off guard and changed how we think about the world,” says Baum. “So did coronavirus.”Takigawa says Hiroshima takes pride in teaching the world a lesson about peace, even though it had to suffer terribly for it. “There may be other ways of learning this lesson, but I can’t think of any,” he notes. In 2016, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit the site of the bombing. He gave a touching speech, paying tributes to the hibakusha and noting that “the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.” It’s another admirable lesson, just one of many we’ve learned from Hiroshima and Nagaski: technologically, medically, politically and philosophically.Yet, fundamentally, they’re not lessons the people of Hiroshima needed to learn on 6 August 1945. We can learn from the dead. They can’t learn by dying. All they would ever know is one simple fact: that, in Obama’s words, “on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky, and the world was changed.”We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swedens economy outperforms european countries pandemic","story":"Sweden\u0027s economy has fared better during the peak three months of the coronavirus pandemic than the European average, the country\u0027s statistics agency has reported, adding to growing evidence that the decision to avoid a full lockdown is paying economic idends. The country\u0027s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 8.6 per cent in April and June, compared to the preceding three months, Statistics Sweden reported. The average drop of the ten member states who have so far submitted flash estimates for the three months is 11.9 per cent, the EU\u0027s statistics agency reported last week. Spain, France and Italy did still worse, with their economies contracting by 18.5, 13.8, and 12.4 percent respectively.   This is the biggest quarterly drop for Sweden since 1980, meaning the country has taken a bigger hit than in either its 1990s financial crisis or in the 2008 banking crash. Magdalena Andersson, the finance minister, nonetheless welcomed the figures at a press conference following the announcement.   It\u0027s a historic fall, but, at the same time, less than in many other countries, and actually less than I was expecting back in June, she said. Sweden kept open primary and lower secondary schools, kindergartens, restaurants, bars offices and shops throughout the pandemic, although both the government and the Public Health Agency have insisted this was not motivated by a wish to protect the economy.Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at the country\u0027s SEB Bank, said that the official figures confirmed trends his analysts had been seeing for some time.We could see that we had a substantial slowdown, but not of the same magnitude as we saw for other countries, and today we saw that it was correct to say, \u0027yes, Sweden will be affected, but the impact should be a bit less\u0027.He said there were three reasons for the milder hit.The first is this flexible attitude to lockdowns, the second is that we have a different composition to our economy - we\u0027re not very dependent on tourism - and the final reason is that the Nordic countries have a better digital infrastructure, which means we can move the economy into this digital world.Sweden\u0027s neighbours Denmark and Norway, which have yet to publish GDP figures for the second quarter, both imposed much more thoroughgoing lockdowns, but are, according to many forecasts, still expected to see a slightly lower fall in GDP than Sweden, largely because of Sweden\u0027s substantial iron ore, steel and forestry industries. A succession of Swedish companies have over the past three weeks reported better profits for the second quarter than expected, while Handelsbanken, which serves many small businesses in the country, has said the number of bankruptcies and bad loans it is seeing remains low.Mr Bergqvist said Swedish business leaders he spoke to were optimistic. They are saying that they are surprised by the quick recovery in demand, he said. We still have unutilised resources in the Swedish economy, but we have started the recovery, that is very obvious. The big question right now is how strong this recovery is and also, whether it is sustainable. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us live paradise have no choice share","story":"I completely understand why the world, his wife, his camper van and his labradoodle are heading for the sea and countryside after being Covided up for months. I moved to the coast seven years ago and quickly realised that the price we pay for living, quietly, in paradise for most of the year is that in summer we have to share it with the visitors. They bring a busy, buzzy energy and pour money into the local economy.I’m not a Nimby – indeed, I’m actually part of the tourist industry. As a volunteer tour guide for Southwold Lighthouse, I love to hear the excited “Wow!” as visitors finally get to the top. This year, the lighthouse is closed and the village fête has been cancelled for the first time since the war, yet we have more tourists than ever. A few weeks ago, as lockdown eased, beaches suddenly overflowed, roads were jammed with illegally parked cars and litter rained down on beauty spots like confetti – all of which prompted the anxious question: “If everyone who normally goes abroad this year staycations at home, what effect will that have on our tourist towns and coastal village destinations?”Now we know. The seaside village of Salcombe in Devon has increased its population by 1,000 per cent, and the mayor spoke this week more in sorrow than in anger: “Everybody is exhausted and overwhelmed. The businesses need the customers, but we would like a little respect for the town we love.”What does that mean? I think we all know. It’s summed up by the bestselling T-shirt, which reads: “Be Kind”. But we’re not always kind, are we? There’s a tension, a resentment, a frenetic bolshiness, from some visitors and locals. I admit I’m upset when our sand dunes are used as lavatories (even though the public lavatories are open) and the “dog waste” bins are crammed with disposable barbecues, bottles, nappies – and once even a mattress.And I turn into a “furious flagger” when car drivers seem to be under the bizarre impression that our village street is the M25, rather than a pavement-free thoroughfare filled with children, dogs, horses and cyclists for which the speed limit is officially a constipated snail’s pace. Let’s face it, we’re all on edge. We’ve been scared, confused and bored for months, veering between feeling gung-ho and guarded. We’ve locked down, ventured out, rushed back in again, washed our hands until they feel as silky as a Brillo pad, spent hours trying to get a refund on flights and holidays – or an online food delivery slot. We’ve danced the Food Aisle Fandago, as we dip and swerve round each other to get to the sliced ham or the curly kale. In our local Co-op we’ve had a number of “Maskgate” confrontations, diffused by the wonderfully patient staff. If locals seem unwelcoming and visitors tetchy, it’s because we’ve all been traumatised for months. And it’s not over. We’re all still scared – and when we’re frightened we tend to overreact.So, if you’re staycationing, let me say we want you to come and have a lovely time here. More than that, we need you to come, for the sake of our small businesses. But as a high percentage of our population are older and sometimes vulnerable, we would just ask that you tread softly and safely, with patience, good humour – and kindness. In return, we’ll be kind to you – unless you come into the Co-op without a mask.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh accent among attractive world due bond effect survey","story":"Yesh, it is. The Edinburgh accent has been voted among the most attractive in the world thanks to “The Bond Effect”- courtesy of Sir Sean Connery, a survey has found.Researchers asked 1000 Britons to listen to voice recordings spoken in 20 dialects and rank them on a scale of 1 to 5 based on various positive traits, including attractiveness.Born in Fountainbridge, just west of Edinburgh city centre, Sir Sean, 89, played James Bond in the first five films of the spy series, starting with Dr.No in 1962.His timbre is now recognised across all age groups as one of coolness, helping to cast the Scottish capital\u0027s dialect in a similarly smooth light internationally, according to researchers.Commenting on the findings, Rachael Lloyd, a relationship expert at eharmony, told The Daily : “No doubt, people mentally heard the phrase “Bond, James Bond” in Sean Connery\u0027s famous burr as they responded.“A major reason for this popularity is that he is someone who is familiar to all age groups, who know him as the suave, sophisticated \u0027original\u0027 Bond and as such, link the accent to these qualities. The fact that these universal associations stand the test of time have a really significant impact on how people perceive others with the same accent.”In the study, participants listened to the same 40 voice recordings read by actors in different accents, before ranking the clips for traits such as charm, good humour and intelligence.The sentence read: “In Britain we can expect rain at any time of the year. While winter is wetter than summer, seasonal differences in rainfall are very small.”Received pronunciation was seen as the most attractive accent with an average score of 3.34, due to its association with intelligence, followed by the New Zealand accent on 3.06, and Edinburgh was third at 2.91.In contrast, the Cornish dialect ranked last for attractiveness, with a score of 2.28, although it was rated highly in relation to a good sense of humour.But the distinctive Celtic twang only marginally lost out to Spanish and French, which came 18th and 19th respectively.Researchers said views on accents are largely shaped by perceptions of celebrities speaking with them on TV and in films.The study noted that just under a quarter of people surveyed felt more positively about the Geordie dialect because of Ant and Dec\u0027s likeable on-screen personalities.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6th august 2020","story":"Two massive explosions devastated the port of the capital town.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A more effective test and trace system is needed to make schools and parents feel more confident as students return in September, headteachers have told The Independent following a recent study into the programme. Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Progress is accelerating.Future versions of the Starship spacecraft could hold up to 100 people, with the most optimistic predictions for launch suggesting missions could commence as early as 2024. Earlier this year, Musk revealed that SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Starship rockets travelling between Earth, the moon and Mars.The spacecraft facilities will also be used to launch passengers travelling at hypersonic speeds around Earth.The technology billionaire has frequently spoken about his desire to make humanity a multi-planetary species, and even hopes to travel to Mars in his lifetime.Speaking at a satellite conference in March, Musk said he feared progress towards this goal was happening at too slow a pace.We\u0027ve got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars, he said.Created with Sketch.

The Germans believed that royal navy ers had entered the vessel and had recovered crucial intelligence information, including a detailed map of German minefields.However, the University of Southampton investigation, led by archaeologist Dr Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz, has now assessed the wreck’s approximate depth in November 1917 (48-51 metres) – which suggests that er penetration of the vessel was extremely unlikely.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMystery of missing Second World War submarine solved after 75 yearsHistorical accounts reveal that HMS P57 spent several days dropping depth charges on the wreck.It’s likely that this was done precisely because it was not possible to physically gain entry to the sunken U-boat. The only way to recover intelligence information was therefore to repeatedly depth charge her in the hope that additional holes in the vessel could be created – and that, as a result, important documents might then float to the surface.Although there are no surviving British records of any such intelligence-gathering coup, senior German naval officials did know about it (although they wrongly assumed that the crucial papers had been recovered by royal navy ers – rather than as floating debris).But how did they know? German historians, working in collaboration with the University of Southampton, are now planning to search the German archives to try to find an answer.It is conceivable that the German navy had obtained the information by listening to royal navy wartime radio communications – or they may have somehow obtained it from British naval sources after the war.During the First World War, it was notoriously difficult to sink German U-boats. However, in late 1917 and 1918, the royal navy developed a number of techniques to reduce the impact of German submarines and to increase the number being sunk.To reduce the German U-boat kill rates, they introduced the convoy system for UK merchant vessels – and to increase British success in destroying German U-boats, they fitted strengthened bows to royal navy anti-submarine vessels (to enable them to ram U-boats) and they developed the first effective depth charges.Both new technologies were employed in the sinking of UC47.And the repeated depth charge attacks on the sunken German submarine seems to have enabled the British to gain crucial intelligence information that would in turn have enabled them to locate and clear the mines that UC47, had laid (thus saving many UK merchant vessels from destruction).The Germans primarily used their U-boats to damage the UK’s war effort – by seeking to blockade Britain and by trying to prevent the UK transporting vital coal, steel, timber and cement (much of which had to be transported from northern Britain to southern Britain by coastal cargo vessels).It was in the second half of 1917 that the royal navy began to defeat the U-boat threat – and the sinking of UC 47 was an important part of that process – particularly so because that particular submarine was one of the most effective in the German navy. Prior to its sinking, it had sunk 56 UK and allied ships in just 13 months.UC47’s end came on 18 November, 1917. All 26 of her crew went down with her. The historical record shows that, through sheer chance, the British patrol boat spotted the German U-boat about 200 yards away, approximately one hour before sunrise. Within 15 seconds, the royal navy vessel launched a devastating surprise attack on the German submarine by ramming her. The impact, at 17 knots, tore through the German vessel’s hull, causing her to start filling up with water. The British vessel then dropped two depth charges on the stricken sub – and quickly marked the position with a buoy.Orkney’s shipwreck graveyard is bursting with lifeA third depth charge was then dropped on the sunken U-boat – and a fourth was targeted at the German vessel as she lay on the seabed at 4pm on 19 November. Large amounts of oil and air bubbles continuously rose from  the wreck to the surface. HMS P57 remained at the attack site for around three whole days. Even as late as 20 November, two days after the attack, personnel on board the British vessel saw very large air bubbles rising to the surface – so there were obviously still sizeable pockets of air in the sunken sub as she languished on the sea floor.The two unmanned ultra-high-tech modern submarines used in the University of Southampton investigation of the German U-boat are operated by the Swedish offshore survey company, MMT – and owned by the Norwegian firm, Reach Subsea. The investigation into the wreck is being carried out by the university’s Centre for Maritime Archaeology, as part of that centre’s Offshore Archaeological Research programme.“As our investigation continues, we hope to progressively shed more light on this long-forgotten deadly North Sea drama,” said the project’s historical adviser, Stephen Fisher.University of Southampton\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For almost seven years more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been left in a warehouse Beirut’s portside, without adequate safety precautions, and no agreement on what to do with the potentially hugely lethal consignment.The authorities were fully aware of the risk: they had been writing to each other over the years, discussing various options. But nothing was done, the condition of the material in warehouse “hangar 12” continued to deteriorate, and then came the devastating explosion killing more than a hundred people and injuring 4,000 – a blast so powerful that it was felt in Cyprus 120 miles away.President Michel Aoun declared a three-day mourning period, and said the government will release £ 50.5m in emergency funding.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe called the failure to deal with ammonium nitrate “unacceptable” and pledged the “harshest punishment” for those responsible.Lebanon’s cabinet announced later on Wednesday it would be placing all of Beirut’s port officials who were responsible for storage and security since 2014 under house arrest.Lebanon declares state of emergency over Beirut explosion – updatesThere will also be an investigation into what happened, but the denouement of that “harshest punishment” is likely to take a long time. A verdict is expected this week by a UN-backed court into the killing of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri – 15 years after his death.The ammonium nitrate, a substance which can be used to make bombs as well as for commercial use such as fertiliser and mining explosives, had arrived in Beirut in September 2013 on board Russian-owned Moldovan-flagged ship the Rhosus, bound for Beira in Mozambique from Batumi in Georgia.It had docked in Beirut after reporting engine trouble. Lebanese officials prevented the ship from continuing its journey citing safety concerns by port state control officers. Most of the Ukrainian crew were repatriated on the grounds that they were in “imminent danger” due to the material on board. The vessel was eventually abandoned by its owners.The Lebanese authorities impounded the cargo and put it in the hangar, a large structure which faces the highway at the main entrance to the capital.There the material stayed for months. Then, leaked official documents show, the then-director of customs, Shafik Merhi, sent a letter to the “urgent matters judge” pointing the need to decide what to do with it. The name of the judge is not known.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailCustoms officials, according to these records circulating in Lebanon, sent at least five more letters between 5 December 2014 and 27 October 2017 stressing the need for the ammonium nitrate to be moved. The options proposed were exporting the material, selling it to the privately owned Lebanese Explosives Company, or asking the army to collect it.One letter sent in 2016 said: “In view of the serious danger of keeping these goods in the hangar in unsuitable climatic conditions, we reaffirm our request to please request the marine agency to re-export these goods immediately to preserve the safety of the port and those working on it or to look into agreeing to sell this amount” to the Lebanese Explosives Company.The letter recorded that there had been no replies from judges to previous requests. There was no reply to this letter either.A year later, in October 2017, a new customs director, Badri Daher, sent another letter to a judge asking for a decision in view of “the danger ... of leaving these goods in the place they are, and to those working there.”The Reuters news agency reported that the issue of storing the material had come before several committees and judges and “nothing was done”. It also stated that a team that inspected the cargo six months ago warned that it could “blow up all of Beirut” if not removed.Officials said a fire appears to have started at hangar 9 and spread to hangar 12 detonating the ammonium nitrate. The substance, however, is not an explosive by itself, but an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire and making it rage faster and further.Beirut port officials to be put under house arrest following blastsTimeline of events leading up to Beirut explosionsBeirut explosion: Before and after pictures show extent of damagePriest dodges falling rubble as Beirut explosion hits during massPollutants would also add to the flames. “That’s what may have happened, the ammonium nitrate got something added to it accidentally, possibly oil or some other flammable compound. Ammonium nitrate smoke is more yellow, this is rather red.  An investigation would ascertain if that is the case and where contamination took place,” said Robert Emerson, a British security analyst.Ammonium nitrate has been used in explosive devices by military forces in many countries. It has also been used in several terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 by right-wing extremists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, which destroyed a federal building and killed 168 people.Donald Trump told reporters at the White House: “It would seem like it was based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a – some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event... They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.”But there has not been any evidence to suggest that the explosion was a deliberate attack – something defence officials told several American media outlets following the president’s comments.The Pentagon refused to comment on Mr Trump’s claims, referring it back to the White House. Defence officials told several American media outlets that there was no evidence that the explosion was a deliberate attack.

The social media expert says: Adele posing with arguably one of the most iconic girl groups of all time shows shes totally comfortable among these sexy s legends, and screams of independence and girl power!’ This is clearly a common theme post break-up.”The psychologist says: Fame brought the Spice Girls some insecurities which they have now conquered, like Adele.The V for victory sign is an acknowledgement of perhaps overcoming obstacles and freedom and liberation at last.The first real glimpse of the stars svelte new figure came courtesy of a fan, who bumped into her on a beach in the Caribbean resort of Anguilla in January.The newly single star was on a mates holiday with Harry Styles and James Corden, as well as son Angelo.The psychologist says: The picture of Adele alone indicates a freshness.Her body posture is relaxed and confident - revealing more of her body than before.The social media expert says: Yet another picture of Adele with a radiating smile is amazing to see, and clearly shows how content she is.I’m sure it’s no coincidence that there are so many images of her looking happy on her own.”There had been hints of weight loss before the singers birthday, in theCaribbean beach shot and at the Oscars a month later.But it was the birthday snap she posted in May, to thank her fans for their kind wishes, which broke the internet.The newly slim singer, who has dropped a huge seven stone by following a strict diet and working out with a personal trainer, posed outside her house in a black mini-dress and looked completely unrecognisable. The stylist says: Adeles style has shted from more of a formal look, with glamorous, long sweeping gowns, to shorter, more figure-hugging dresses.Each outfit - before and after her weight change - has been carefully selected to suit her shape and colour tone.The psychologist says: This is a stunning picture of Adele where she looks younger with longer hair, happier, with a completely dferent style of dress.  She no longer hides her body, but shows of her slimmer one with great pins.  It says this is a dferent and more confident me.The social media expert says: If social media is good for anything it is shouting about body positivity and Adele is no dferent, despite her normally-subdued social media output. The nature of the pictures and the increase in her social media activity is testament to how clearly proud Adele is of her new look, which will no doubt increase her popularity, as body-confident celebrities are often lauded by the public.”The Skyfall singer looked every inch the Bond girl as she celebrated her birthday with pal Nicole Richie in May.Although taken around the same time, the sexy, smouldering look, glamorous up do and figure-hugging mini were a stark contrast to the smiling girl-next-door in the weight loss reveal pic.The social media expert says: “Single le may have been just the tonic to help Adele begin to love herself again, and her pictures show – or at least portray – that she is happy without her ex.Posting pictures of how glowing and healthy you are following a break-up is a sure-fire way to show that you are prospering.The psychologist says: A split can often result in major weight loss or gain, and in Adele’s case it has had a positive impact.It has boosted her self-image and self-esteem and transformed this natural beauty into an exotic, sexy superstar. To match her weight loss, the singer has also changed her wardrobe from long dresses to figure-hugging dresses. She oozes sexuality and looks at peace with herself – bringing more adoration from her fans.Like proud slimmers when they climb into an oversized pair of their old trousers, Adele couldnt resist digging out her iconic beaded Glastonbury dress during a lockdown reshowing of her set.The post was a timely reminder of how much weight she had managed to lose since that  gig.The stylist says: By wearing the outfit she wore to perform at Glastonbury, I think the message to her fans is that shes still the same talented and likeable person they fell in love with all those years ago.Shes confident and happy, always looks immaculate - and women will always love her.The psychologist says: Donning an iconic dress from the past is a reminder of what she was... but now where is heading.  Divorce for anyone is traumatic and depressing, but for Adele it spelt a change from a mental and physical perspective and shes confronting both aspects head-on.Fans of the Chasing Pavements star are used to seeing her glammed up to the nines, with heavy eye make-up and fabulous clothes.So this recent snap of her relaxing at home in her sweatpants and T-shirt, make-up free, was a refreshing insight into the off-duty Adele.The caption on the picture - five ciders in - was a typically down to earth message that shes still one of us. The psychologist says: Again, Adele is revealing her self-assurance.This totally natural look and pose is revealing... no props, just a picture of some at ease with herself.The singers latest post showcased a new curly style and a slap-free face, as she posed in front of artwork for Beyonces album Black is King.The psychologist says: This shows Adele with a natural angelic face.She is going back to reality and naturalness revealing a new confidence in herself and shes stripped herself of all articial aid of make-up.  How many of us would go without make-up   This picture certainly shows that Adele is in a dferent mode in her le.  And its a change for the good.The social media expert says: While the frequent and dramatic hair changes could be down to something as simple as playing with styles or even lockdown boredom, this sort of thing is common in break-ups, particularly when it comes to posting on social media. Hair colour is something you have complete control over, so to change it dramatically shows that you have that control. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could do this either by denying early release for his drug dealing sentence or by insisting he remains in custody until the conclusion of the rape case appeals process.The widow raped by Christian B feared he would kill her during a horric -minute ordeal in Portugal in .The American woman was beaten with a razor-sharp sword after the fiend broke into her villa.Christian B, , was convicted and sentenced for her rape in December  -  years after the brutal attack which devastated her so much she fled to the US.A seven-year jail term for the rape in Praia da Luz is due to kick in at the end of him serving time for drugs trafficking, in January next year.But, his lawyers had argued that it was a breach of international law to put him on trial for the rape.His lawyer, Friedrich Fulscher appeared before a  of judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in July demanding he be freed on a technicality.Fulscher argued it was unconstitutional that Christian had been tried for the rape because it breached international law.And today, an adviser to Europes top court confirmed that German authorities failed to follow correct procedures when they extradited Christian from Italy for a rape charge, says Reuters.He had been extradited to Germany from Italy under the international warrant in .Christian B, who lived in Portugals Algarve region when three-year-old Madeleine vanished from her bedroom in , had challenged the validity of the warrant issued by Germany because it cited a drugs conviction- but not the  rape charge.He is already due for parole from Kiel prison after being given time off for good behaviour from a -month sentence imposed by a German court in .The convicted rapist and paedo applied for early release from his -month drugs trafficking sentence in June, and was eligible after serving two-thirds of his sentence.German authorities were required to get the consent of the Italian authorities to carry out their proceedings lawfully, Advocate General Michal Bobek at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the EU said in a non-binding opinion.Portuguese police had failed to crack the rape case at the time, but Christian B was arrested  years later when two pals reported him after finding disturbing films in his home.They said the films, which had never been found until then, showed him raping and torturing his elderly victim.DNA sample taken from a hair at the scene helped convict him and he was jailed for seven years last December.He also bound, gagged and tortured her during the sex attack and she told police: “I feared I was going to die.”The battered and bruised victim was so traumatised she gave up her Portuguese retirement home and fled to the US.Evil Christian B escaped justice for  years before he was nailed by DNA evidence taken from a hair at the scene.The woman spent two days with investigators recounting her ordeal in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in September  — two years before \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club complex in the same Algarve resort.A female FBI agent interviewed the widow about the attack on behalf of Portuguese police.Official documents tell how she failed to notice balaclava-clad fiend slipping into her home because she was gripped by TV news about Hurricane Katrina.She told the agent: “I went to the study. I was grabbed by a very strong and tall man by the neck in the dark and pulled up the five stone stairs into the bedroom.“I was briefly able to recognise a masked figure.“Dark eyes looked out of slits and he had held a long, curved kne, which looked like a sabre.“He gagged me, tied my arms behind my back and then, as I later found out, put bedclothes and other material on the windows so no one could look inside.“I remember thinking, ‘I hope he won’t kill me. “It lasted about  minutes and I got the feeling he enjoyed it.“I insulted him and called him a son of a b**** and an a*******.“The rape then happened almost casually, ashe had already lost interest.“Finally, in basic Portuguese, he asked me where I had my money, saying, ‘Onde dinheiro ’, “He removed the gag because he realised that otherwise I could not answer and loosened the shackles.“He was sawing back and forth with his kne.“He said he was careful not to hurt me, which made me a little calmer, as I had previously been afraid that he would kill me after I initially saw the kne. I had feared for my le.He led me to the bathroom and ordered me, ‘No call police’. It changed my whole le and led to me moving back to the United States.”Christian B fled the house and a short time later the woman, who had suffered cuts and bruises all over her body, raised the alarm with a neighbour.She later discovered her attacker had also stolen her Apple iBook laptop, worth about £,.The woman and her husband had moved to Portugal on their retirement because they had grown to love the area so much on holiday, but he had died a few years later.The widow stayed on but struggled to cope following the attack.She was unable to sleep unless she had the light on and put up heavy blinds on the house, which was on a path to a beach, so no one could see in.Within a few months she sold up and moved back to Pasadena, Calornia, because she didn’t feel safe.Christian B is currently serving a sentence for drug offences in a German jail, having appealed against the rape conviction.He was only  when he moved to the Portugal with his then-girlfriend in .He had reportedly left his homeland to flee a prison sentence at the time.Christian B spent  years living in the Algarve, and was based in a ramshackle farmhouse in hills overlooking Praia and just a short drive from the Ocean Club.His reported total of  previous convictions also includes theft and forging documents.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There will be people who refuse to pay.”Four and a half million pensioners will be sent a -page letter and application form when then their licence expires.Each household should submit photocopies of their documents from the Department for Work and Pensions or the Pension Service to prove that they are in receipt of pension credit.A bank statement will also be acceptedthey don’t have access to a photocopier.The BBC agreed to make over-s exempt from the fee back in  after an agreement was hammered out with the Government.The subsidy will continue to be offered to over-s on pension credit – which includes those on a weekly income below £. and couples on less than £..But Corporation bosses have since said the BBC cannot afford to continue the universal entitlement, which would hit programmes and services.The move has been slammed by campaigners and politicians with Boris Johnson saying the Beeb has made the “wrong decision”.An official spokesman for the PM said last month: We recognise the value of free TV licences for over-s and believe that they should be funded by the BBC.Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said it was a “sad day” for elderly Brits who feel like they are being “let down” by the government and the BBC.She said that more than half a million of the poorest pensioners will still have to pay for a licence, cut spending on other essentials like food or heating, give up TV altogether or keep watching without a licence, in breach of the law because they still do not qualy for pension credit.It is deplorable that any older person should have to make such a horrible choice.”However, the BBC said maintaining the subsidy would cost £million a year and would lead to the closure of BBC Two as well as other channels and radio station.A spokeswoman said: It was the Government that ended funding for over-s TV licences and that the BBC has made the fairest decision possible to support the poorest, oldest pensioners.She added: Critically, it isnt the BBC making judgments about poverty - the Government sets and controls pension credit.The decision to start the new scheme in August has not been easy but delaying the introduction has cost the BBC over £ million and we cannot afford to delay any further.Continuing with the Government scheme would have cost £ million a year and rising and would have meant the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio  Live, and a number of local radio stations.These closures would profoundly damage the BBC for everyone, especially older people who use the BBC the most.A Department for Digital, Culture, Media  Sport spokesperson said: We are bitterly disappointed by the BBCs decision not to extend the over  licence fee concession beyond August.The BBC remains responsible for the concession and for setting out what those affected will now need to do. It must now look urgently at how it can use its substantial licence fee income to deliver for audiences of all ages, including by making efficiencies.The DCMS says the Government agreed a deal with the BBC in , which the director-general said provided financial stability.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rule not to travel further than five miles away from your home has also been reinstated in the Aberdeen City Council area and residents have been told not visit each other in houses.Single adult households who have joined up in a support bubble with another household can continue to visit. Ms Sturgeon also told people not to travel to Aberdeen.It comes just days after the Queen arrived in Scotland to spend time at her Balmoral estate over the summer.Her Majesty is staying around  miles outside of Aberdeen, and flew into the citys airport from RAF Northolt.The new rules in Aberdeen are far tougher than local lockdowns in Greater Manchester and parts of northern England - where people are no longer allowed to visit indoors, but can still head to the pub.There were  new cases of the virus Scotland wide. Nicola Sturgeon announced today: She said this lunchtime: So, a precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now - dficult though that undoubtedly is - in order to try and contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.This high number of cases certainly heightens our concern that we are dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may involve some community transmission.Now, the main link identied in this cluster has been the Hawthorn Bar in Aberdeen city centre, however more detailed analysis by NHS Grampian and Test  Protect has shown that this one venue does not account for all of the positive cases.The First Minister said changes will be reviewed every seven days starting next Wednesday when she hopes the restrictions could be removed either entirely or partially. Staff suddenly out of work will be able to be re-furloughed under the job retention scheme. The harsh restrictions could be extended to parts of Aberdeenshirethey need to be, Ms Sturgeon said.She added that the outbreak was a sharp reminder of what happenspeople let their guard drop and start behind like normal again. She said:should serve as a warning to all of us. It comes days before all kids are set to go back to school in Scotland from August .Ms Sturgeon said she took the decision after being struck by comments from the Childrens Commissioner for England Anne Longfield demanding schools should be allowed to open at all costs - evenit means shutting pubs. She said: As I said earlier, this is also about doing everything we can to ensure our children canto school next week.Aberdeen schools are holding orientation sessions next Wednesday, with schools due to open fully the following Monday, th August.Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and space to protect the ability of our young people toto education.Ms Sturgeon said the decision to close hospitality venues was not taken lightly but extreme caution was necessary to tackle any growth in coronavirus cases. She said: Im also mindful of the need to act quickly and decisivelywe are to succeed in our aim of keeping transmission as close to elimination levels as possible.Local MP Stephen Flynn tweeted following the announcement: Restrictions being put back in place in Aberdeen is what we all feared. However, they are an absolute necessity in order to protect public health.

She called for regular testing of pupils and teachers - regardless of whether they show symptoms. Laying down a marker on future closures, she wrote: “If the choice has to be made in a local area about whether to keep pubs or schools open, then schools must always take priority.”Ms Longfields briefing paper says keeping schools open should be the absolute priority, adding: Education should be prioritised over other sectors: first to open, last to close.When only a limited amount of social interaction is feasible, the amount accounted for by education must be protected - at the expense of other sectors activities.Ms Sturgeon said the comments from Ms Longfield helped inform her decision to shut down pubs again after a new outbreak of cases.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of the people who are still working from home  per cent of Brits are doing so five day a week. That compares to only  per cent of employees in France, and  per cent of staff in Germany.The PM formally scrapped the work from home advice last month and encouraged employers to work with their staff to start the transition back to the office. Despite pushing back further reopening of the nation by two weeks because of fears of a second wave, the PM went ahead with plans to get people back in the office. But many companies have said they will keep their staff working at home well into next year. Google announced last week that all of its staff worldwide would stay working from home until summer . The change in advice was aimed to try and stem the devastatingjob losses on the high street as sales plunged. Days before the PMs formal announcement, the Government chief scientic adviser Patrick Vallance cast doubt on the safety of sending people back to work. Last week, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty warned Britain had reached the limits of reopening. WH Smith and MCo slashed hundreds of jobs today, bringing the number of of workers facing redundancy in the UK because of coronavirus over ,.Revenue at WH Smith was down  per cent last month compared to July  - with most of the heaviest losses being felt at stores in airports and train stations.

Thousands were injured in the fireball which flattened buildings, ripped peoples clothes from their bodies and damaged properties up to six miles away.The blast - which has caused up to £bn worth of damage -was so large it could be heard  miles across the sea in Cyprus.It has emerged the powder-keg of chemicals was shipped by Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin who has been accused of abandoning it in Beirut.What we know so far:The killer cargo was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueIt had stopped due to “a mal” in Beirut where sailors were forced to stay on board to ensure its safety.Sailors protested that Grechushkin claimed he had gone bankrupt and had abandoned the ship - going on hunger strike before finally being allowed to go ashore.Grechushkin was said to have paid a “huge penalty” for transporting the cargo without authority which led to him going bust - later moving to Cyprus with his we Irina.Neither the businessman nor his family have yet commented on the explosion, which had one fth the power of a nuclear bomb.The Russian captain of the ship Boris Prokoshev, now , warned at the time of the deadly nature of the cargo.He said: “The vessel’s owner abandoned it and we were abandoned too. We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.Anger is mounting as Lebanons government and customs officials point fingers at each other as to who is the blame for the monstrous explosion.Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media in an indication of the fury that followed the initial shock and grief.Ramez al-Qadi, a prominent TV anchor, tweeted: Either they keep killing us or we kill them.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .President Michel Aoun said the government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since  to be put under house arrest.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.The minister claimed he followed up on the matter but his work was then delayed by coronavirus lockdowns.Najjar said he eventually spoke the general manager of the port on Monday - the day before the blast.He said he asked him to send him all the relevant documentation, so that he could look into this matter.Najjar said he learned on Wednesday that his ministry had sent at least  letters to the Beirut urgent matters judge since , asking for the goods to be disposed of. The judiciary didnt do anything, he said. Its negligence.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will pay the price as rescue operations continue in Beirut.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for those potentially still trapped beneath the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance, as President Aoun declared three days of mourning and announced he would release £m of emergency fundsMr Raab said: I think the people of the Lebanon deserve no less - and that there will be full accountability.He added the the details of Brits caught up in the Beirut blast was still being established - with a number known to have been injured.HMS Enterprise will carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.Beiruts governor Marwan Aboud said as many as , people may have been left homeless with many buildings reduced to an uninhabitable mess of rubble and glass.There are concerns of food shortages and unrest in the city, with the blast compounding anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.US Pentagon sources also described the blast as a tragic accident - after President Donald Trump said he believed it was caused by “a bomb.Trump said his forces stood ready to assist after the terrible attack claiming his security advisors “seem to think it was an attack, a bomb of some kind.He last night appeared to backtrack on the attack claim.The Foreign Office confirmed several staff based at the embassy more than three miles from the port needed hospital treatment but declined to give any details.A spokesman said: “All Embassy staff are accounted for.

Speaking as someone who was badly stung on location while filming Man Vs Wild a few years ago, I know how serious an attack can be.If you stumble upon a nest and the bees or wasps start to swarm, my first piece of advice is: Run.My second piece of advice is: Keep running. Run until you are out of the immediate area.While running, hold your breath so you don’t breathe any of them in.Try to cover your head and face with your hands, or ideally, a towel. If you are stung, try to remove the stingit is visible, wash the area, use ice to cool it and consider an ­antihistamine.If you are allergic to wasp and bee stings like I am, seek medical attention immediately.You are best off avoiding the nestat all ­possible. Change your route, give it a wide berth and move away.If you play outdoors, climb, hike, ride or ramble, at some point you will pick up bumps, grazes and cuts.In the outdoors, and particularly in the UK when walking and hiking, you will no doubt at some point veer off the path and have to climb a barbed wire fence. Avoid this at all costspossible butyou have no other option, try the tips below.If the worst has happened and you do suffer a bad cut, reach for the first aid bag and treat a bleeding wound.You must always ­remember the catchword “PEEPS”. It stands for . . . P – Position: Check where the injury is and ask your casualty to sit down.E – Expose and examine: Seeit is clean and free of foreign bodies.E – Elevate your limbthat’s where you are injured.P – Pressure: Apply it directly over the injury. Use a bandage, a hanky or even just your hand.Clean the wound­possible and bandage it.As soon as you can, seek medical attention for the casualty, as they may need stitches or a tetanus injection.Getting lost can happen so easily, even for experienced or trained walkers and mountaineers.The weather closes in, you lose track of the path or the features around you and suddenly you realise you are lost. You go for your GPS unit or even your phone, but guess what – there is no signal.Stop, don’t panic and take time to think what to do.Look around you. Are there big features to recognise, such as rivers, mountains, lakes or a forest If you can, retrace your steps to a place where you know where you are.Follow a river downstream. They usually lead to civilisation.If it’s getting dark, stay put. Don’t drink from rivers or streams as the water may be contaminated. If you are desperately thirsty find moving water, filter it through a sock and boil it.Pee is your last resort – it’s not nice and will likely adversely affect your ­overall hydration levels.Find overhead cover – a cave or tree – to protect you from winds. Stay warm and dry, using layers of clothing or stuff clothing with grass as insulation.Check food and water – and plan to be out all night.After watching BBC documentary Saving Lives At Sea, schoolboy Raviraj Saini, knew what to do when he was torn from his family by a riptide in the sea off the North Yorkshire coast this week.The ten-year-old followed the RNLI’s Float To Live advice – to float calmly until he was rescued – rather than thrashing about in the water.As Raviraj knew, the RNLI’s guidance says thatyou are drowning, fight your instinct to thrash around.Lean back, extend your arms and legs and gently move them to help you float. Stay bobbing on the water on your back until your breathing recovers.Rip currents can flow faster than an Olympic swimmer at mph and can drag unsuspecting swimmers out to sea. They are hard to spot but choppy water could be a sign.If you get pulled away by a rip current, the RNLI advises you don’t try to swim against the tide as you’ll exhaust yourself and could drown.Don’t swim towards the shore. First swim parallel to the current before heading for the beach.Some UK areas are remote and hard to reach for rescuers. So as we say in the Scouts: “Be prepared.”Always let someone know where you are heading. Perhaps make a route plan and leave it with someone. Take the correct equipment, such as spare clothes, food, water, an up-to-date first aid kit, map and ­compass, and know how to use them all.If you are injured, don’t panic, stay calm and don’t move unless you have to.Treat the injury, look at your resources and apply first aidyou can.If you don’t have a phone signal, you will have to wait to be rescued.While you wait, there are things you can do to attract help. Make an SOS sign out of clothing on the ground.Use a whistle and give a distinctive call. Wave both arms in the air to attract attention.Call or shout for help and use a mirror or shiny object to attract attention.Hot summers and warm water temperatures can attract jellyfish to Britain’s coasts – and with them comes the risk of a nasty sting. You might have heard that peeing on a jellyfish sting will help to soothe the pain.But I would try other options first, as stinking of wee doesn’t make for the best mini-break . . . I have been stung many times by jellyfish over the years, and mostly it is just irritating – a bit like a bee or wasp sting.Even so, do beware – some jellyfish that can be found on British beaches, such as the fearsome Portuguese man of war, can inflict some super- serious stings on unsuspecting holidaymakers. To treat a jellyfish sting, rinse the area in water or vinegar.Then remove any ­obvious tentacles with a pair of tweezers.Next, soak the site where you were stung in hot water for at least  minutes.And finally, apply a mild hydrocortisone cream to help with the pain and ease the swelling.Over the years I’ve eaten all kinds of wild food – from all sorts of plants to nasty looking and tasting bugs and worms.But it’s easy to get it wrong in a survival situation – and easy to make a mistake at home. If in doubt, never be tempted to try “foods” you might find in the wild, such as mushrooms or berries.If you’re not somewhere where you can call the emergency services, try to make yourself or your patient vomit by putting your fingers down the back of the throat.Swallowing a small ­quantity of cold charcoal from a camp fire can also act as an emetic – or vomit-inducer – and may prevent your blood from absorbing certain poisons.Crush the charcoal and mix it with some fresh water. Likewise, white ash mixed with fresh water can ease stomach cramps and is sometimes an antidote to hydrocyanic acid poisoning.Get any remaining part of the poisonous article out of your mouth or that of a child.Take the poison plant or berries with you to a ­hospital Accident and Emergency department.People get injured by cows every year in the UK, even though they are quiet and timid animals.We do a lot of filming around large game and the principles are basically the same for our home-grown cattle. Any time you present a threat to almost any animal, get ready for action in .A single cow is likely to be more scared of you than you are of it.Just stand your ground, make a lot of noise and it will likely run away.If the herd is running directly for you, you need to get to the edge of the field and out of there ASAP.Try to get something between you and the cows.You’re unlikely to be able to run faster than a cow, as they move at  to mph, sowalking through a field of cows, be respectful. You are in their domain, so remain calm, quiet and quickly try to pass by them.If you can avoid the field, do so. Butyou have to go through, don’t get between cows and their calves and avoid moving directly through the herd.This will only agitate them.Finally, keep your dog on a lead, close by you and under control.Even small rivers in non-extreme environments are prone to sudden and dangerous flooding.There is a river in Brecon where we do the Bear Grylls Survival Academy course, called the Lightning River – and for good reason. One minute it’s perfectly safe to cross, the next it’s fast-flowing white water.Wherever possible, you should avoid trying to cross flood waters.They move fast and are always much more powerful than you might have imagined.Even in knee-deep water you run a high risk of being swept away.Moreover, flood water often contains fast-moving debris – cars, boulders, even trees.Sometimes these are hidden below the surface, so you won’t even see them before they hit you.If you have to cross a flooded road, use a long stick to probe the ground ahead of you for hidden deep patches.Be particularly wary of downed power lines that could still be live and lethal.In general, your priority must be to head for high ground.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Clemmie Hambro was Princess Dianas youngest bridesmaid at her wedding with Prince Charles in July . Flight logs seen by the Mail show that she flew on Epsteins jet after visiting his ranch in New Mexico and his Little St James island, known to locals as Paedo island. Epsteins island of Little St James lies between St Thomas and St John, two of the largest islands of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.The -acre island was bought by the financier in  for an estimated .million and was owned by him until his death in .Miss Hambros first flight, from Epstein’s “New Zorro” ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico to Teterboro airport in New York, was taken on February ,  with two other women as well as Epstein himself. She said the New Mexico trip was a “work trip” to help the financier decide which art to buy for the ranch. The second trip, meanwhile, took place on March  when she flew from St Thomas - used by Epstein to reach Little St James island- to Teterboro airport.She said this trip was a “personal invitation, adding that she “didn’t know anyone there and “didn’t really enjoy myself”. According to the records, Epstein was present on both flights. Epsteins longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trial for allegedly aiding Epsteins abuse, was also present for one of the trips.The now married mum-of-four was a -year old employee at Christies auction house in New York when she made the trips in .Miss Hambros contact details were also listed in Epsteins infamous Little Black Book, according to the Mail.A statement from Miss Hambro read: The first flight was a work trip with female colleagues to look at Epstein’s new home in Santa Fe to discuss what art he was going to buy.The second trip, to Little St James, was a personal invitation, which I thought would be fun to accept, but I didn’t know anyone there, didn’t really enjoy myself, and never went back. My heart breaks for all the survivors, now I know what happened on that island.In the course of those two trips, I was not abused, nor did I see anyone abused, or anything untoward happen, with minors or otherwise. I have been completely horried about the revelations of his conduct since then. I was clearly very lucky, my heart goes out to those who were abused by him, and I trust they get the justice they so deserve.She added: I was young and naive, and could not conceive of what was to unfold.There is no suggestion she was involved in any wrongdoing.Epstein bought the island of Little St James more than two decades ago, transforming it into a high-security private oasis.Court papers allege that prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well known prime minister and other world leaders have visited the island before.It is alleged that the American lawyer and academic Alan Dershowitz was seen on the island - a claim he has repeatedly denied.Epsteins alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, is also said to visited the island a number of times.Bombshell legal papers also claim that former president Bill Clinton once flew to Jeffrey Epsteins orgy island with two young girls, The Sun reported last week.In the documents Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre  says the former US president visited Epsteins infamous private Caribbean Island.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedall the family would go with her to court and we said, ‘Of course.’“I was then called on Saturday lunchtime to say Carrie had died. I believe she was heartbroken.“I know nothing will bring her back, but I do want people to know what a lovely, kind, generous person she was.“She never spoke badly of anyone and was totally loyal.”Christine said Caroline’s death was caused by the Crown Prosecution Service’s insistence on holding a celebrity “show trial” over a fight she had with boyfriend Lewis Burton.Police had been called to Caroline’s flat in December after the fight and arrested her.The CPS decided to make her stand trial for assault despite the fact Lewis did not want charges brought — and knowing Caroline was suffering mental distress.Caroline, , who had a history of depression, was clearly distraught at a magistrates hearing on December  at which she denied assault. Her crown court trial was fixed for March.On February  she was found dead in her North London flat.Her inquest yesterday heard that Caroline was distraught in the weeks after her arrest and tormented by the thought of a trial.Christine, in a statement read to the inquest, said: “My family and I are totally devastated by the untimely and unnecessary death of my beautul daughter.“I believe she was seriously let down by the authorities and particularly by the CPS.“I believe this was a show trial. I feel the prosecutor was unkind to Caroline and my family.“I was threatened with arrest when I tried to speak. Being well known should not allow special treatment but should not allow making an example of someone.”Christine, who could be seen weeping on a video link as her statement was read by coroner Mary Hassell, denied her daughter had been violent.And she denied claims that Caroline had hit Lewis with a lamp during the row.She said she had received a letter of apology from the former head of the CPS over its claims. Her statement said: “I received a written apology from Ed Beltrami about comments he made about my daughter and I find it amazing something like that has not reached the media.“A lamp was never involved in the assault. It was a phone.“There was disputed evidence read out in court and picked up by reporters. But it was disputed.“The result of the media attention of this hearing forced Caroline to leave the home she loved and eventually led her to take her le.“Through all of this Caroline was told not to speak, to tell her side of the story, she was told the CPS could not possibly take it to trial because she didn’t beat Lewis.“The only person hurt that night was Caroline. An awful picture was sold to the Press. Caroline was told not to speak while all the time her heart was breaking She lost the job she worked so hard at.”Caroline took her le a day after her final hopes of avoiding a trial were dashed by the CPS.Her legal team sent mental health reports to the CPS saying she was in bad shape and would deterioratethe trial went ahead.A psychiatrist warned about a “major depressive episode”.But the CPS rejected that plea and brushed aside the fact that tennis coach Lewis, , was not supporting the prosecution.Paramedics had already been called to Caroline’s flat the day before her death over a prescription drugs overdose — one of four previous attempts to take her le.Psychiatrist Tamsin Lewis treated Caroline ahead of her first court appearance. She said: “She was incredibly distressed and needed some sleeping aids.”Ms Lewis said the presenter told her the fight with Lewis was “nothing more than a lover’s tf, heightened by alcohol”.The psychiatrist added: “She reported having panicky feelings all day — a sense of impending doom.”Caroline’s sister Jody told Poplar Coroner’s Court, East London, the TV presenter had been in a bad way before her death and did not want to leave her home.She said: “Caroline seemed very sad the day before her death — she seemed to have lost her fight. She was in a very anxious frame of mind from the day she was charged with assault on her boyfriend Lewis. She was anxious about press coverage and the abuse she would receive from the public.”Jody also criticised the CPS, saying: “The shame of the charge against her, which did not match the reality of what happened, was too much to cope with.“A mistake which ended in a minor injury to her boyfriend requiring no medical attention and serious injuries to herself, resulted in national condemnation for being a physical abuser of men.“This was something she could not see ever going away. The CPS continued even though Lewis wasn’t behind it.“The Press and public found it an entertaining angle and the ­matter spiralled out of control and became more dficult for Caroline to comprehend.”TELLY star Caroline left a note ­saying she wanted to “find harmony” with boyfriend Lewis Burton.The handwritten message was found by paramedics in her flat on top of an open magazine.It read: “I hope me and Lewis can one day find harmony.”In a statement, tennis player Lewis, , told the inquest of her fragile state.He said: “The last time I saw Caroline she was very upset, in fact, devastated. She was not in a good place emotionally.“What was bothering her most was the police case and losing her presenting job on Love Island, the negative media attention plus not being able to see me.”Jody said her sister, who stepped down from Love Island days after her arrest, felt her le was collapsing around her.She added: “The le and reputation she worked hard to build was falling apart to the point of noover a  accusation.“Her mental state was very fragile at this time and it was widely agreed by those involved that it would not be happening to hershe were not in the public eye. Her punishment did not fit the crime.“At the least she was being made a spectacle of nationally. At worst her career and reputation, so precious to her, had been taken away.”Friend Mollie Grosberg said Caroline had been stunned when the CPS dashed her last hopes.She added: “The day before her death she had a meeting with her lawyers that she was looking ­forward to because she hoped to hear the case was being dropped.“But she heard the opposite and it really threw her.”Mollie raced to Caroline’s home after getting a WhatsApp message saying: “I am killing myself and you don’t know where I am.”It doesnt discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.Its the biggest killer of people under the age of , more deadly than cancer and car crashes.And men are three times more likely to take their own le than women.Yet its rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.That is why The Sun launched the Youre Not Alone campaign.The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.Lets all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... Youre Not Alone.If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:Mollie said: “She was unconscious on her sofa, there were tablets everywhere.“Caroline was askedit was a suicide attempt and she said no, she had a headache. But it obviously wasn’t true.”Mollie said Caroline refused to go to hospital. Paramedics had been called but they left.The next morning Caroline was furious her friends had dialled .Mollie said: “When she needed us most she pushed us away.“She pushed everyone away, she always did that.“She kept saying, ‘No one will ever understand what I’m going through’. She was so scared to go to prison and of the police and the Press. It was too much.”Caroline was found dead in her flat by Stephen Teasdale, father of one of her friends.Efforts to revive her failed. The hearing continues.CAROLINE had tried to take her own le on four previous occasions, her family revealed.Her sister Jody told the inquest the presenter had struggled in the past to overcome her insecurities.She said: “She battled suicidal thoughts in the past and depression and anxiety. An ambulance was called on four occasions after attempted overdoses.“Heartbreak was always something Caroline felt extremely dficult to deal with emotionally.”The inquest heard of two previous occasions, including one in her flat on the night before Caroline died.Close friend Mollie Grosberg said the star had apparently taken herbal sleeping tablets and paracetamol.She said: “We went in and she’d smashed up the TV and thrown her plant on the floor.“She was unconscious on her sofa. There were tablets everywhere.”Her friends were reluctant to call police or an ambulance because Caroline did not trust them.But Mollie said she eventually called  and was told an ambulance was on its way.She added: “After an hour it hadn’t come so I called  and they said they were trying to find us.“Caroline was coming round by this point and talking gibberish about India.Caroline was askedit was a suicide attempt and she said no, she had a headache.“But it obviously wasn’t true. Caroline was refusing to go to hospital but was still totally incoherent.“It was eventually agreed she wasn’t going and I got very angry and shouted. I said it was ridiculous — but the paramedics saidshe was refusing to go they couldn’t take her.”Paramedic Tony Rumore told the inquest he had no powers to force the star to go to hospital or detain her under the Mental Health Act.He said: “We asked Carolineher intention was to harm or kill herself.“She said it was merely an attempt to sleep and escape from the stresses she was under.”The inquest also heard Caroline overdosed in a London hotel room on December  — the day before her magistrates court appearance.Harley Street psychiatrist Dr Brian Wells said he found the presenter in bed and vomiting into a bin.He added: “She had become distressed about the court appearance and drunk considerable amounts of alcohol and what’s thought to be a mixture of medications.“Perhaps ten tablets in total. No one in the room seemed to know where the tablets came from.”PROSECUTORS defended the decision to put Caroline Flack on trial — after initially thinking of giving her just a caution.Lisa Ramsarran, deputy chief crown prosecutor in North London, said boyfriend Lewis Burton suffered head injuries and had claimed Caroline was “trying to kill him”.She said the presenter struck Lewis with a lamp — which is disputed by the family, while Caroline claimed she had used a phone.Ms Ramsarran said: “The overall position, in terms of the prosecution case, is that Mr Burton had been struck with an object to the head.”She said there was enough evidence to charge the TV star and said cases involving domestic ­violence allegations have to be treated “particularly seriously”.Prosecutors were not given any information from her lawyers about a deterioration in her mental health after December , she added.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Track-and-trace, launched in May, is essential to keep the virus at bay as Downing Street looks to avoid ato a national lockdown and prioritise containing local clusters of infections.Contact tracing works by stopping the spread of coronavirus through a community, with authorities hoping that by isolating an infected person you can stop the chain of transmission.Three councils in West Yorkshire - Calderdale, Kirklees and Bradford- are now planning to implement their own system after claiming that the national system isnt up to scratch.Calderdale council, which has the sixth highest infection rate in England, told the Mirror they hope their system will be up and running very soon.

The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has defended the number of people being contacted and asked to isolate as part of the Test and Trace system, saying it is improving all the time.Rupert Soames, CEO of Serco, one of the providers running the test  trace call centres, defended the system claiming it had been blown out of proportion. He told BBC Radio : I think we need to get this into proportion. Youre giving me the numbers saying that were tracing % of contacts, let me tell you that % of the people that we talk to agree to self-isolate.So weve got a very, very high success rate of people that we get to contact.He blamed people being unable to recall who they had met on the failure to reach contacts of cases. He said: If somebody rang you now and I said tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last  hours and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details, how many do you think that youd be able to reel off of the top of your head And the fact is that about % of the contacts that people give us, say I know I sat next so somebody on a bus on the way in but I dont have their contact details. Im sorry, but my brother-in-law brought around a friend last night, I dont have their contact details. So there is an element of that and it is about % at the moment where people cant remember or never knew the contact... the details of where they were.The failed contact tracing app trialled by the Government on the Isle of Wight will be re-launched to help tell people about their infection levels in their area. A version of the app is being developed to help people use their personal information to calculate a risk score, according to The Times. The app was initially hoped to help the contact tracing effort but it failed to be accurate enough to use, and instead the Government backed Google  Apples efforts to develop a contact tracing app. Shadow health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said local authorities needed to be put in the driving seat for the system to be effective. He told BBC Radio : “The problem with the national system, where you effectively get a call from a  number from a call centre run by an outsource company like Serco, is that they are not as effective as the on the ground authority.  “When you look at the statistics, the [local authority] has a much better success rate. That’s because after  hoursSerco can’t get hold of people - which is around  per cent - they pass the contacts over to local public health officials, and they have a success rate of around  per cent. So they are clearly better at getting hold of people.”  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Three councils in West Yorkshire plan to introduce their own way of tracking down infected residents and their contacts. Traders say it may be the only chance of saving their business. The Government’s system is “not fit for purpose”, according to Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. The councils in Calderdale, Kirklees and Bradford are now planning to implement their own track and trace systems. Calderdale council leader Cllr Tim Swt, whose region has the sixth highest infection rate in England, said they hope theirs will be “up and running very soon”. Bradford council said bosses are in talks with the Government, while Kirklees council is in “the very early stages”.  It follows concerns about the speed and effectiveness of the £billion national system after a report this week revealed only half of contacts are being traced. Kirsty Ferridge, , who owns The Albion pub in Bradford, said she would have to shut down the boozer for goodshe is forced to close again due to another full lockdown. The Government announced last week the city was among the places to have to go into partial lockdown. Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Calderdale and Kirklees were the others.  Local authorities in eight of the worst-hit areas in England have now launched or are planning to launch their own track and trace schemes. Blackburn and Darwen council’s public health boss said the national one was “simply not tracing enough cases and contacts fast enough”. The local systems will include tracers knocking on doors as well as phoning people. Special envoy to the World Health Organisation, Dr David Nabarro, said it was “absolutely” the right move to have more locally run track and trace systems.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has claimed that this major overhaul of the planning system will speed up the housebuilding process and “cut red tape but not standards”. But campaigners are concerned that the plans will harm the environment and see Tories ditch or water-down a requirement for big developers to contribute to infrastructure around big new developments, potentially piling pressure on cash strapped councils. Mr Jenrick said the Conservatives’ latest reforms will protect green spaces while making it easier to build on “brownfield land”. The White Paper proposes a planning system with three categories of land – earmarked for growth, renewal and protection – but campaigners tonight said its risks creating a “disconnected landscape, one in which wildle continues to decline because nature doesn’t slot into neat little boxes”. Plans for the first time buyers discount, first revealed as part of the budget, are expected to feature in the White Paper. The government claims this will save buyers tens of thousands of pounds when getting on the property ladder. New aposFirst Homesapos earmarked for a discount will stay at a low price for all future owners also from the same area too. Key workers, such as nurses, police officers, firefighters, and teachers, as well as armed forces veterans, will be given priority in this scheme. However, a pilot will involve only , First Homes. And once the scheme is up and running, only % of affordable homes on a development - rather than % of all homes - will need to be First Homes. Once the % discount is applied, there will be a price cap on First Homes of £, across England and £, in London. Those buying First Homes will be subject to a household income cap of £,, or £, in London. They will mainly only be available to first-time buyers, but there will also be a list of circumstances under which non-first-time buyers should be eligible. That list is yet to be confirmed. First Homes will have to be marketed to people with local connections for the first three months after going on the market - but after that, the local restrictions will end and other people can buy them. But once the original buyer sells up, they wonapost be able to make a fat profit, the government claims. There will be a restrictive covenant against the title of the property to ensure that relevant restrictions, including the original level of discount, are passed on to future purchasers. A consultation on the plans is ongoing. Mr Jenrick said it takes seven years to agree local housing plans and five years just to get a spade in the ground, and the proposed changes aim to speed up the process. He added: “These once-in-a-generation reforms will lay the foundations for a brighter future, providing more homes for young people and creating better quality neighbourhoods and homes across the country. “We will cut red tape, but not standards, placing a higher regard on quality, design and the environment than ever before. Planning decisions will be simple and transparent, with local democracy at the heart of the process. “As we face the economic effects of the pandemic, now is the time for decisive action and a clear plan for jobs and growth. Our reforms will create thousands of jobs, lessen the dominance of big builders in the system, providing a major boost for small building companies across the country.” Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said the reforms “will allow housebuilders to get to work”. But environmental campaigners expressed concerns. Tom Fyans, deputy chief executive of CPRE , said: “The key acid test for the planning reforms is community involvement, and on first reading it’s still not clear how this will work under a zoning system.

Ornaments. Ephemera that gave colleagues, friends, family, or viewers suddenly spending % of the day in front of the television, an idea of your personality as you broadcast from the back bedroom.We established, or rearranged, our home offices, and removed things that were rude or incriminating from shot. The Royal Family had their staff set up the Zoom calls, and organise hundreds of photographs in strict order of precedence and favouritism. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, on the other hand, went with a bare wall.  To be fair, it is an million wall, in a mansion theyaposve been loaned, and it is probably the only background which didnapost have some gold in it. But their minimalist approach to public le is not only in stark contrast to the Royalsapos rather cluttered one - that wall weaposve seen so much of says everything about why Meghan and Harry have had such a bad pandemic. Their escape from protocol has not given them freedom - it provided an extra barrier, behind which they have little idea of the current mood. When coronavirus meant people were denied contact with each other, they yearned to connect remotely, and for background info to fill in the blanks. All the Sussexes gave them was another blank.William and Kate gave us only a cream wall and half-open door, but it at least raised possibilities of a small Royal child bombing in to demand some foie gras. And they did oversee some elderly gambling while using bingo lingo, which is up there on the list of top Royal moments that includes parachuting into the Olympics.Harry and Meghan do a good line in earnestness. Theyaposve spoken out on issues, like Black Lives Matter and repeated Joe Bidenaposs campaign slogans, which would have been deemed too politicalthey were still aposinapos the monarchy. But, as court filings have proven, they havenapost made the best decisions. They moved to the USA  hours after Donald Trump declared a national emergency, and now find themselves at the deadly epicentre of a pandemic. Theyaposve become mired in expensive court cases on two continents, and even in their protected private enclave are so plagued by drone-operating paparazzi that they havenapost just been locked down and sealed off, theyaposve barely been into the garden.Twenty two acres, a massive swimming pool, and they canapost step off the terrace to enjoy any of it. They say their young son, whose welfare is of the utmost concern to them, hasnapost left the building once.  And while theyaposve struggled to set up a new foundation and been embarrassed by revelations the last, pointless, one cost Princess Dianaaposs charity £, to set up, the monarchy they left behind has not put a foot wrong. The Queen has Zoomed. Anne marked her th with a documentary about her le that did not involve a single complaint. Charles recovered from Covid-, and avoided criticism for importing it to Scotland. Camilla has spoken out, forcefully, about domestic abuse. And Wills and Kate have had an absolute banger - bingo, baby banks, and a curry with Peter Crouch. The things they do and say are amplied by their status. And by wearing masks in public, Camilla and Kate have done more to protect and promote public health messaging than the entire Cabinet.Harry and Meghan delivered food parcels early on, but even George and Charlotte did that. The Sussexes have since concentrated on sucking lemons and delivering speeches, which has not had the same impact since they gave up the status which gave them a loudspeaker. Prince Andrew, of course, hasnapost gone away, and nor have the allegations about his friendship with a billionaire paedophile. But they have become repetitive, and with alleged pimp Ghislaine Maxwell under lock and key some of the heat is off him, for now.The monarchyaposs popularity, and its usefulness, are in robust health. Andrew is its only weakness, and heaposs been hidden away on the Royal estates which Harry and Meghan felt didnapost hide them enough.The Sussex machine, meanwhile, is graunching its gears. Itaposs shown all the grace and timing of Ann Widdecombe spinning on her bum across the Strictly dance floor. As millions struggle to survive, physically and financially, these two gave the thumbs-up to a book that cemented their petulance in the public mind. A long list of complaints about this girl and her baggage, the sacrices they made which few of us can see, the sensible advice they ignored, and the bruised egos of a couple who thought they would inherit Dianaaposs sainthood, without having to earn it or die for it. Despite being favourable to them, it even indicates they may have lied to the world about their engagement. And the Queen comes out of it looking like she has better manners than either of them. Letaposs be frank - without Royalty, the Royals are nothing. Just an expanding group of well-fed, over-privileged, people who would not be able to earn, represent good causes or holiday for free as they do now. What Harry and Meghan are learning, the hard way, is that applies to them, too. Their star power as Royals was immense - but outside the monarchy, it is waning. They have less protection, higher costs, and the same, stratospheric expectations of the good they can do and the le they will lead.And with the book, theyaposve just burned the one-year probation period negotiated before their departure. How can they ever appear on the balcony again, with the world knowing the details of a common family ruckus, in a family thataposs not supposed to be common  The Royals hate the goldfish bowl too, but they trade the state benefits for doing things useful to the state. They hobnob with whatever nobs the Prime Minister tells them to, co-ordinate their Press appearances, share out the charity work. Their continued existence as Royals, however right or wrong it may be, is strangely socialist, and protected by that of all the others. The Sussexes left the goldfish bowl, and found themselves in a shark tank. Their only friends will be friendless celebrities, the staff less loyal, the public more sceptical, and thereaposll not be a single person able, or authorised, to protect them from what will necessarily be a nakedly capitalist descent towards, inevitably, a line of vegan lingerie.And itaposs all a damned shame, because the day that Meghan walked herself down the aisle to marry a prince with little purpose, it seemed like they would do wonders for us and each other.Instead, they were unhappy, they left everyone  unhappy, and they seem to still be unhappy. Their future holds infinite further amounts of unhappiness, with court cases that, eventhey win, will air more dirty laundry than any sane person would want, and a le that will be lived undercover."},{"url":null,"title":"bridesmaid princess diana guest jeffrey","story":"NewsBridesmaid for Princess Diana was guest on Jeffrey Epsteins island and flew in his jetsClemmie Hambro, who was Dianas youngest bridesmaid at just five, has revealed she twice visited Jeffrey Epsteins properties within weeks in  and said she had \"very lucky\" escapesShareByRyan Merrield:,  AUG NewsClemmie Hambro visited the island\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in leafy Cheshire is making the navy blue, embroidered masks, part of the official unorm and admits it is contrary to Government guidelines.The academy, a secondary school and sixth form centre, says masks will form part of our unorm, CheshireLive reports.In a letter to parents, the school body stated: Everyone, students and staff, MUST wear a face covering whilst inside the school buildings. This includes classrooms and corridors. Masks will form part of our unorm. We have taken this decision as a precautionary additional measure to our expected safe behaviours. On the balance of probability, the wearing of face masks is likely to make our school safer thanwe don’t wear them. The school is understood to be requiring pupils to wear navy blue, reusable face masks.Parents are instructed to purchase these from local company Sam Dale and Son, for £.  These will have HCCS embroidered on them, according to a Facebook post from the company.The school is also reminding students of the need to wash their hands. Seventy five specially sourced dispensers have been fitted outside of classrooms, continues the newsletter. Every student and member of staff must clean their hands as they enter each lesson. There are no exceptions or excuses. At the time of writing, the Government says that face masks will not be necessary in schools in England. Wearing a face covering or face mask in schools or other education settings is not recommended,states the guidance. Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School headteacher Nigel Bielby admits the school is going against the guidelines.  He told the BBC: I think we’re going contrary to the guidelines because we want to keep a community that’s safe and protect those vulnerable members of our community as far as we possibly can. We felt it was an important step that, on the balance of probability, we were more likely to feel our children and our community was safer using a face covering as opposed to not using a face covering – and of course when the children are not in those lessons and they’re outside they can take that face covering off, so the misunderstanding that the children are in a face covering for six hours a day is incorrect. “I think most of our community and our children will understand why we’ve taken this temporary measure and I think most of them will understand this is about the safety of the community and the care of our children. Councillor Kathryn Flavell, Cheshire East Council cabinet member for children and families, said: “The academy, Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, is the only school that we are aware of that has implemented a temporary arrangement of mandatory face masks for pupils when theyto school in September. “Our education team has been supporting all schools, including Holmes Chapel, to implement the guidance issued by the Department for Education on full opening from September, which clearly states that children are not expected to wear face coverings at school. “The Department for Education position is based on the best scientic advice and Public Health England does not currently recommend face coverings use as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups, and because misuse may inadvertently increase the risk of transmission. There may also be negative effects on communication and children’s education.

He told BBC Radio Lancashire: That is my personal and professional opinion given the statistics, the direction of travel and given the size of the issue.  Revellers flocked to the reopened Switch nightclub, but many Preston residents branded it aposrecklessapos. Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said to open a venue of  young people with drink is just not helpful at all.  He added that it was irresponsible as the city is aposon the cusp of restrictions this weekapos. Swindon Southaposs Tory MP Robert Buckland has played down the possibility of a local lockdown, saying: Whilst this is signicant and serious incident, there is no evidence to suggest that Swindon is in a similar position to other towns that have seen community outbreaks. On Twitter, Alicia Kearns, Tory MP for Melton and Rutland, said: I know residents have been worried by recent national media reporting that Melton is experiencing an increase in COVID- cases and reports that we may be on the verge of having to lock down. “This is absolutely not the case: no lockdown is planned.  “In Melton we have seen an increase in cases locally, with around  cases in total in the last week. “As a result, preventative action is being taken to make sure we identy and isolate the virus, and prevent it from spreading any further in our communities.

Figures from the Covid Symptom Study app estimate that , people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. These figures also highlight that the North currently has higher prevalence rates than the regions in the South. Last week, for the first time, the data science team at ZOE and King’s College London created a aposCovid Symptom Study Watch List,apos which show where the highest estimates of symptomatic Covid in the past week are. The new analysis found that the majority of regions on the watch list are in the North of England. Blackburn with Darwen topped the list, where .% of the population have coronavirus symptoms as of July , which is a rise from the previous week. The number of symptomatic cases in the population is based on the daily new cases and symptoms being logged in the app, whereas incidence rates are simply the number of daily new cases based on the results from swab tests. Blackburn with Darwen was placed into a local lockdown recently following a spike in coronavirus cases. The Covid- infection rate was . cases per , in the week ending July , down from . the week before. Residents in the area cannot meet in dferent households, or people from other households inside pubs and restaurants, as of Friday, July . Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, said the latest data shows the symptoms get worse in the cold weather. “This week, the app also revealed that Covid symptoms and outcomes get worse in colder, less humid weather, which makes it even more important that we get this virus under control as we only have a month or two of warm weather left. Our data suggests that levels have bottomed out at around  cases per day which is too many, so we all need to be conscious of the dangers and to continue to practice high levels of personal hygiene, wear a face mask, social distance and know all the signs of early disease.”  Wrexham was second on the list with .% of the areaaposs population experiencing symptoms. All the reported coronavirus deaths in Wales for the last week have been in one hospital in Wrexham. WalesOnline reports Wrexham Maelor has been the centre of the virus in Wales with one doctor working there apparently describing it as re with Covid. For the seven days, between July  until August , the  deaths were reported in Wales were all at the hospital. Last week, Walesapos First Minister said there was no evidence to support enforcing a local lockdown in Wrexham.  “If the evidence were there that re-openingplaces in those communities would put people at risk then we would take a dferent course of action, but we will rely on the scientic evidence.“It’s why we’ve carried out the mass testing. I think nearly  people will have been tested in those two communities. Data from the symptom app also shows there are currently , daily new cases of Covid in the UK on average over the two weeks up to  July  . Similar to last week, the data suggests that the number of daily new cases in the UK have remained flat since last week. However, the data is beginning to show signs of a North South ide forming again. Mr Spector added: We are now starting to see the figures in the North creep up week on week.  The numbers are still very small so we can’t say with % certainty that Covid is increasing signicantly but it does make us focus on those areas. To understandthese increases are signicant or not, we need as many people as possible in these areas to be logging in the app. "},{"url":null,"title":"hero dog saves dad iams","story":"AdvertorialDad milliseconds from death - but hero dog senses danger and drags him to safetySuper Schnauzer Betzi Boo realised something bad was about to happen and took actionShareByDave Masters:,  JUL Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialMark at the scene of the accident, which closed a busy road for hours\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Weekly #TeamDogSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Anderton Park Primary in Birmingham was one of the schools targeted by anti-gay protesters because of its stance on equality. While children were not formally taught about the importance of challenging stereotypes and treating everyone equally, the ethos of the school meant it was included in all of their values - something Sarah is passionate about. She explained: We weave teaching equality into every day conversations and we talk about how boys and girls are equal throughout the whole school. The adults in school are all good role models and we make sure we watch our language and we challenge stereotypes in school every day. But in February last year, teachers, pupils are parents when a group of protesters set up camp outside the school and home time every day. Most days it could by up to  people and on one harrowing occasion, a group of  protesters turned up and forced Sarah to close the school early. She said: The protests were aggressive and inappropriate outside a school gate. They started at around :pm every day and lasted for  minutes. They were screaming down megaphones, which is completely the opposite of the ethos of the school. We donapost shout, weaposre very harmonious and we have a good relationship with the community and our parents. Sarah spent time talking with parents who had concerns both about the protests and what they believed was being taught at school. She said: We never stopped having these discussions, itaposs really important to have these conversations so we understand them and they understand us. These might be dferent to their beliefs at home and thataposs all part of a healthy society - along with respecting each others views. But itaposs also a pivotal part of education to prepare children for le in modern Britain. Anderton Park staff were forced to take drastic action to ensure as little disruption as possible. They changed the exits the pupils used at the end of every school day to keep them away from the protests - but it still had an impact on the children. Sarah said: The noise was awful. The protests were closest to our youngest children so it was terrible for them, as well as for the staff. But children are very resilient and couldnapost understand what was happening. They all understand equality completely. Sarah, who describes herself as a fiercely proud Brummie, and her team worked closely with Birmingham City Council to try to bring an end to the protests and ended up taking the protesters to court. But despite the ordeal she was putting up with daily, Sarah was never once tempted to back down. She said: Iaposm pretty resilient andanyone is going to take me, then doing it over equality is a good idea because itaposs very important to me. There was no way we were backing down.  If you bow down to one belief, itaposs a slippery slope. If you say itaposs not OK to say that some children have two dads, then you have to bow down to every belief. But it was pretty awful. I felt at one point that my soul had been crushed and I wasnapost sure I was ever going to get it back. I had a lot of good people around me, the brilliant kids at school, the senior leadership team, the staff at school, my two daughters and my partner. Finally, a court granted an injunction which meant the protesters had to be a certain distance from the school. While the children could still hear them, it wasnapost as threatening as it had been. Finally, last November, the courts granted an injunction that officially moved the protesters on.  Now the protesters are finally gone - although a few arrived when school started back again in September - Sarah has had a new crisis to deal with. The coronavirus pandemic. While Anderton Park has been empty of pupils for several months its headteacher has been a regular within its walls. Sarah cleared the schoolaposs freezers and food cupboards to provide food parcels for struggling families. A third of the pupils at the school are entitled to free school meals and with large families and small budgets common, many didnapost have access to the tehcnology to enable them to learn from home.

Bars, cafes and restaurants have been ordered to close by pm on Wednesday by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon following an outbreak of  cases in the city. The -year-old monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, who is , arrived at Aberdeen International Airport on Tuesday for their annual summer break at the royal pile in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire. The lockdown had been rolled out again as a surge in cases has heightens fears the Scottish Government is dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may include some community transmission, Ms Sturgeon said. A five-mile travel rule has been put in place and residents are being told not to enter each otheraposs houses and indoor and outdoor hospitality venues must close.  The measures, which apply to the Aberdeen City area, will be backed by government regulations, the First Minister said, and will be enforcedthe rules are not followed. The Scottish Government later announced that visits to hospital and care homes from a named family member or friend will be stopped, with only essential visits being allowed. The decision was taken following a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee , which also included leaders of Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland. Ms Sturgeon added the decision to reimpose some measures was taken to prevent further spread and to give the Test and Protect teams the best possible chance of successfully breaking these chains of transmission. The First Minister said people should not travel to Aberdeen, but those who are already there can remain. She added the changes will be reviewed next Wednesday, when she hopes they could be removed, either in entirety or in part. Ms Sturgeon said they could be extended beyond that seven-day periodnecessary.Speaking at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh on Wednesday, she said the rise in cases has contributed to a greater fear there has been a signicant outbreak in the city. NHS Grampian has named  bars and restaurants, three golf clubs and a football club as venues visited by people linked to the cluster. The bars and restaurants are The Bieldside Inn The Bobbin Brewdog Buckie Farm Carvery Cafe Andaluz Cafe Dag Cafe Drummond The Cock and Bull The College Bar The Dutch Mill Dyce Carvery East End Social Club Ferryhill House Hotel The Hawthorn The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGintyaposs McNastyaposs Malmaison Moonfish Cafe, No  Bar OaposDonoghues Old Bank Bar Prohibition Soul The Spiders Web, and The Draft Project.

Compass jellyfish - Chrysaora hysocella - can give a nasty sting and swimmers are being warned to keep their distance. Devon Live reports swarms of thousands of jellyfish are drting in and out off the shores of South Devon. Explorer and wildle expert Darren Murray captured shots of the Compass jellyfish off Brixham, while in his kayak. The Compass jellyfish are a summer visitor to Devonaposs shores, coming in as the waters get warmer.  Their brown markings lend them their name but donapost let them fool you - they could pack a nasty sting and often leave a tentacle behind after stinging a person. Interestingly, the jellyfish can continue to sting using the tentacle even after itaposs disconnected from the rest of its body. The Wildle Trusts confirms this startling bit of information: Once they have stung something, jellyfish often leave the tentacle behind and can continue to sting using it even when not to connected to their body. Darren, who is also a photographer, said: Itaposs a definite bloom of jellyfish.There are dferent types and thousands of them but they drt in and out so I was quite lucky to drt in amongst them. Another common visitor to Devon are the large barrel jellyfish - sometimes known as dustbin lid jellyfish.  Last year, a professional er and wildle photographer encountered a jellyfish the size of a human in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall. Dan Abbott and wildle presenter Lizzie Daly were just a couple of hundred yards from the shore when they spotted the enormous sea creature on a e in July . Dan, a shark expert who has swum around the world with tiger sharks, bull sharks and Great Whites, said spotting the huge barrel jellyfish was one of the most incredible things heaposd seen in British waters.  In July this hear hundreds of harmless aposmoon jellyfishapos have been spotted around the Devon coast.The six most common types of jellyfish found in UK waters* According to The Marine Biological Association . Moon jellyfish– it has four white rings. The stings are not powerful enough to penetrate human skin. . Compass jellyfish– this one has dark compass markings and itaposs sting is like that of nettles.  . Lion’s mane jellyfish– the second longest recorded animal in the world, it has red and orange tentacles. Itaposs sting causes temporary pain and redness and medical attention is recommended because of the number of stings. The tentacles can be broken into small pieces by storms. . Dustbin-lid jellyfish– this can grow up to  cm across but it has a weak sting. They have been seen in large numbers in our harbours.

But as these never-seen-before sketches of Buzz reveal – released to mark the th anniversary of the first film – it could all have been so dferent. Instead of the space ranger we have all come to know and love, animators at Pixar experimented with a series of dferent faces, colours and designs. Pixar historian Christine Freeman said: “Buzz is one of our most popular characters and it’s fascinating to see the dferent ways that Pixar’s artists imagined him during the evolution of his design. “Even his name changed over time – from Tempus of Morph to Lunar Larry, to Buzz Lightyear. You can see the LL belt buckle for Lunar Larry in a few of these early designs.” Since the first ever full- computer animated feature hit cinemas in November, , the Toy Story franchise has made an incredible £.billion worldwide. But it very nearly fell at the first hurdle. Back in , then fledgling animation firm Pixar signed a £m deal with Disney to produce three fully animated feature films.The problem was they’d never made one before. “We didn’t have any production expertise except for short films and commercials. So we were all complete novices,” says retired Pixar president Ed Catmull. Straight away there were problems with production, technology and scripts. And Disney, who could kill the deal – and Pixar – at any moment were getting impatient. In November,  – a date Pixar insiders refer to as “Black Friday” – they showed a rough cut of the film. The reaction was not good. “Guys, no matter how much you try to fix it,” Disney animation chief Peter Schneider said, “It just isn’t working.”  Although the animation was impressive, the story was flat and the characters were unrecognisable – sarcastic and cruel with a strained relationship between Buzz and Woody. Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody, said: “At first they were saying, ‘we want you to improvise, we want you to get at each other, you could be sarcastic with one another’. “It turned into a sort of cynicism that wasn’t really part of what the original sense of the DNA was.” Disney shut down production and the Pixar animators and writers locked themselves away to try to save their movie – and their company. They thrashed out a new storyline – with the bickering but warm friendship between Buzz and Woody at its heart. Screenwriter Andrew Stanton said: “It’s the ugliest picture we will ever make, but you don’t care because you get wrapped up in the story to this day.” Disney were shown the new version of the film and liked what they saw.  In March, , the actors including Hanks, Tim Allen, and Annie Potts, ed to Pixar to record the new script. The relaxed atmosphere gave the actors more freedom and many of the most famous scenes from the first movie are ad libs by Hanks who was just allowed to go off script and mess around with props left in the recording studio. And changes to the script were happening every day as Pixar literally made things up as they went along. This was where Buzz went through his ious incarnations – until they settled on the name and look we know so well. Director John Lasseter, who has since left Pixar after accusations of sexual misconduct, said: “My favourite colour is bright green and my we’s is purple. Just like she and I, they go really well together.” Woody was originally supposed to be a ventriloquist dummy, but producers said it was “creeping people out” and made the change to a lovable cowboy with his trademark pull-string.

Shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland. Images of of the aftermath show how warehouses and storage units surrounding the blast zone now lie in ruins. Rescue crews are still searching area in an attempt to retrieve bodies from homes flattened by the blast. Beirutaposs port - the epicentre of the explosion - was once one of the regionaposs busiest but has now been reduced to virtually nothing. Other satellite pictures show the Orient Queen cruise ship capsized due to the force of the blast Up to a quarter of a million people were left without homes fit to live in while the damage is expected to cost around bn . The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.  This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class, said Hassan Zaiter, , a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut. Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour. Some victims were hurled out to sea by the powerful blast. The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials reported that hospitals were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured. Beirutaposs Clemenceau Medical Center was like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lts, said Sara, one of its nurses. The explosion was the most powerful ever in Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections.The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about  milesaway. No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city, President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session. Aoun said , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, was stored for six years at the port after it was seized.The government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable, he said. An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of hazardous material.

CCTV footage shows the heroic woman slowly vacuum cleaning as the little girl wanders across the play area just before one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time. And within a matter of seconds, window blinds rock forwards before the glass windows burst into smithereens from the shockwave of the blast. But with an incredible piece of quick-thinking, the maid quickly leans over and grabs the girl and pulls her close to her chest. She abandons the cleaning and flees the room. More than  people - at least  - were killed in the huge blast which wrought devastation in the capital of Lebanon. The cataclysmic explosion, caused by , tons of ammonium nitrate, left , people injured and the city resembling a scrapyard of destroyed buildings. The explosion was a fth of the she size of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb and is thought to have been triggered by a fire was sparked by a welder. Shocking videos showed a huge mushroom cloud over the city. Lebanese rescue workers searched for survivors in the mangled wreckage of buildings and investigators today blamed negligence for the disaster.  Up to , were left without homes fit to live in after shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland. The death toll was expected to rise. The damage is thought to have spiralled to more than billion, with thousands left homeless. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said , tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures.  He declared a two-week state of emergency for Beirut and vowed the harshest punishments for those responsible. Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical commonly used in fertilisers and as an explosive for quarrying and mining. It is an oxidiser considered relatively safeuncontaminated and stored properly. But it is extremely dangerouscontaminated, mixed with fuel or stored unsafely. A large quantity of ammonium nitrate exposed to intense heat can trigger an explosion. Storing the chemical near large fuel tanks, in bulk in large quantities and in a poorly-ventilated facility could cause a massive blast. The larger the quantity, the more risk it will detonate.  On a scale, this explosion is scaled down from a nuclear bomb rather than up from a conventional bomb, said Roland Alford, managing director of Alford Technologies, a British company that specialises in disposal of explosive ordnance. This is probably up there among the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time. Experts have noted the colour of the smoke and mushroom cloud seen in footage of Tuesdayaposs blast as characteristic of ammonium nitrate explosions.Video footage of the incident show initial white-grey smoke followed by an explosion that released a large cloud of red-brown smoke and a large white aposmushroom cloudapos. These indicate that the gasses released are white ammonium nitrate fumes, toxic, red brown nitrous oxide and water, said Stewart Walker from the school of Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University. If you make ammonium nitrate explosive, you shouldnapost get that brown plume. That tells me the oxygen balance was not correct - so it wasnapost mixed as an explosive, he said. The Beirut blast looks like an accident, unless it was arson.  Some of the worldaposs deadliest industrial accidents were caused by ammonium nitrate explosions. In , an explosion of ammonium sulphate and nitrate fertiliser at the Oppau plant in Germany killed  people. In , a fire detonated around , tonnes of the chemical aboard a vessel in the U.S. port of Texas City, causing a tidal wave. At least  people were killed and more than , injured.  In Toulouse, France in , an explosion at an ammonium nitrate depot killed  and injured ,. Ammonium nitrate stored at a Texas fertiliser plant detonated in an explosion that killed  and injured about  in . In , explosions at a warehouse storing ammonium nitrate and other chemicals in the Chinese port of Tianjin killed at least  people.  Andrea Sella, professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Calornia, Los Angeles, said of the Beirut blast: The idea that such a quantity would have been left unattended for six years beggars belief, and was an accident waiting to happen. Ammonium nitrate can be mixed with other substances to make a bomb. It was used in Irish Republican Armybombings in London in the s, the  explosion that blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing  people, and the  blasts in Bali nightclubs in which more than  died.

A white-hot blastwave pulsed across the city, obliterating any building within a five-mile radius. Some , died immediately and the mushroom cloud rained deadly radioactivity on those left. Another , died of horric injuries within days. The bomb was called Little Boy – the world’s first atomic weapon. Three days later another atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. Setsuko Nakamura, , was arriving for her first day as a codebreaker with the army in Hiroshima on August th. Survivors of the world’s only atomic attacks are called “hibakushas” – “person affected by a bomb” – and there are just , left. Setsuko, now  and living in Canada, joined The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize for the group in . Here, she recounts what happened the day the world changed for ever... “It was Monday morning. We were on the second floor of the wooden building. The major was giving us a pep talk. At that moment I saw the bluest white flash outside and all around the building. “My body flew in the air. I was floating. I lost consciousness. I came to in total darkness. I couldn’t move. I was pinned under collapsed timbers and knew I was facing death. I was calm. I heard girls whispering. ‘Mother, help me, I am here’, ‘God help me’. Then a strong male voice told me, ‘Don’t give up. Keep moving, I am trying to free you, there is light ahead of you, crawl towards it.’ “I did and I escaped along with two other girls. I looked back and the building was on fire. About  girls with me in the room were burned alive. Outside, it was as dark as twilight.  “As my eyes adjusted, I saw a procession of human beings, they looked like ghosts. They were almost naked, their clothes in tatters, they were burned and blackened, swollen and bleeding, skin and flesh was coming off their bones. They were slowly shuffling from the centre of the city. Some people were carrying their eyeballs in the palms of their hands. Some fell and their stomachs burst open. Soldiers told us to join them and escape to a nearby hill. We walked over the bodies. “At the foot of the hill was a training field. It was packed with dead and dying. No one was screaming or crying. Just moans and whispers. Tens of thousands were begging for water. There was not a single doctor or nurse. The people were left there.  “With the other two girls, I worked all day trying to help. When darkness fell, we climbed the hill and I watched all night as huge balls of fire incinerated my hometown. My mind was empty. I sat there without any emotion watching the horror. Some envied the dead. To live in the aftermath was as hard or harder than dying. We were starving. There was no medical attention. The government was in chaos. “The next day people started to come from neighbouring cities, they tried to rescue survivors, started cremating the corpses. Those who came to assist started to get sick too. At that time, we had no idea what radiation would do. The rescuers became victims. I started losing my hair, there was internal bleeding.  “Before the bomb, about , other students from all the schools around were brought to the city to work. They died instantly, some vaporised. There were  from my school there. All those people were wiped from the Earth. “My own sister-in-law was a teacher supervising those students. We tried to find her body. We never did. The temperature was C. People melted. I lost nine two uncles, two aunts, two cousins, my sister-in-law, my sister and her four-year-old child. They survived the blast but were badly burned.  “My mother was rescued from a crushed building. My father was out of town fishing. From the boat, he saw the mushroom cloud. He got to where our house stood. It had been flattened. My parents found me and we went to look after my sister and her child. We spent days with them until they died. “The soldiers came, dug a hole, threw the bodies in, poured gasoline in and threw in a match. There was no human dignity. I watched without any feeling. I was stunned.

In a message to the the President of the Republic of Lebanon, Michel Aoun, Her majesty said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were deeply saddened by the news. The Queenaposs message to Mr Aoun said: Prince Philip and I were deeply saddened by news of the explosion at the Port in Beirut yesterday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who have been injured or lost their lives, and all those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected. At least  have been confirmed dead and more than , people injured.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Government is ready to provide support in any way we can, while the Foreign Office said it is monitoring the situation closely. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK stands in solidarity with Lebanon.My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the devastating explosion in Beirut today. The UK stands in solidarity with the people of Lebanon and is ready to offer help and support, including to those British nationals impacted, he said. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by , tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: The images of explosions in Beirut are deeply worrying. Our thoughts are with those affected, the emergency services and the people of Lebanon. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: All embassy staff are accounted for. A small number have sustained non-le-threatening injuries and, where necessary, are receiving medical attention. It is a fast-moving situation and we are monitoring the situation closely. We stand ready to offer consular support to British nationals affected. People should check FCO travel advice, which is updated regularly and includes contact details for those requiring consular assistance. Tory Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said the Government should offer the services of the UKaposs hospital ship, RFA Argus, to Lebanon.  In a tweet, he said: With Beirut hospitals overwhelmedthis asset should be part of our support offered to Lebanon. Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said the blast might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscated from a ship some time ago and stored at the port.But US President Donald Trump said US military generals had told him they seem to feel the explosion was the result of a terrible attack most likely caused by a bomb.It would seem like it based on the explosion, Mr Trump told reporters in Washington. Mr Gibb said the US President was premature to speculate.  The Lebanese government have announced that they are conducting an inquiry and we are ready to help support the Lebanese government with any technical support that they need, but this is a tragedy and the Lebanese authorities are, of course, investigating the cause of that tragedy and I think before we have the results of that inquiry, I think it is premature to speculate, he told Sky News.

Footage shows Dr Seblani, , who works in the US, smiling and looking radiant in her dress, but as photographer Mahmoud Nakib pans the camera down to a bouquet on the floor there is a deafening roar and the whole area shakes as the force of the blast blows the train on the wedding gown. The camera then shows a street that is filled with dust and debris as buildings fall apart and windows are blown out by the powerful shockwave that nearly blows the bride off her feet. Have you been affected by the explosion  Email webnews@mirror. Tuesdayaposs blast killed  people, injured more than , and left dozens missing as rescuers searched through mounds of rubble. Still in her wedding dress, Dr Seblani helped to check on the injured nearby, before fleeing central Beirutaposs Sai square to safety. Later, as she spoke to a Reuters journalist, she and her husband, a businessman in Beirut, were struggling to process what happened. She said: I have been preparing for my big day for two weeks and I was so happy like all other girls, aposI am getting marriedapos. My parents are going to be happy seeing me in a white dress, I will be looking like a princess.What happened during the explosion here - there is no word to explain ... I was shocked, I was wondering what happened, am I going to die  How am I going to die  Behind her, piles of smashed glass from the blown-out windows of the hotel where she was due to stay littered the ground, along with crushed remnants of flower arrangements that had adorned banquet tables. Dr Seblani arrived in Beirut three weeks earlier to prepare for her wedding. Mr Subeih recalled the aftermath of the blast, which officials have blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material - , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs - stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port. He said: We started to walk around and it was extremely sad, it was not describable the devastation and the sound of the explosion. We are still in shock ... I have never heard anything similar to the sound of this explosion. Dr Seblani added: I feel so sad about what happened to other people, about what happened to Lebanon. When I woke up [on Wednesday morning] and saw the damage that happened to Beirut, the one thing I said was thank God we are still alive.  After the blast, she and her husband tried to compose themselves and carry on with their celebrations. She said: My husband told me to continue, we canapost stop. I was like okay, why not, we continue. I was not living the moment actually, I was like walking, my face was smiling, my lips were smiling, thataposs it, not more. Then we went to have a dinner. Mr Subeih recalls entering the damaged hotel on Wednesday to retrieve belongings and passports. He said: The scene in the room was unbelievable.He is waiting for a visa to the United States so he can join his we there. Dr Seblani loves Lebanon, but feels that after Tuesdayaposs blast, living there is not an option. She is still trying to find joy in a wedding she took so long to prepare. The bride said: There is a lot of damage, many people were killed and wounded. But alsoI want to look at us, myself, my husband, the photographer - how we escaped unharmed, I thank God for protecting us."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/Gjen-Gavin-Piper-online-accordian_36021275-e1596644823916-940x564.jpg ","title":"accordion player from angus raises more than 1500 for charity with weekly online live music event","story":"An Angus accordionist#s virtual lockdown gigs have been music to the ears of a children#s charity, which received more than £, in donations.Letham man Gavin Piper is used to performing live, however, with concerts cancelled during the pandemic he decided to take his gigs online, like many in Tayside.And, mindful of the impact Covid- had on charities# funding, he decided to raise cash for Help for Kids, where his partner Derek Miller is a trustee.The -year-old performed a mix of ceilidh, classical and more modern tunes to the delight of fans of the squeezebox.He said: #It#s quite good.

It’s been a long time coming. I can’t wait to get started and meet all the boys.“Now I’m here I want to prove to the manager and prove to the team I can help the club get where they want to be.“I know the league well, I’ve done well in the league before and I can see myself doing well at a club like this. It’s a massive club and the players here are top quality so I’m really forward to getting going.”The -year-old came very close to joining James McPake’s men back in January, only for time to run out at the end of the transfer window.And he says knowing the Dens boss has been an admirer for some time helped make the decision to sign up for the Dee six months later.He added: “It was really close, just didn’t quite work out, but I’m here now and happy to be here.“I think it’s half the battle being at a club that the manager likes you.”Mullen, who will wear the number nine jersey, will already have won over some fans after his play-off goal helped keep the Buddies in the Premiership at the end of season - at the expense of local rivals Dundee United.Meanwhile, former Dens loan ace Christophe Berra insists he is ready to revive his Hearts career after being unceremoniously axed by former boss Daniel Stendel.Berra, , remains baffled by the German’s decision to strip him of the captaincy and farm him out on loan to Dundee in January, emphasising that he was willing to fight for his place.He was excellent for James McPake’s side, who kept five clean sheets in six games featuring the veteran stopper.But Berra will go up against Dee with the Jambos in the Championship this season after reporting back for duty following the shutdown with renewed confidence.The defender, who is contracted to Hearts until next summer, is determined to battle his way into the plans of ing head coach Robbie Neilson, his ex-Tynecastle team-mate, and prove that age is no barrier.Reflecting on his enforced exile, Berra told the BBC: “I could understandI was a bad egg but I’m not.“I was happy to stay and fight for my place but the manager came in and you’ve got to respect his decision.“I went to Dundee and, looking back, that was a great thing for me. I played in six games, undefeated, kept five clean sheets and enjoyed my football.“I know I can still play at a good level. I don’t care about age #you are learning every day, putting in the sht and performing well then you can play far beyond your years.“I’ll do my utmost in training and, come the first game of the season,the manager decides to pick me, then great.“There are no guarantees in football no matter who you are. It’ll be down to me, in terms of how I perform in training and pre-season games.”Dundee and Hearts go head to head at Tynecastle on October , the Championship’s opening day, and Berra acknowledges the capital club are favourites for the title.However, he warned against anything approaching complacency.Berra added: “We have expectations as a club and, there’s not point hiding it, everyone expects us to go up.#We’re the hot favourites but in football, and sport in general, you need to earn the right to go up.“Every team we play against will be trying their hardest # and there are good teams down there good players.

It will be many months before we can open our venues again and it will be a challenge to get back on our feet next year but this funding is a leline.”And a spokeswoman from The Barn said the cash would help secure jobs.She said: “We’re grateful and relieved to receive support from the Performing Arts Venues Relief Fund, which will help to safeguard our organisation until March .#As a result, we will ensure we have key staff in place to work on a sustainable future for the Barn and vital projects that will contribute to the health and well being of our audiences, networks, and communities.#This includes providing recovery support for vulnerable iniduals, who have been shielding away from cultural services for many months.“Covid- will have a long-lasting impact on the ecology of the arts sector, and over the coming months, The Barn will work with artists towards more erse modes of activity and will develop new ways of being creative together. It is our hope that this relief support funding will enable us to move towards a prolic period of creative activity which will deeply consider, develop and enhance the well being of people and the planet.”Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop described theatres and art venues to be #vital# for communities.She said: #Our performing arts venues effectively had to close overnight, with an almost complete loss of income. There is no doubt that in doing so they saved lives, and for that I am extremely grateful.“We know the impact of this crisis will be long-term so ambitious action to support the future of these organisations, as well as our wider cultural infrastructure, is key. This funding will be a vital leline to help performing arts venues continue to weather the storm.”And Iain Munro, CEO of Creative Scotland said: #There are signicant challenges facing Scotland’s culture sector, due to the ongoing Covid- pandemic. This funding for performing arts venues is much needed and will help organisations tackle these challenges but we are aware that budgets are finite and it is not possible to provide financial assistance to every organisation through this route at this time.“The Covid- emergency funds announced for the culture sector so far are not, by any means, the end of the support to be offered and there will be more announcements to come, not least in terms of how the £m Scotland has received for culture and heritage as a result of the UK Government’s funding package is to be applied.  The precise nature of this is still being determined and, beyond what has already been made available, Creative Scotland is working closely with the Scottish Government to actively discuss further support for the culture sector, including for those who may not have received funding previously.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn.From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there are a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities.No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities.The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes.You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks.Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit.NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe.Visit visitbritain know-before-you-go to learn more about heading outdoors safely.Walking in Scotland means mighty mountains to conquer, plenty of forest paths or coastal walks to meander along, charming villages to discover, and exciting city routes to explore.Whether you’d like to enjoy a walking holiday, or simply an afternoon’s amble, you’re definitely in the right place when you are in Scotland.  What are you waiting for It’s time to explore one of Scotland’s best assets – the great outdoors Scotland’s Great Trails, such as the West Highland Way, the Great Glen Way, Fe Coastal Path and the Southern Upland Way are among the best walking routes in the world for experienced hikers and take you through some outstanding scenery.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

Even harder to square though is the way its structured chunky paragraphs alternately flit back and forth in time, not in a way thats disorientating, but in a way that slows and halts proceedings frustratingly. This is hampered further by the y inclusion of song lyrics - which you may find yourself skim reading...

I was hooked straight away by the topics writer and broadcaster Emma Gannon covers in Olive, her first foray into fiction particularly, how its still a taboo for a woman to say she doesnt want children. The story follows the eponymous character and her three best friends, Isla, Cecily and Bea. Moving between their s and present-day - as they navigate their early s - we see how their lives have taken very dferent paths. Gannons characters feel comfortingly familiar, and their ious struggles many women will be able to identy with. I loved the exploration of how messy friendships can get, and how much warmth, empathy, and understanding Gannon displays throughout. My only criticism would be some plot developments felt a little rushed, the writing a little hurried. However, that doesnt take away from how enjoyable it is the fact I devoured it in one weekend says it all.GEORGIA HUMPHRIESIf I Had Your Face  by Frances Cha is published in paperback by Viking, priced pound. .If I Had Your Face is the debut novel from Frances Cha, which follows four women who live in the same apartment block in Seoul, South Korea. All of them placing unrealistic expectations of beauty, success and romance upon themselves. Plastic surgery devotee, Kyuri, works as a room salon girl where she entertains the ludicrously wealthy men of the city, Miho is an artist with connections to the upper echelons of Korean society, K-Pop obsessed mute, Ara, is a hairdresser and their pregnant neighbour, while Wonna, is stuck in an uninspiring and underpaid office job with fears over how she will afford to be a mother. Each chapter alternates between the four protagonists, told in the first person, the trouble is I had a hard time distinguishing whose voice I was hearing. All of them are struggling to get by in modern day Korea a place where birth, marriage and unemployment rates are at an all-time low. They are looking for a le as far away from their disadvantaged beginnings as possible and the s they are willing to go to achieve that are ruthless. The book ends a little prematurely and with multiple loose ends left hanging. Ultimately, this is an entertaining book you wont struggle to get through, but it might leave you feeling slightly unsatisfied.FRANCES WRIGHTThe Hungover Games by Sophie Heawood is published in hardback by Jonathan Cape, priced pound. Unexpectedly pregnant in Los Angeles, where she has been living in a bubble as a celebrity journalist, Sophie Heawood s to the UK to have the baby she had not planned for. What follows next is a frank memoir about shedding ones old le to nurture another, trying to date and hold down a freelance career while bringing up a newborn, with a few big-name interviews thrown in along the way. The brutal precision in which she describes prolonged singledom is so accurate it leaves the reader winded the love for her daughter, sublime. This is in turns gorgeous, unflinching, tender, sad, affirming and cackle-worthy. You dont need to be a mother, have one in your le or hope to become one, for the razor-sharp observations chronicled here to ring true.JEMMA CREWChildrens book of the weekThe Wild Way Home by Sophie Kirtley is published in hardback by Bloomsbury Childrens Books, priced pound. Sophie Kirtleys debut is a thoughtful and gentle musing on how to cope with change, and control the feeling of fear when it floods your system. Its Charlie Merriams th birthday, and his new little brother Dara has just arrived, but the baby is poorly, and Charlie doesnt know how to love him just yet. So, Charlie runs away to the forest, where he and his friends have built a whole world of their own. Except this time, the forest feels and looks dferent - and then Charlie finds a boy in animal skins face down in a stream. There are broad echoes of David Almonds Kits Wilderness, but The Wild Way Home is not so darkly complex and tangled. Charlies adventures lack a certain amount of peril, while the lives of those he encounters in this ancient version of his forest could do with more fleshing out. However, its a solid story about facing what terries you, feeling your feelingsand protecting the ones you love. Plus, it will make you desperate to get out into the forest.ELLA WALKER"},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-sensual-moving-daring-little-birds-feels-different-anything-else-tv","story":"\"They really affected me, and woke a sexual sort of fire that I didnt know I had\",\" notes the London-born star, who grew up in Somerset, and has been acting since she was a young teenager.Now,  years later, the quirky actress is playing the lead role - New York heiress Lucy Savage - in Sky Atlantics adaptation of Nins book.\"I made a lot of notes of little things that I wanted to add into the script, trying to get actual one-liner direct quotes from Little Birds, and I got a couple of them in there, which was really exciting,\" reflects Temple, star of films such as Atonement, St Trinians and Maleficent, plus Netflix series Dirty John.\"That was cool that everyone was open to me doing that.\"Little Birds is a six-part series, written by Sophia Al-Maria - an American-Qatari filmmaker and artist - and directed by Detroit-born Stacie Passon, whose previous projects include House Of Cards.When her husband Hugo does not greet her in the way she expected, she finds herself on a journey to freedom and independence.We see Lucy discovering the surprising, erse and degenerate world of Tangier, in Morocco, a country quivering on the cusp of independence. Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s...

But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"five-best-new-cars-towing-caravan","story":"Whether its a caravan, boat or trailer ndash or anything  in-between ndash having the right car for the job is essential when it comes to towing.Here, weve taken into account the maximum braked trailer towing capacity. However, always check both the kerbweight of the car youre using to tow with, as well as the weight of the caravan. For safe towing, its usually recommended to only pull a caravan which weighs % of the tow cars total kerbweight. Be extremely carefultowing a caravan which exceeds this % rule.Weve been through the latest models, to see which cars are the very best for towing. Lets take a look.... Volvo XC DVolvos stylish XC won the Towcar of the Year award for , so its only fitting that it kicks this list off. Capable of towing up to ,kg of braked trailer, the XC is just as practical as it is good-looking.An optional retractable towbar means you dont need to disturb the cars clean lines when youre not hauling, while the interiors solid fit and finish should mean its up to the task for any adventure. It isnt overly large either, which means that when not towing, its relatively easy to park and position.. Volkswagen TouaregThe Volkswagen Touareg is a big, luxurious, high-riding SUV, which is capable of wolfing up hundreds of miles without a moments hesitation. It also - handily enough for this list - is excellent at towing.Its able to tow up to ,kg of braked trailer, and a silky-smooth turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine makes it a refined way of getting about.. Jaguar I-PaceIf youre looking to tow, then an electric vehicle might not immediately spring to mind. However, Jaguars I-Pace was designed to be capable of towing from the off, putting it in line with the firms go-anywhere mentality.As a result, itll tow up to kg. Well admit that its certainly on the lighter end of the scale, but its still admirable from an EV.. Skoda KodiaqThe Kodiaq is an excellent, well-valued choice in the seven-seater segment. Not only is it immensely practical but its also well priced, packing plenty of on-board technology and a vast suite of standard equipment.Plus, a .-litre turbocharged engine helps the Kodiaq to deliver a braked towing capacity of ,kg. Despite this load-lugging ability, the Kodiaq CO emissions are impressively low - just g km.. Land Rover DiscoveryThe Land Rover Discovery is a mammoth of the road, providing a luxurious, high-end driving experience for all on board. Its also packed with off-road technology and a iety of features which help it to keep going even when things get tough.Its impressive when it comes to towing too, thanks to a braked trailer rating of up to ,kg - which means its got more than enough pulling power for most occasions.Jack Evans"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The unanswerable question for every Scottish Tory leader","story":"Few voters outside Moray know who Douglas Ross is. Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-catalogue-bygone-era-ends-publication","story":"Itrsquos historic Argos has published the bumper catalogue twice a year since the store was formed in , with a spring summer edition released in January and an autumn winter edition traditionally published in July.It was a lsquomust-haversquo item in itself At its peak, the Argos catalogue was Europersquos most widely printed publication, found in three quarters of homes in the UK.

Moreover, evenher followers are correct,she were to be hit by the proverbial bus, who would Scotland be left with The hopeless Humza Yousaf, with a conviction that makes him uniquely unfit to be either Transport or Justice Secretary  Or John Swinney, a husk of a man whose judgment is so poor on schools reopening that it had to be over-ruled within days  Likewise, Jeane Freeman, who shares the blame for Scotlandrsquos care home deaths and is apparently deemed incapable of representing her own policies at the daily televised NicolaFest  Or do we go back to sleazy Derek Mackay, the disgraced ex-heir apparent Or do we fall back on Alex Salmond, the man promoted and supported for decades by the very same Ms Sturgeon, whose conduct around women led to him being described in court by his own defence counsel as ldquonot a good man The First Ministerrsquos dominance is in fact a mark of how devolution has diminished Scottish politics ndash there is no doubt that she would have been reduced to a figure of ridicule by John Smith, or that Robin Cook would have torn her playhouse down, room by room by roomFurthermore, her threadbare party ndash the SNP ndash is symptomatic of the shallow talent pool that is Holyrood. She and they have no blueprint for a better future outside the UK, and we can have no confidence whatsoever that they could or would make an independent Scotland a better place.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.JOHN Findlay contends that Nicola Sturgeon has no confidence in allowing her Cabinet colleagues to deliver the daily Covid- update, but Mr Findlay would appear to have no confidence in the public, when he writes that \"convince a gullible public she has performed really well dealing with Covid- and that should be sufficient for them to vote for independence\". Mr Findlay goes on to state that many of the SNPs policies have failed since taking office. Presumably he also blames the gullible public for ing the SNP to Holyrood three consecutive times, andthe opinion polls are correct it will be back for a fourth term next May. However, I seem to recall that before the SNP came to power I had to pay over the counter for my medical prescriptions and pay to cross a bridge when visiting my friends in Fe. Amongst many other achievements, the SNP has provided baby boxes to help parents give their children a good start in le, extended quality childcare provision, upgraded nearly a thousand schools, provided free university education, built thousands of affordable homes for families, and provided free personal care when required, regardless of age.As for Mr Findlays contention that an independent Scotland would have no influence in the world compared to that of the UK, I would suggest that the UKs standing in the world has slumped due to leaving the European Union, a decision which was soundly rejected by Scotlands voters.

Can we please end this arrant nonsense For example, since , Scotland has raised more than pound billion in tax receipts for the UK Treasury, of which Westminster has retained poundbn. In fact, every UK government in our letimes has knowingly erted tens of billions of pounds of Scottish revenues to Westminster.

The MP for Moray has even less public profile than Mr Carlaw, who at least was known for selling cars.You wonder how long the party can survive this before it lapses into historical irrelevance. Of course, the Scottish Tory Party will always be kept alive by its umbilical relationship with the UK Conservatives. A relationship which is both its salvation and its curse.Murdo Fraser MSP, the former deputy Tory leader, wisely realised this after the  referendum and proposed a breakaway Scottish party, like the Canadian Liberals or the Baian CDU. But it ainrsquot gonna happen ndash certainly not under Mr Ross, who appears to want to continue banging away at the old dead Union themes.That no one is listening should be evident to everyone who looks at the opinion polls or talks to Scottish voters. A line has been crossed since Brexit. The Union as it is now is no longer viable. It has become a focus of discontent as Scotland is shoe-horned into a new UK internal market replacing the EU single market.There is another way. Over the past couple of years there has been talk in Unionist circles of a new Act of Union to cement the new post-Brexit relationship. The Prime Minister is thought to be interested in something dramatic that would redefine relationships in this ldquoawesome foursome, as he calls Britain.The unionist columnist Stephen Daisley put flesh on the bones in an article this week. This new Act of Union would, in his model, restore the sovereignty of Westminster in a unitary UK state. It would define what the powers of the Scottish Parliament are, instead of leaving them open-ended as is the case in the  Scotland Act.ldquoBring it on, says Nicola Sturgeon. On the face of it, this would seem like the ultimate power grab ndash abandoning all pretence that the Scottish Parliament is anything other than a talking shop, a unit of local government, Strathclyde Region writ large.And yet, there could be something in this New Union ideaturned upside down and used to recognise not subordination, but Scottish autonomy. It could even come in the form of a new Treaty of Union, as in , to embrace a new constitutional reality.Such a treaty would recognise that Scotland and England still want to be part of Great Britain, as it also said in . But it would start from the premise that Scotland is a country in its own right. That Scotland voluntarily relinquished its sovereignty in , but now intends to run its own affairs in a new legal partnership.This New Union would recognise that Scotlandrsquos Parliament exercises entrenched constitutional powers: something that was promised in the post-ldquoVow Scotland Act in , but wasnrsquot delivered, as the Supreme Court ruled in .This New Union would be regarded by diehard unionistas a capitulation: not so much an Act of Union as an Act of Disunion. However, it could also be the creation of a new Union of equals ndash one that draws on the past but recognises changed realities.Like the European Union, this Union would be a legally-binding partnership of nominally independent countries. It would be defined by a commitment to common economic, social and environmental objectives, free movement, human rights, common trading standards, mutual defence and a common currency.Giving Holyrood full economic powers, including tax and borrowing, but within the confines of a common currency, would keep Scotland within the tent, much as countries like Slovakia and Slovenia are within the European Union. They are both sovereign countries, but their currency is the euro, they obey the Maastricht stability rules on debt and accept Brusselsrsquo right to regulate trade and negotiate treaties on their behalf.Scotland would be in charge of most of its own affairs, but would remain part of a United Kingdom under the Queen. That this echoes  Independence White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Future, drafted by one Nicola Sturgeon, is no accident. That was not a prospectus for separation, but for confederalism, as some of us argued at the time.After all, what does Westminster really need from Scotland  It needs a common travel area, a viable internal market, a common currency, defence and mutual security. Thatrsquos really it. England doesnrsquot need the hassle and expense of the day-to-day running of Scotland it just needs a recognition that Great Britain still exists as a geopolitical entity and that the UK is a unitary economic space ndash just like the EU.This kind of relationship would make sense following Brexit. Scotland would cease to be a Barnett supplicant. The Scottish Government would have to take responsibility for managing economic affairs within the constraints of legally-binding Treaty obligations.I think Dominic Cummings would be all over this. I think Sir Keir Starmer might be too. A new Union that saves Britain from Balkanisation and emphasises solidarity and common interests would be supported by the Liberal Democrats.Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Ms Sturgeon might see some merit in an Act of Disunion. It gets her off the referendum hook and would allow her to claim that Scotland was becoming independent, not by conflict and disruption as in Catalonia, but through reasoned discussion and negotiation.At any rate, something has to be done. Britain finally leaves Europe in the New Year ndash just in time for the Holyrood elections, which promise to be a blood bath for the unionist parties. Boris Johnson canrsquot just pretend itrsquos business as usual. Offering more cash backed by dark threats wonrsquot wash.Scotland needs to be sorted so he can concentrate on Brexit. If and when the SNP wins a majority in Mayrsquos Scottish elections, the Prime Minister should show true Churchillian radicalism by offering his own Plan B ndash challenging Scotland to join a new partnership of equals.

For anyone reading from outside the UK, this is the system by which a Prime Minister can select anyone he wishes to be placed into the upper house of the UKrsquos legislature to play an important role in making the laws that govern us all, and frequently to become a government minister, unanswerable to the elected members of the House of Commons. Yes, you read all of that correctly.Most of the attention last week, as has become customary after the announcement of honours lists, was on the identity of the newly ennobled. The fire and fury focussed on the placement of brothers, husbands of former Prime Ministers and sons of former KGB agents, and, of course, a certain former leader of the Scottish Conservatives Party. All of this is, I suppose, an inevitable consequence of the relationship between politics and media.However the identity of the ennobled is simply a consequence of the ability to ennoble, and it is the latter which should be the focus. Through the eyes of a democrat, the red benches of the House of Lords, with now over  unelected members, should sit uncomfortably side-by-side with the green benches of the  elected members in the House of Commons.The existence of this large,  percent unelected legislature does not place us in great company. It is dficult to find a democracy with a legislative chamber which has no elected members in it. Locating such a thing in an autocracy is far easier, with Russia and Saudi Arabia being unfortunate examples.Defenders of the House of Lords offer some perfectly well-intentioned and important arguments in favour of the red benches, primarily revolving around its central role as a reviser of legislation. They have a point the quality of the work done by Lords in committees can often be very high, and a welcome correction on the legislation created by MPs, the quality of which can often be very low.However whilst these defenders have a point, they miss the point, which is about democracy. They may be of high quality, in some cases, but the fact that the people over whom they preside have not placed them in their position at the ballot box is an overriding factor. And, I must say, I find it impossible to equate being a democrat to defending the existence of the House of Lords.Or, at least, the existence of the Lords as it is currently composed. Our country is in a state of great change brought on by the actual and potential constitutional changes of Brexit and nationalism respectively, and in these times of great chaos we must seize great opportunity.Major constitutional changes should come only after vaulting an extremely high barrier. We must take care to ensure that enduring change is not implemented on a whim, or as a result of the fashion of a snapshot in time. Virtue signalling has no place in decisions of this gravity.However, conversely, we should not be afraid to change something which is archaic out of  respect for its age and stature. And the House of Lords surely now finds itself in this position.Mr Johnson, whether he likes it or not, isof massive constitutional change. Brexit. Scottish independence. There is surely an argument to exploit this flux and become the proactiveof a change to the Lords . He could lay out a roadmap for the gradual increase in the election of members to the upper chamber, probably via some form of proportional representation, with a backstop date at which  per cent of members will be elected.We will hear, of course, that the public donrsquot want more politicians, donrsquot want more elections, but that is, Irsquom afraid, a deliberate distraction from the real issue. The politicians are already there. Their cost is a teaspoon in the ocean, relatively speaking. Andthe public really doesnrsquot want another set of elections, then they neednrsquot bother voting. But democracy demands that they at least have the choice.The UK is not the only jurisdiction which needs to consider what to do with the body responsible for revising legislation. Scotland has its own problems in this respect, however they come from the other end of the scale.The Scottish Parliament is unicameral, with the job of revising legislation sitting with MSPs in committees. Initially considered to be the jewel in the crown of Holyrood, the committee system has over the last two decades been exposed as at best weak, at worst a tool of government.This deficiency was acknowledged by the Commission for Parliamentary Reform in its recent self-styled lsquoMoTrsquo, however the remit of that review reflected a lack of the courage required to make the more major changes which the institution probably needs.One of those may well be a Senate to act as a more independent, stronger and better reviser of legislation, particularly since the Additional Member System of electing MSPs, designed to create coalition government, has been shown to be breakable.The ongoing Scottish Government hate crimes legislation may well be another case study for the benefits of a revising chamber this is not the first time that respected outside bodies have raised the prospect of damaging unintended consequences of badly drafted legislation, as the Law Society for Scotland have done in this instance.Changing Westminster is devilishly dficult its age and history makes unwinding convention a complicated matter. The same is not the case here in Scotland. Our institutions are young, and ripe for tinkering until we can get as close to perfection as possible.

For the countryrsquos exam regulator, and by extension the Scottish Government, have made a right porcus auris of matters .To recap. With exams cancelled for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was left to teachers to estimate the grades a pupil could expect, and then the SQA would step in to moderate the result up or down. Not ideal, but this was an unprecedented situation, best that could be done in the circumstances, good intentions all round, autofill as required.Yet from the outset the most important part of the process, the moderation of results, was shrouded in mystery, like the recipe for some secret sauce. MSPs, teachers and others had asked for details of the methodology to be used, but details came there none until the day the results were published, when it was too late to do anything about it.As it turned out, the SQA has been less than moderate in its moderation, with a quarter of results, some ,, downgraded.Digging deeper, pupils from the most deprived areas were more likely to have their grades downgraded than those from the least deprived areas. Among the latter the dference between estimated and actual results was . per cent. In the most deprived areas it was .%.In making its decisions, the SQA considered a schoolrsquos past results. It was not the only consideration but it was key. So it did not matter how hard a pupil had worked all year, and what their teacherrsquos assessment was: the fix was in from the start. Postcode determined outcome, and once the downgrading began one domino toppled on to the next, right down to a predicted pass becoming a fail.As Lindsay Paterson, Professor of Education Policy at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in The Herald: ldquoItrsquos bad enough to know that you have been given a B instead of an A because of what previous students achieved in your school.ldquoBut to know you have failed a course because the SQA judged your teachers to be unreliable in making judgments is offensive.: Fears teachers will be overwhelmed by appealsOffence has duly been taken by pupils, their parents, and teachers alike, and no wonder. Once again, those Scots youngsters most in need of a fair shake have been shoved to the back of the queue through no fault of their own. All in the name, in the words of the SQA, of \"maintaining the integrity of the system.Had the results gone unmoderated, we are told by ministers, the pass rates would have risen to the highest on record. We could not have that, right  If pupils from poorer backgrounds genuinely began catching up with those from better-off areas then why shell out for private school fees  Andwe start down that road where will it all end Well, we could end up with an approach to Scottish education that was more in keeping with reality than the rose-tinted, wharsquos like us nonsense we traditionally feed ourselves.

There, you will learn that the SQA is ldquothe heart of Scotlandrsquos world-renowned education system.Would this be the same world-renowned education system that has seen Scotland fall down the international Pisa rankings in maths and science and struggle to keep up in reading We also learn that the SQA offers ldquoglobally recognised qualications and services to realise your potential.

There was the U-turn over plans for a partialto school, and now fresh turmoil caused by the SQArsquos downgrading of results.It has been a tough time for a lot of people, parents especially, but the answer does not lie in piling unfairness on to existing inequality, as the SQArsquos downgrading has done.Its next task is dealing with the thousands of expected appeals. On that the SQA should do what it promised in the first place and properly consult teachers.Instead of viewing teachers as biased towards their own pupils, think of them as professional observers whose opinions are as worthy of respect as your own.The Government needs to take a grip of the situation and fast, not just for the sake of current pupils but those that come after. It is possible, in the absence of a vaccine, that we could be in the same situation next year.The Scottish education system cannot take any more dunts to its reputation. It has nothing to do with some notion of national pride. It is about being serious when we say we believe in fairness and equality.

The problem here is that moderation and averages swamp iniduals, whether across a qualication cohort or a whole school. The SQA is wide-open for criticism, but it has profiled a set of awards reflecting the disparities in the Scottish schooling system. An examination diet describes the situation. On no account can it be used to change it.How might this have been avoided  The SQA should have set out its protocols of previous school performance and made it clear that an enhanced profile for any pupil would require substantiating evidence. This could have been about the school as well as the inidual pupil. As other politicians have pointed out with alacrity, the SQArsquos historical assumptions have locked-in bias and perceived unfairness. These two protocols would have avoided unsubstantiated over-claiming by teachers and would have prevented likely exceptional inidual performance being lost in the crowd.But there is a lot more to this story than simply the alleged bureaucratic and methodological bungling of the SQA. Changing the attainment profile in Scotland is a much bigger issue involving educational priorities, capacityand associated resourcing. The SQA takes a kicking while the Government looks on.Professor William Wardle, Glasgow G.IT is perhaps understandable why the SQA had to downgrade some of the teacher judgments. From looking at the pass rates,teachersrsquo estimates were accepted en masse, the following unacceptable student grades would have resulted:National  ndash Up from . per cent in  to .% in , according to teacher estimates. An increase of .%. Higher. Up from .% in  to .% in . An amazing estimated increase of %. .Advanced Higher. Up from .% in  to .% in  using teacher estimates. An increase of .%.Even the final grades awarded resulted in the largest percentage rise in exam passes in recent memory.Teachers, understandably, wanted the best for their students, but in doing so, ignored the statistics of their previous yearrsquos school results.This overestimation could, in some cases, have resulted in genuine passes being overturned as inidual pupil performance could not be taken into account ndash ie, the whole cohort was downgraded.The sad fact is that the downgrading of pupilsrsquo results in the poorer areas was double that of the better-off areas.It was an almost impossible job for the SQA to have got right, but hopefully the appeals system will help.Tom Strang, Former PT Maths, Barrhead.THERE is much discontent with the way in which school assessments have been carried out in this peculiar year. Normally, these would have concluded with examinations, but this year coursework and teacher assessments are what has counted ndash until the SQA intervened. It is unfortunate that Scottish youngsters do not have the same opportunity as those in England will have to demonstrate their ability in exams. For decades, there has been criticism of exams, while \"continuous assessment\" has been favoured. It is true that exams are a throw of the dice on a specic day when some candidates may be out of sorts for one reason or another. Yet continuous assessment puts pressure on them over a y period, and puts pressure on markers to give good grades because the coursework counts towards the final grade. This allows little room for getting it wrong first time and then learning from that.Exams have a iety of advantages. First, apart from any attempts at impersonation, we know who has done the work, with all candidates under the same controlled conditions. Who knows how much \"help\" candidates have had with essays or projects completed at home  Second, ostensibly paradoxically, markers in national exams do not know who has done the work because the candidatesrsquo names mean nothing to them. Where candidates are known to markers, their papers can be anonymised. Third, exams provide a good discipline in being time-limited. Completing a task in a set time is a transferable skill, appreciated by employers. Fourth, under pressure of time, candidates are required to think on their feet , which is another transferable skill appreciated by employers.Instead, this year Scottish pupils are at the mercy of the SQArsquos statistical models. No doubt the SQA has produced an algorithm to guide it.

especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona - just skyrocketing in that demographic.ldquoItrsquos just that smouldering fire - but as more of them get infected, the chance of them interacting with the vulnerable population increases and hits that vulnerable population, and then the inferno just begins.ldquoThatrsquos when we end up with lots of sickness and lots of disease.The problem for politicians and public health experts is how to persuade a vast swathe of the population to take the threat of coronavirus seriously when, in reality, they are extremely unlikely to become critically unwell, let alone die.According to a study by experts in epidemiology and infectious disease at Stanford University, the risk of someone under  dying in the UK from Covid was equivalent to the chances of them dying in a car crash - but onlythey drove  miles every day.Across Europe and Canada, depending on their age and where they lived, under-s were between  and -times less likely to die from the virus than those over .The large majority of the deaths that do occur in this \"non-elderly\" population are among people with other underlying conditions, such as severe asthma, kidney failure, or diabetes, or who have immune deficiencies.: Cause for alarm as Covid hospital admissions rise in ScotlandIn Scotland, based on death certicates, there have been just  Covid deathsamong those aged  to , and none in anyone younger.The incidence of Covid-related intensive care admissions in the  to  age group in Scotland is . per ,, compared to . for those aged  to .As the authors of the Stanford University study state: ldquoFor healthy non-elderly people, the risk of dying from Covid- in the first half of  was very small.\"This is in stark contrast with many news stories that focus on the demise of young people and the panic and horror that these widely reverberated stories are causing...no matter what strategy is selected for addressing COVID- in the current or future epidemic waves, it should include special emphasis in protecting very elderly iniduals.And theres the rub: the more young people - who are nonetheless equally capable of catching and spreading the infection, often without symptoms - flout the rules, the more cases will increase, and the more chance there is of the virus eventually reaching people who will get sick.But it is very challenging psychologically to link apparently harmless behaviour, such as sitting too close to too many people in a pub, to the potential to set off a chain of events that could culminate in a strangers hospitalisation.ldquoItrsquos about our risk to others, and that might make it a little more dficult to understand, says Cynthia Rohrbeck, an associate professor in clinical and community psychology at George Washington University.: Warning over surgery backlog as around , operations postponedHuman judgment is also clouded by optimism bias: the tendency to believe you are less likely than others to experience something negative.In February, researchers polled , people in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and found half of them believed they were less likely to get the coronavirus than others, without any sound evidence for that belief.Our behaviour is also governed by the reward principle: put simply, we are more likely to follow the ruleswe perceive a personal reward, or benefit, to our actions.Not getting sick might be a reward - butyou already know that the statistics are stacked in your favour and, as time goes on, you dont fall ill, the motivation to comply flags.In trying to keep a lid on the pandemic as lockdown eases, we essentially face an uphill battle against human psychology.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study.

Aquaculture businesses have also raised concerns about the project#s impact on its operations near the coastal connection in Shetland.The project consists of a substation at Kergord, which is required for the connection of renewable electricity generators on Shetland.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Shielding was also paused for around , vulnerable people here last week.Read More Reopen all pubs or lose thousands of jobs and hundreds of bars: warning IT company Neueda creates  NI jobs amid £m investmentOwen Reidy, Assistant General Secretary for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions , said it was likely the job retention scheme here could be needed until at least .I think things are a lot more nuanced here in Northern Ireland. We would argue that where people can work from home they should.What we#re seeing now is a mix, and good employers are engaging with unions and giving workers choice especially over the summer months.He said it was crucial for employers to negotiate with their unions and draw up working from home policies.For us the new normal should be giving workers a range of options. Some medium companies may also be able to adjust their rentsthey have more people working from home.Where there are good industrial relations these things can happen.He welcomed that the Economy Minister Diane Dodds was promoting a working together document, which was drawn up with input from trade unions and employers earlier this year.It#s quite black and white about what has to happen which is good as there are lots of workers who are particularly anxious about ing to work and feeling vulnerable.On extending the job retention scheme beyond October for those who are shielding and can#t work from home, he said: I think it does need to be kept, and I think you#re seeing an argument in the developed world that these schemes will need to be kept for a number of months and possibly into  and kept under review.We need to avoid redundancies where possible, andwe can furlough people the connection with the employer and the workplace remains.Redundancy is incredibly damaging for those people and their families trying to maintain their living standards.It#s also a loss of revenue for the state coming through the tax system.A spokesperson for the Department for the Economy said the Executive#s recovery plan included the steps for ing to work.Working from home will be the new normal for many employees and businesses, they said. Others will already be back in their workplaces because of their business needs or personal circumstances. Some people may now be moving to a hybrid of working from home and the office. Employees and employers need to find arrangements that suit their needs in safe workplaces. These decisions will be inidual to businesses, workplaces and employees.The spokesperson added: The Minister for the Economy has visited businesses in Northern Ireland to see how this practical guide can be applied to workplaces, and has seen the impact that the collapse in footfall is having in our town and city centres. Large numbers of workers across Northern Ireland are still working from home, including around , civil servants and thousands of workers in the IT sector.While the Northern Ireland Civil Service yesterday said it had no up-to-date figures on the percentage of its staff who have ed to offices, in June it revealed that just over half were at home.In response to an Assembly Question, the Finance Minister Conor Murphy said that % of the NICS#s workforce of , were working from home. It#s understood that number has fluctuated since.Allstate, one of Northern Ireland#s biggest employers in the IT sector, has said it moved quickly to set up its , staff to work from home. And they said staff - who usually work from offices in Belfast, Strabane and Derry - would stay at home until the end of the year.The company said: As Allstate thinks about a phasedto the office the company will follow all government guidelines and the safety of our employees is our priority. Ulster Bank said that while branches had stayed open during lockdown, office-based staff in its headquarters at Donegall Square were working from home and would remain there into .Danske Bank said it was starting to bring staff back to its head office, also in Donegall Square in Belfast.Danske Bank has had a large number of staff working from its physical locations right throughout the crisis, including keeping all  of its branches and its contact centre fully operational. A phasedfor all head office staff in central Belfast is planned over the coming weeks.Novosco, an IT firm based in Catalyst Inc in Titanic Quarter, told BBC Radio Ulster that it#s now giving staff the option of coming in. Susan Hill told Radio Ulster that the decision followed a survey which found that around one third of its workers wanted back in the office.Meanwhile, business advisory firm PwC told the BBC that around  of over , staff were now back in its Belfast offices.

Photo credit should read: Niall Carson PA Wire PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJohn Hume Junior speaks at the funeral of his father John Hume at St Eugene#s Cathedral in Londonderry. PA Photo. August   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFirst of all I would like to say a word to my brother Aidan who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to Coronavirus restrictions.Aidan, Gail and their five kids are watching us from Marshfield. Massachusetts.I would also like to mention Aine and Kevin’s daughter, Roisin, John’s granddaughter, in Vancouver where she is watching in the middle of the night.You may not be with us in person, but we know you are here, as does dad.Summing up our dad’s le in a few minutes is not an easy task.For a man who supposedly had only one single transferable speech, dad did a lot of dferent things in his le.He also made us laugh, dream, think, and sometimes look at him and scratch our heads in amazement .He also kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years. Yorkies, Crunchies, creme eggs, Double Deckers, Wispas, you name it, he loved them all.We often found it odd, how a man with the intelligence to win a Nobel Prize could seriously believe that Crunchies were less fattening because they are full of air.On Father’s day, a few weeks ago, as we couldn’t be with him, all his grandchildren posted him his favourite chocolate bars. I hear they had a feast in Owen Mor.If dad were here today in the fullness of his health, witnessing the current tensions in the world, he wouldn’t waste the opportunity to say a few words.He’d talk about our common humanity, the need to respect ersity and dference, to protect and deepen democracy, to value education, and to place nonviolence at the absolute centre.He might also stress the right to a living wage and a roof over your head, to decent healthcare and education.If he were here now, he might quote his friend, Congressman John Lewis, who sadly passed away a few weeks ago, appealing to the “goodness of every human being and never giving up”.Dad was a Derryman to his core, and those deep roots of neighbourhood and community served to nourish him through the dficult years.From the beginning, the European Union was like a homecoming to him, bringing together erse cultures in an interdependent relationship, allowing for unique identities while also holding a bigger picture of unied kinship.At this time of planetary fragility, more than ever, he would be urging that we move beyond our flag-based identities, and recognise the need to protect our common home.Central to dad’s work was his deep appreciation of human interdependency. We all need one another, we all have a role to play, and all our roles are of equal importance.In the last years of dad’s le, his physical and mental health became more visibly vulnerable.And yet in those recent years, more than ever, we as a family witnessed the absolute importance of dad’s core ethos, of building community based on respect and love.The kindness shown to him by the people of Derry and Donegal, who stopped to talk to him in the street every day, guided him to protect his independence, and received him with gentlenesshe was agitated, was a profound gt to all of us.We are eternally grateful to all those that helped over the years.In these last two years, when he’d lost his mobility and eyesight, he moved to Owen Mor nursing home.In this, his last home, and it was a home, all of us as a family were made welcome, and became part of a new community of families and carers.The deep attention and love shown to dad and to the many friends he made among carers, residents and their families, will remain a lesson to us for the rest of our lives.During the long weeks of lockdown when we as a family were unable to be with him, we knew that, despite the major dficulties of infection management and bereavement, the Care and Nursing staff in Unit One were doing their absolute best, to care deeply for him, and for all his fellow residents.We know that he continued to sing songs every day, to teach them all a wee bit of French, to tell his jokes, to demand more buns, and to question everyone daily about where they came from, their origins and their families.He remained deeply interested in every inidual, evenhe remembered little of it, until the end of his days.Dad was also a father, a husband and a man who loved and cared for his family at all times.Marrying Pat, our mother, was without a doubt dad’s greatest achievement and she enabled him to reach his full potential.Mum and dad met at a dance in Borderland in Donegal, the starting point for many a Derry family.Romance was followed by a wedding, and a December honeymoon in a freezing BB in Gardiner Street in Dublin.Thankfully for mum, the quality of the accommodation got better as the marriage went on.Our mum, who loved, supported and guided him throughout his tireless work for peace, and later in his frailty, was his greatest blessing.None of us remember him changing nappies, or indeed putting manydinners on the table.What we do remember are endless coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays, newspapers everywhere, and constant stream of callers night and day to our home in West End Park.But he was there for all of us throughout his le. There were times when we felt that he was absent, but he wasn’t, he was just with us from somewhere .Along with mum, he taught us all our values and gave us all our moral compass. And for that we will be forever in their debt.As a family we will remember the man who was rooted in his community, a man who was most comfortable sittng in front of the TV, with half a dozen Crunchie bars to keep him company, and his family around him. Or the odd time holding court around the corner in the Park Bar.A man who ordered the same dinner in the same restaurants in Strasbourg and Greencastle for  years.I’m sure he’s up there now ordering his creme brulee and that awful sweet wine he loved.A man who loved Derry at its best, be that promoting the Candystripes across the world or the many choirs that he brought from here to Europe to sing in Brussels and Strasbourg.A man who didn’t need to be invited twice to lt a mic himself, and give us a blast of the Town I love so well or Matt Hyland, and many, many, many, more besides.A man who truly believed in Derry and the talents of our people, and became our greatest Ambassador to the world.A man who loved Donegal and spent much of his downtime in Bunbeg and Greencastle Moville where he was able to switch off and relax  finally get that peace and quiet he deserved.The care dad received in the last years of his le allowed him to retain his dignity, iniduality and his magnicent strength of character, despite his overwhelming disabilities.It allowed him to overcome.If he were here, he would urge us to look at those young carers and the incredible and heroic daily work they do as a model for future leadership - their ethos of deep respect, a respect for everyone regardless of where they come from or stage of le.These are the foundation stones that are critical to all communities.The Reverend ML King might describe it as the politics of love.Dad would urge us to listen, so that in spite of it all we shall overcome.Thank you dad for a le well lived.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcab-c-ab--acc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandJohn Hume ‘made peace visible during darkest moments’John Hume made peace visible for others even in the darkest moments, his funeral has been told.VideoNorthern IrelandProtect the peace John Hume built, Derry priest urges communityA commitment to peace in Northern Ireland must be John Hume#s lasting legacy, the priest who will celebrate his Requiem Mass on Wednesday has said.GalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumA huge amount of sadness in the Derry air, but also palpable pride for city#s favourite sonThe town that John Hume loved so well, in song and in his heart, showed the feeling was mutual yesterday as people in his native Derry hailed their colossus of change amid calls for the city#s peace bridge to be renamed in his honour.VideoNorthern IrelandJohn Hume gave his le and his health for Ireland, funeral told as peacemaker laid to rest in DerryJohn Hume was a man who gave his le and his health for his country spurred on by compassion and desire to give dignity to everyone, the congregation at the funeral of the Nobel Laureate heard.Most ReadJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral toldA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherJohn Hume gave his le and his health for Ireland, funeral told as peacemaker laid to rest in Derry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral toldA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherJohn Hume gave his le and his health for Ireland, funeral told as peacemaker laid to rest in Derry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood led a delegation of party figures past and present, including veterans Dr Joe Hendron, Alban Maginness, Brid Rodgers and Austin Currie. More contemporary figures were Claire Hanna, Nicola Mallon and Mark H Durkan.Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others Fr Paul FarrenFr Farren said the path towards peace was not easy for Mr Hume. The priest spoke of his compassion, referring to how he comforted families bereaved in the  Greysteel massacre.In a time in our world when often small mindedness and self-focus seems to be the driver, John never put anybody or any specic group first. He put everybody first, he added.He didn#t focus on dference and ision. He focused on unity and peace and giving that dignity to every person.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality.

Mo became tearful as she read her sibling#s tribute to their father.You made us realise a border is just a line on a map. It#s in our hearts and minds where we need to bridge the gap, she said.Thorough over  years of violence, hurt and unrelenting stress, those underlying conditions you never stopped trying to address. I don#t think I ever said aloud how you made us all so incredibly proud. All you ever wanted was to make the world a better place.A statement from the Vatican said: His Holiness Pope Francis was saddened to learn of the death of John Hume, and sends the assurance of his prayers to his family and to all who mourn his loss.A message from the Dalai Lama praised Mr Hume#s deep conviction in the power of dialogue and negotiations.As his remains were taken from St Eugene#s Cathedral, Mr Hume#s long time friend and fellow son of Derry, Phil Coulter, performed a poignant rendition of The Town I Loved So Well on the piano, accompanied on the Irish fiddle by composer, Frank Gallagher.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandDad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherFirst of all I would like to say a word to my brother Aidan who unfortunately cannot be with us today due to Coronavirus restrictions.VideoNorthern Ireland PremiumPandemic robs Derry of farewell befitting global statesman and its favourite son John HumeIn normal times the streets of Derry would have been thronged with heavyweight world leaders, superstars from the entertainment industry and thousands of ordinary people wanting to pay homage to the extraordinary John Hume.

But not the Nash family.Our family always voted for John, even in those early days, says Kate.Mummy would almost come into the booth with you at elections to make sure you voted for John, laughs Linda.Up in Creggan, he was always therea family was having trouble with the army or anything like that.All he seemed to want to do was help people. And it was genuine concern. He wanted a better world for us, said Kate.Hume#s views on equality and dialogue didn#t always sit well with his political opponents and commentators. But Kate says this was not the case locally.Ordinary people always respected John Hume, and they knew he had their best interests at heart. He was an honest man.Other political forces around at the time wouldn#t have appreciated that.He was a powerful man and one of the best to come out of this country. He did so much. He was the peacemaker.A non-violent man. I#m sure there were times he must have been afraid. He went right up to the British soldiers and remonstrated with them. They could have knocked him clean out - or worse. They didn#t care.I was sad to miss it, but I haven#t been well, and I respected what Pat Hume said.I have my candle lighting for him all day.We were lucky to have him. He did so much for this town.And Hume was one of the founding members of the credit union.I joined it about  years ago, and that is how I have lived my le, says Kate.Anything I have needed, that#s where I would have got the money. You could afford to go there and get a loan. It was a leline for lots of people.John Hume was a very special human being. He was non-sectarian, and he never changed. He treated everybody the same.And that#s the way you would like the whole world to be.Gerry Murray was taught history by Hume at St Columb#s College  years ago. They later became friends through the SDLP.Mr Murray went on to study history at Trinity College Dublin and often travelled with Hume to college debates.He was the world#s worst driver. He could sit there for hours, saying nothing, but his mind was churning around.He would suddenly ask a question like, #Who do you think was the best American president #, says Mr Murray. John thought it was Kennedy, he adds.I used to go out campaigning with him in , and he was adored. The people of Derry respected him greatly. There was universality about him. He could talk with anyone.If things weren#t going well for him politically, he could rely on Derry people for support.I was with him one day, and we walked into Da Vinci#s bar, and this boy turned to him and said: #Don#t let the bastards get on top of you John, just keep going#.And as it transpired the man who said that was a republican but he wanted John to succeed. They admired him.That said, some of the people now saying he was a great peacemaker tried to burn his house down. That is what he and his family had to put up with.In a historical context, he was a major figure. Unlike O#Connell and Parnell, he achieved what he set out to achieve.I watched the funeral, and it was very strange not to be there.Seeing Pat and the children, who I would have known growing up, I was half expecting to see John pop into view.He almost seemed to be there without being there. You#d half expect him to turn around and say, #Well, what about ye #It was both heartbreaking and very uplting watching the funeral.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMourners lined the streets as John Hume#s coffin leaves St Eugene#s Cathedral.

Pic Alan Lewis - PhotopressThere is a great regret in the town, especially after the massive send-off that Martin McGuinness got, that we couldn#t do it for John.Yet ironically, he got a greater send-off because it was more from the heart, and it wasn#t a political funeral.It was very poignant seeing all the wee candles lighting in the windows.

As Mr Hume#s remains were carried from St Eugene#s Cathedral following Requiem Mass on Wednesday, Mr Coulter#s musical version of the song could be heard drting from inside.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Coulter said: The Town I Loved So Well was the song he loved so well and we have done a duet on that on many#s an occasion in some weird and wonderful places.It was very poignant for me to play it for John today. It became John#s anthem and certainly any time we were in company and I was asked to play the piano, I could be sure that within seconds Hume would be at my shoulder saying #do the Town#.Mr Coulter acknowledged his friend#s singing capabilities, which he said were like every one  in Derry.He added: John could sing and like everybody in Derry, he believed God gave him the right to sing. A lot of other things, he didn#t give us in Derry but we all believe he made up for that by giving us voices.Mr Coulter said he was saddened that due to the coronavirus control measures, the numbers able to attend his friend#s funeral were restricted.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMusician Phil Coulter  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMusician Phil Coulter He said: It is sad and surely he deserved a State funeral with all the bells and whistles but there is something just more honest about this.This is a Derry funeral and sometimes the pomp and ceremony detracts from the point of it and the real point of it is, for Derry people, to say goodbye to John.For those of us who are here, it is not only to celebrate John#s achievements as a politician which world leaders have been coming forward to speak about, it is also for us to say goodbye to a very special Derry man.It is a Derry occasion and we are immensely proud of John and all he has done for this city, let alone what he has done for the country.This place was always special to John and John was always special to us and we are remembering John Hume, the Derry man.Mr Coulter who has shared a long and abiding friendship with Mr Hume said it was his friend he was remembering.He said: I am remembering the John Hume of many a night#s singsongs over a few pints in Donegal or wherever it might be.There are too many sings-songs in low es and high rises to recall but we had a lot of adventures in ious continents which were all good.

In just a couple of seconds, people lost everything.There are many people who are missing. I#m seeing a lot of pages where they#re putting up pictures, but people are recognising that they#re dead.Lebanese hospitals were already struggling to cope with coronavirus before Tuesday#s massive explosion.Another problem is that many people are starving and can#t take their money out of the banks. That was already happening, Ms Alfahl said.I#m not sure, but from what I#ve seen before, I don#t think the government can support them.They need outside help now. Without it they cannot survive a huge explosion costing millions of dollars.Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer and explosives expert from Northern Ireland, said he believed the blast was a tragic accident with a series of circumstances that have come together to cause a massive explosion. The trouble is that a lot of countries in the Middle East are not well known for applying regulations , he added.The facility in Beirut is unlikely to be a specialist one, which in itself can lead to very dangerous circumstances.The crazy thing is, this was an official facility. The government had seized these goods from a ship. Over time it became a disaster waiting to happen. To say the government is weak and unstable is an understatement. It has real dficulty managing what#s going on in the country and this will probably not have even been on its radar.The international community promised to send Lebanon aid as it struggles to recover.French president Emmanuel Macron is due to visit the country, a former protectorate of France, today. His government has already dispatched two planes full of specialists, rescue workers and supplies to Beirut.The European Union has activated its civil protection system to round up emergency workers and equipment.The EU commission said the plan was to send more than  firefighters with vehicles, snfer dogs and specialist equipment to Lebanon. The Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Poland and the Netherlands have signed up to the relief effort, with other nations expected to follow suit.The EU#s satellite mapping system will also be used to help the local authorities establish the extent of damage. Cyprus, where Tuesday#s blast was felt, is sending in emergency personnel and snfer dogs. Help is also coming from closer to home. Iraq is sending six trucks of medical supplies and an emergency medical team and Egypt and Jordan are supplying field hospitals.Israeli prime minister said his country was ready to help the Lebanese even though the two nations are technically at war.The World Health Organisation is sending medical supplies to cover up to , trauma interventions and up to , surgical interventions following a request from local health chiefs.Belfast Related ContentVideoWorldPeople lost all that they had in seconds: Lebanese QUB student horried by Beirut devastationA pharmacy student in Belfast who grew up in Beirut and a Northern Irish explosives expert have spoken of their shock at the devastating blast in the Lebanese capital.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk e .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bce-bac-aa-bba-fb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKBeirut blast brings reminder of Grenfell suffering as Britons are urged to helpA British-Lebanese fundraiser has said the explosion in Beirut evoked memories of the Grenfell Tower fire as he urged Britons to aid those affected.Most ReadJohn Hume made peace visible for others during darkest moments in Northern Ireland, funeral toldA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyTwo more Co Down businesses close after staff test positive for Covid-Dad made us laugh, dream, think: John Hume Jr#s powerful farewell to fatherJohn Hume gave his le and his health for Ireland, funeral told as peacemaker laid to rest in Derry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades ahead. At a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible .

The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11666150.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
