Since then he has completed the project every other year - including in 2018 - which he said was \u0027crazy\u0027.He said: \u0027After a few months of doing a few drawings a day I realised it was interesting - beyond just being a bet. I was creating moments in drawings that would otherwise get forgotten.\u0027Variety is the spice of life in sensational Sri Lanka: Why...Meet the Mississippi Delta Cowboys: Stunning images...Awed theater audiences, drive-thrus – and his young family...Share this articleMr King, who is a freelance artist, said he was inspired by his home area, adding: \u0027I did quite a lot in Lewisham. For people\u0027s reactions during the World Cup I was usually in a pub in the area.\u0027Everybody was becoming more and more excited and surprised by the football and everyone was out because it was so hot. When England scored, the sketch will look quite rushed and there\u0027s arms going everywhere.

I like to draw on things other than paper. It adds another lawyer to the drawing. \u0027With the coffee cup drawing - everyone has held a coffee cup and it adds to what that\u0027s about. I\u0027ve also got drawings on beer mats and Lemsip packets.\u0027          A Brexit-related sketche by Mr King was from inside Brockley\u0027s Rock fish and chip shop in South London on September 24          An April 13 sketch is of his mother and father sitting at home, with a speech bubble saying: \u0027Google, play some relaxing music\u0027          A sketch dated to October 14 hints at problems for commuters on the Southern Rail network amid wet and dreary skiesMr King\u0027s favourite sketch is of when protesters marched against Donald Trump\u0027s visit. He said: \u0027That was fun to capture because there was so much going on. I was working in Soho and when I left at 4pm the streets were just packed. \u0027I had never seen anything like it. I went into the middle of the crowd and started drawing. I walked to Trafalgar Square with all these people in costume singing and chanting. \u0027It was also interesting because people weren\u0027t just holding placards made from cardboard. They were holding up iPads and phones that read \u0027F*** Trump\u0027.\u0027But Mr King said it was not just the big events of the year that are worth memorialising in pencil. One sketch is of his mother and father sitting at home. A speech bubble next to his mum said: \u0027Google, play some relaxing music.\u0027          Mr King captured the summer heatwave that gripped Britain on July 9, with people pictured sweating and fanning themselves          A branch of the Morley\u0027s fried chicken chain in Lewisham, South East London, is sketched at sunset by Mr King on April 12          A child looks at an ipHone in a pram while a mother feeds them McDonald\u0027s chips in this sketch from December 22He said: \u0027That is my mum and dad in Bristol.

I got them a Google Home at Christmas, now they use it all the time.\u0027She just said to it one day to play some relaxing music, I thought that was funny. I did a lot of regular stuff like on buses and trains.\u0027Newspapers, history books and cameras don\u0027t always remember the sorts of things I have captured - changes in fashion, and technology for example. Just subtle ways of remembering that period.\u0027These are things you wouldn\u0027t think is worth a photo.

He then wept throughout their conversation and angrily denied making up that he had been attacked Empire creators cut Jussie Smollett\u0027s character from the...\u0027If you\u0027re gonna break the law, do not write a check\u0027:...Share this articleOthers told DailyMail.com that they shared the opposite sentiment. \u0027The fact that this interview was an integral part of the police investigation proves she wasn’t taken advantage of – quite the opposite.           On Thursday morning, Roberts said the developments in the case were a \u0027setback for race relations, homophobia, MAGA supporters – the fingers were pointed at them.\u0027\u0027She did her job as a journalist and conducted an incredibly newsworthy interview,\u0027 one production source said.Within a few hours of Smollett\u0027s interview being aired, Chicago Police Department announced it had identified the two men in the surveillance video that had been circulated for weeks beforehand. The two men are Abel and Ola Osundairo who were picked up by officers as they returned to Chicago on February 13 from Nigeria.Police were questioning them when Smollet\u0027s GMA interview was aired. It was not until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold on the pair that police say their investigation shifted and put Smollett in the frame.  On Monday, an interview Roberts had landed with the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who tore through Smollett will air. Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson reserved no mercy for Smollett as he announced the police\u0027s case against him on Thursday morning. During an extraordinary press conference, he made reference to Smollett\u0027s tearful GMA appearance and condemned it, saying he could not watch the whole thing because it \u0027angered\u0027 him.           Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly \u0027To be quite honest, it\u0027s shameful. It painted this city that we all love and work hard in in a negative connotation.\u0027To insinuate an to stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew as a celebrity it would get a lot of attention, it\u0027s just despicable.   Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on Thursday morning\u0027It makes you wonder what goes through someone\u0027s mind so yes, I did see part of the interview and I was angered by it,\u0027 he said. He also said that Smollett helped their investigation into him along by confirming to Roberts that the two men in the video - who they knew were Abel and Ola Osundairo - were the attackers.\u0027He identified who those two iniduals were. We knew that then but he didn\u0027t know that we knew.\u0027But yeah he helped us out when he identified them,\u0027 he said. During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth. \u0027You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,\u0027 he said.   Elsewhere he described himself \u0027fighting the f*** back\u0027 when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: \u0027The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.\u0027 He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.    Roberts will interview Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson on Monday. He eviscerated the actor on Thursday morning and mentioned the ABC interview in his remarks, describing it as \u0027shameful\u0027 that Smollett would go on television to allegedly lie \u0027Subway is open for 24 hours. People kill me when they say stuff like that because Subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you\u0027re hungry at night and you ain\u0027t got no food, you go to Subway!\u0027 he said.He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place. Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: \u0027There is a level of pride there.\u0027We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.\u0027  Smollett was bailed out of Cook County Jail on Thursday afternoon after posting $10,000 in bond money, ten percent of the total $100,000 that was set by a judge. His attorneys insist he is innocent and say he has been treated unfairly by the police and the prosecutor\u0027s office."},{"url":null,"title":"The true cost Meghans baby shower","story":"    At a tricky crossroads: Meghan in New York with Suits actress Abigail SpencerThe Duchess of Sussex was in New York this week, catching up with friends, having lunch and doing a little light shopping. It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.    Taking a tough line: Patrick Jephson with Princess Diana. Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96  Get Meghan\u0026#39s laid back look in an Ingrid \u0026amp Isabel jacketClick here to buyThe royal baby shower is officially over, and as the Duchess of Sussex travels back to Kensington Palace, she’s doing it in style.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

No, of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.’‘So, there are limits then?’‘To committing murder, yes! But there’s nothing empowering about murder.’‘Those doing it might disagree, but you get my point. There are always limits, to everything. And now we’ve established there are limits to feminism, what did you think about Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajowski when they posted topless selfies of themselves flipping the bird? How is that remotely empowering?’‘It’s empowering because they are both free to do whatever they want with their bodies, and if they want to express themselves in that way, that is their choice and their right.’‘Sure, but isn’t it also my choice and right to criticise them for it?’‘Why should you?’          So now here she was, my pint-sized nemesis – standing just 5ft 3in tall, wearing a large sweatshirt and very small shorts, and with her striking brown eyes blazing defiantly at me.

It’s their life, their body. There’s such a double standard – male stars like Justin Bieber go topless all the time but nobody attacks him for it. I’m sure Kim and Emily did that picture because they were sick and tired of people criticising them all the time.’‘No,’ I interrupted, ‘they did it for commercial gain. Their careers are literally built on taking their clothes off and they’ve made millions doing it. They don’t have a world class talent like you.’I mentioned how I mock-tweeted about Kim Kardashian two nights ago when she appeared at a Hollywood beauty awards show in a tacky, cleavage-bulging bondage style black cut-out Thierry Mugler dress.Ariana thought for a few seconds.‘Let me say this: when you criticise women for what they wear like that, you don’t know what else they’ve been trying on to get to that point. You don’t know all the stress, and all the outfits, they’ve gone through trying to decide what will work and won’t work. It can be so nerve-wracking. You also don’t know how much they’ve been body shamed and what effect that has on any woman. It can make you feel horrible.’These were good points, but she needed a better example to illustrate them than the world’s most shameless clotheshorse.‘Kim Kardashian wears this outrageous stuff specifically so we all talk about it,’ I protested, ‘it’s literally her brand.’‘OK, but you were so wrong about Little Mix. I toured with those girls and I understood exactly what they were doing and saying. They were standing up for all girls who’ve been called those horrible names, and saying it doesn’t matter what people call you, you should feel proud of yourself and your body, and strong. I felt that when I saw their photo.’‘You did?’‘Yes. I used to be called all those horrible names myself, long before I was famous or even an adult. So with respect, I can relate to what young girls go through far better than you.’‘I accept that. But I have a 7-year-old daughter, I don’t want her thinking nudity is the route to success. That is my concern.’‘I understand that, I do,’ she said, but you should want your daughter to grow up believing she is free to do what she wants with her body and with her life.’‘I do, but whilst I believe you when you say YOU don’t use nudity or sex as a cynical commercial tool, and that for you it is a form of art attached to your performing, there are some other female stars who I am damn sure do.’‘I agree,’ she replied. ‘See, I AGREE. We’ve reached common ground again. Let’s get another drink to celebrate.’          Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together. But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did itAriana turned to a waiter standing nearby.‘Can you get me and my new best friend Piers a glass of wine please?’ she asked him. ‘I’m paying.’Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together.But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did it.‘NO! NO! NO!’ she screamed. ‘Always look me in the eye as you clink. Do it again!’We clinked again, and this time I looked into her eyes.‘That’s better. OK, now we can drink.’‘Fiery little thing, aren’t you?’ I laughed.‘I’m Italian, half Sicilian, half Abruzzese. So I make no apologies for being passionate – it’s in my blood!’Victoria suddenly announced that she wanted to perform a trick with a toothpick and napkin, so we all stopped talking to watch.It was a simple, but well executed trick, and we applauded.‘This is fun,’ said Ariana. ‘I’m glad we bumped into each other.’‘Me too,’ I said, and I meant it. She’s a bright, lively, warm and entertaining young woman.But our F-word debate was far from over.‘I think radical feminism does immense damage to feminists,’ I suggested.‘What do you mean by radical feminism?’ she asked.I took out my phone and showed her a photo I had tweeted earlier in the day of a desecrated statue in Florida.Last Sunday, a former US sailor named George Mendonsa died.He was immortalised by Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous World War II photo on V-J Day in Times Square, which caught euphoric George sweeping dental nurse Greta Friedman – a stranger to him – into his arms and kissing her.They later became friends, and Greta said she had no issue with what George had done, understanding that he was showing spontaneous appreciation for all the work nurses did in the war.But on Monday, the day after George Mendonsa died, the statue depicting the moment was defaced with the words #MeToo in red paint.‘This is where radical feminism damages feminists,’ I said.‘I agree that doesn’t seem right,’ Ariana nodded. ‘There has to be some common sense and balance.’          Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up. Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version‘If women hate men, then everyone loses,’ I said.‘Yes, I agree. But women don’t hate men.’‘Some radical feminists definitely hate men.’‘OK, some may do. But most women don’t.’‘No, and most men want to treat women properly, fairly and equally.’‘OK, I accept that too.’We smiled.‘See, we’re really getting somewhere!’ she cried. ‘This is good. We’re finding common ground.’‘You know what else really p****d me off?’ I continued. ‘When “Baby It’s Cold Outside” was banned by some American radio stations for supposedly representing sexual assault. That’s bullsh*t.’Ariana’s eyes promptly welled up with tears.‘You OK?’ I asked.‘Yes, I’m sorry. That song is special to me.’Then she took my phone and hurriedly Googled something.‘There… Mac and I recorded a duet of it together. Not many people know about it. I love that song.’Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up.Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version.I suddenly felt incredibly sad for her.For a young woman, Ariana Grande’s had to endure some awful things in her life.‘You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?’ I said.‘Yes. I don’t want to make out I’m been through any worse than anyone else. Everyone has their problems and their sh*t to deal with. But in recent years, I have…had a lot of pain and sadness.’The Manchester terror attack was an unimaginably dreadful and emotionally scarring experience.‘You know, I really admired your guts when you went back and put on that concert,’ I said. ‘I remember seeing you on stage, alone and tiny, and thinking how frightened you must have felt looking out at a huge stadium full of people and not knowing for sure there wasn’t some other lunatic out there waiting to do something terrible again.’‘I…..I……’ Ariana tried to speak, but tears flowed again. ‘I was scared, yes. But I had to do it.’‘I’ll be honest, I thought you were wrong to fly home after the attack.’‘I didn’t want to,’ she said, ‘I was told to, and it was all so chaotic and upsetting I just did what I was told. I wasn’t thinking straight.’‘I wrote a column attacking you for it.’‘You did? I never saw that.’‘Then you probably didn’t see my second column apologising to you when you flew back?’‘No!’I pulled out my phone again, found the column and urged her to read it.‘I don’t know if I want to, it all brings back such terrible memories for me.’But she did read it, slowly and carefully.The column ended with these words:‘Ariana, we’ve never met and I doubt I’ll be on your dinner party schedule any time soon. But I want you to know this: I seriously misjudged you. I had you down as just another self-obsessed millionaire pop star prepared to put her own safety before that of her fans. I was completely wrong. In fact, you’re an exceptional young woman who last night put on an exceptional show and in doing so, sent a massive two fingers to the disgusting creeps who thought they could bomb you and your fans into submission. That took huge personal courage, yes. But more than that, it took spirit. An indomitable spirit.The Blitz spirit. The kind that says: ‘I don’t care who you are, or how badly you want to hurt me or my way of life, or that of those I love, I’m not having it.’ My army brother says there are two types of people in life: those you’d want in the trenches next to you, and those you wouldn’t. Ms Grande, I’d have you in the trenches next to me any time. I’m sorry I questioned your courage. You’re one helluva gutsy young lady.’As Ariana finished reading this, she wept again.‘That was so kind, thank you.’‘I meant it,’ I replied. ‘I very rarely apologise to anyone for anything but I misjudged you, and I wanted to say so.’‘Well, I appreciate that. It seems I misjudged you, too.’John handed her a tissue.‘I’m so sorry for crying so much!’ she laughed. ‘I’m a very emotional person and these things really affect me.’‘It would be very strange if they didn’t,’ I said.‘Come meet my friends,’ Ariana commanded, so John and I walked over with her to her table and met her group.‘Good news!’ I announced, ‘Ariana’s decided to make her next record about me, it’s going to be called Thank u Piersy.’They looked at each other uneasily, then realised I was joking and laughed, with palpable relief.More wine arrived, and Ariana reprimanded me again for incorrect clinking technique. ‘LOOK INTO MY EYES!’‘Apologies.’I looked into her eyes and then proposed a toast to her and her team for their chart-busting triumph.‘You should all be very proud,’ I said, ‘this is an amazing achievement.’‘I couldn’t do any of this without these wonderful people,’ Ariana responded. ‘I have worked so hard to get to this point, so many shows, so many flights, so many hotels, so many media appearances, I’ve done whatever has needed to be done. I have no other life at the moment. But when you get a week like, you realise what you’ve been working for.’‘Has it been worth all the sacrifice?’‘Yes. It’s what I wanted. I love music. It’s my life. Music and my friends like these guys.’Then she turned to them: ‘I’ve been educating Piers about feminism.’They laughed, and I laughed.‘The most important thing you said tonight is that feminists have to bring men with them in their battle,’ I said. ‘Annie Lennox said the same thing to me, and I think it’s vital.’‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘but you men have to bring women with you too. It’s a two-way street. Remember Piers, this is about EQUALITY, in EVERYTHING… including PAY! We should be paid the same as men!’‘I totally agree,’ I said. ‘And men should be paid the same as women, right?’‘Right.’‘OK, so I’d like to be paid the exact same amount as you. What are you earning these days - $20 million a week?’There was a moment of silence before everyone exploded with laughter.‘You can’t sing!’ she insisted.‘I can sing!’ I retorted. ‘In fact, I regularly sing on TV to millions of people. So I demand equal pay as you.’‘That’s not how this works...’ she chuckled.‘Complicated, isn’t it?’ I countered.‘It doesn’t have to be.’Around 11.45pm, two hours of chat later, I stood up to leave.Ariana sprang up too, ran round the table and exclaimed: ‘Can we hug? Would that be inappropriate?’‘Yes, of course,’ I replied.So we hugged.‘I’m so glad we met,’ she said.‘Me too,’ I replied.‘I think we’re going to be good friends,’ she said, ‘we’re a lot more alike than I realised.’Ariana Grande is an extraordinarily charismatic and talented young lady, right at the top of her professional game.I enjoyed her company enormously, and appreciated her desire – particularly in these highly partisan BrexitTrump times - to engage so enthusiastically in respectful debate with someone she had previously locked horns with on Twitter.John and I left, and as we walked back into the chilly Beverly Hills night air, we both burst out laughing.‘Did that just happen?’ he asked.‘It did,’ I said. ‘Only in Hollywood, right?’Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Casablanca AirportTheresa May delays meaningful vote on final Brexit deal until March 12Michael Gove admits food prices could rise in no deal BrexitShamima Begum pleads for Government to \u0027re-evaluate\u0027 her caseStripper performs erotic dance to entertain Russian policemenMore evacuation trucks leave last ISIS held area in SyriaChuka Umunna on Labour bullying: \u0027Somebody was arrested for threats\u0027Amber Peat\u0027s parents make an appeal before she was confirmed deadMet Office announces temperatures will reach 18C on SundayAaron Campbell caught on mum\u0027s CCTV an hour after killing AleshaSmall boat floats off Dover coast as Border Force vessel is launchedPolice say Smollett staged ‘hate crime’ to advance career"},{"url":null,"title":"Jewish Labour MP defect Corbyns party","story":"    Dame Louise Ellman was barracked by supporters of the Labour leader during a bruising meeting of her Liverpool Riverside constituency party A Jewish Labour MP who was subjected to a ‘Soviet show trial’ by party members was last night at the centre of claims that she will be the next MP to defect from Jeremy Corbyn’s party.Just hours after Mr Corbyn claimed that there was no ‘widespread’ problem of anti-Semitism in the Party, Dame Louise Ellman was barracked by supporters of the Labour leader during a bruising meeting of her Liverpool Riverside constituency party on Friday evening. The hard-Left activists overwhelmingly passed a motion supporting the activists who targeted fellow Liverpool MP Luciana Berger, leading a friend of Dame Louise to say: ‘Louise will not be in the party for much longer.’Ms Berger, who is also Jewish and required a bodyguard at last year’s Labour Party Conference after receiving death threats, quit Labour on Monday saying the party was ‘institutionally anti-Semitic’ – a day after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was on the brink of forming a breakaway movement in protest at Mr Corbyn’s failure to tackle the problem. She was one of the seven Labour MP founders of The Independent Group.  This newspaper reported last year that Mr Corbyn and others on his staff had been heard describing Dame Louise as ‘the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv’, a claim which the Corbyn camp denied.Queen to enjoy a rare \u0027secret\u0027 dinner with the US Ambassador...\u0027Walking away from our movement achieves nothing\u0027: Jeremy...Share this articleDuring raucous scenes in Friday’s meeting a motion was passed expressing ‘complete solidarity’ with the executive of Ms Berger’s Wavertree party and depicting the allegations that she was forced out of the party by bullying local activists as a ‘smear’.Former Liverpool Mayor Malcolm Kennedy said he believed Dame Louise was being subjected to a ‘bullying’ campaign. ‘It’s the atmosphere, it’s the attitudes,’ he said.          A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth (pictured above) did not have ‘human blood’Dame Louise has been repeatedly attacked by Left-wing activists since speaking out on the anti-Semitism scandal, who have seized on her support for the Labour Friends of Israel group, of which she is vice-chairwoman.Her friends said that she was ‘agonising’ over her future in the party which she joined over 55 years ago. One said: ‘She doesn’t like the idea of joining other groups but she is re-ally struggling with how the party’s handled the anti-Semitism row.’          Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’Speaking in Tory defector Anna Soubry’s Broxtowe seat – a key Labour target at the next Election – he accused the ‘mainstream media’ of being ‘unkeen on relating to day-to-day issues that people faced in their lives’. He said that in a Sky News interview on Friday he had had to intervene to ask: ‘Is there any chance that anybody other than an MP could be referred to in any of your questions and we could actually talk about the homeless, the poverty, the hospital waiting lists?’In the interview, Mr Corbyn claimed the media ‘only ever talk about Westminster gossip’.But last night, Dudley North MP Ian Austin, one of the nine Labour MPs who walked out of the party last week, accused Mr Corbyn of failing to appreciate the scale of the crisis.He said: ‘Labour will never be in a position to do anything about homelessness and poverty unless it faces up to the nature of his leadership and this really unpleasant culture of intolerance and extremism. Jeremy Corbyn still doesn’t get it.’                        A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth did not have ‘human blood’ – five months after the party’s deputy leader Tom Watson filed a complaint.Mr Corbyn was challenged last week to explain why the party had apparently not suspended Arjum Wajid for ‘outrageous’ attacks on them last summer.Ms Wajid tweeted: ‘Don’t know what runs through their veins, not human blood. Their hearts and brains totally devoid of humanity and eyes blind to truth.’Separately at a private meeting in Westminster last week, Mrs Smeeth told Mr Corbyn: ‘I think you would be happy if I left the party.’When he apparently failed to reply, sources say party general secretary Jennie Formby interjected to tell the MP: ‘I want you to stay.’Mrs Smeeth then issued a vow to remain in the party, saying: ‘I am staying. If I am the last Jew in the Labour Party, I’m staying. I’m not going.’In 2016, Mrs Smeeth left Mr Corbyn’s launch of an anti-Semitism report in tears after being taunted by a Corbynista.Ms Berger’s departure has put pressure on other Jewish MPs in the party – including Dame Louise, Mrs Smeeth, Dame Margaret Hodge and Alex Sobel – to follow suit.Ian Austin, an adopted son of a Jewish refugee, announced he was leaving the party on Friday, but said he would not be joining The Independent Group. Former leader Ed Miliband, who is Jewish, has said he has no intention of quitting the party.Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’ Last night, when asked about the decision of her local party to express solidarity with the Wavertree Constituency Labour Party executive, Dame Louise said: ‘This is shameful.’ She refused to confirm that she would quit the party.Party sources said they could not comment on inidual cases but insisted Ms Wajid was still being taken through party disciplinary procedures. A spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.‘All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"One five workers call sick face office nemesis","story":"Fun in the sun!

The source said: ‘It was absolutely chilling. At first, the managers tried to suggest someone had just left a knife carelessly, but it was balanced on its edge with the blade uppermost.’There is no suggestion that Mr Aram was involved in that incident as he was not in the office that day.          Several women at Henderson Rowe had complained about sexist comments from Mr Aram (pictured) In a separate incident last year, an Arab employee with a Jewish wife had offensive messages written in a birthday card, including a picture of the IS flag, a drawing of a man having sex with a camel and a sketch of the star of David on a penis. Mr Rowe signed the card with an insult.Mr Aram’s use of the n-word came in a conversation with a group of junior male colleagues following a ‘cultural realignment session’ organised by RGA last year. When a colleague questioned the use of the term ‘girls’ for young women, Mr Aram mockingly equated it with the n-word.He said: ‘Well that’s like coloured gentlemen calling each other n*****s. Girls are allowed to call themselves girls but you can’t.’The Mail on Sunday has spoken to several people who witnessed Mr Rowe’s naked rendition in the basement of a Mayfair restaurant hired for the Christmas party in 2016.It is believed Mr Rowe, 63, a former employee of the ‘Queen’s stockbrokers’ Cazenove, had lost a bet. He is still with the company but gave up the CEO role last year.A source said: ‘About half the people there were young women.

Henderson Rowe denied this, saying last year a ‘third-party investigation’ was launched into the firm’s trading practices going back six years and ‘no evidence of systematic churning’ was found.Mike Bowers, RGA’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We acknowledge Henderson Rowe has in the past tolerated language and jokes that are inconsistent with Rayliant’s values.

It’s not just concerning – it’s appalling, especially over the issue of anti-Semitism.’Our investigation also shows that Milne has parroted Kremlin propaganda, defending Russian aggression against its neighbours, from its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing campaign against Ukraine. Our findings prompted the former head of MI6 to warn last night that if Corbyn were to win a General Election, he would have to cut off contact with Milne because of the risk Milne poses to national security.Sir Richard Dearlove, who led the Secret Intelligence Service between 1999 and 2004, said Milne stood ‘no chance’ of passing Whitehall’s system of background checks, known as developed vetting, and so could not be allowed to see classified documents.The Mail on Sunday can reveal:During a university vacation in 1977, Milne visited Lebanon during its civil war, and met Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) terrorists dedicated to destroying Israel by violence Returning to England, he set up and ran a campaign to spread PLO propaganda at Oxford UniversityLater, Milne forged links with Hamas, which remains committed to Israel’s destruction and has perpetrated hundreds of terrorist attacks – and travelled with Corbyn to meet its leaders on a trip to the Middle East funded by UK Hamas sympathisers in 2010After graduating in 1979, he became the business manager for a hardline, pro-Soviet newspaper that backed PLO violence, Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in Iran, the taking of American hostages and the Russian invasion of AfghanistanThe paper’s star columnist was a long-standing Kremlin moleMilne personally backed the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the trigger for decades of terrorist violence, arguing that it was a ‘progressive’ event that was ‘liberating’ Afghan women and improving human rightsAs a reporter for The Guardian newspaper in the 1980s, Milne acquired a powerful mentor – features editor Richard Gott, who was later forced to resign after admitting that he took a series of foreign trips paid for by the Soviets, during which he met KGB officialsAfter the 1984 Provisional IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference – which killed five people and injured 31 – Milne told Guardian colleagues ‘I think it is a very daring attack’, as maimed victims were still being carried from the wreckageIn 2014 he chaired a conference session in Russia at which the star speaker was Vladimir Putin, with all his expenses paid for by its organisers, a think-tank close to Putin’s government. Afterwards, he was criticised by his colleagues at The Guardian, which had boycotted the event because it took place just months after Russia illegally seized Crimea from Ukraine.Last summer, when the depth of Labour’s anti-Semitism crisis first became apparent, Jeremy Corbyn tried to stop Labour adopting the full and unmodified International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.The IHRA says it is anti-Semitic to claim the State of Israel is an inherently ‘racist endeavour’ which has no right to exist. Milne has supported groups that make this anti-Semitic claim and advocate violence to achieve their goals since he was a teenager. Moderate Labour MPs say Milne’s beliefs have an ‘undue influence’ on Labour policy and its mishandling of the anti-Semitism crisis that has engulfed the party.          Last summer, when the depth of Labour’s anti-Semitism crisis first became apparent, Jeremy Corbyn tried to stop Labour adopting the full and unmodified International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-SemitismThey claim the 60-year-old wields power over the party leader which is unprecedented for someone in his position as spin doctor.‘Again and again, MPs have asked to see Corbyn to talk about anti-Semitism, and when they got to his room, they found themselves talking to Milne,’ one MP said.The MP added: ‘The only reason I am reluctant to put my name to this is that I know that, if I do, I will get death threats. But he has absolute, complete influence over Corbyn. I don’t think Jeremy makes a decision about anything without Seumas Milne signing off on it.’A senior party staff member said: ‘Without a shadow of a doubt, Corbyn trusts Milne more than anyone. I actually think Corbyn is a little bit thick. It’s no exaggeration to say that Milne is Corbyn’s brain.’He added that this was why Corbyn resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism until he was finally overruled by his National Executive: ‘Seumas has been supporting groups that deny Israel’s right to exist for many years.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans caterer gushes Marie Antoinette approved Duchesss baby shower banquet","story":"    The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queenExquisitely hand-crafted from an original French recipe dating back to 1862, they were the crowning feature on a table of sweet treats fit for a queen – or at the very least a heavily-pregnant duchess.Four French macaron ‘towers’ from the famous Parisian bakery Ladurée last week became the highlight of the spectacular baby shower feast enjoyed by Meghan Markle and her A-list friends in New York.While the five-day, £350,000 extravaganza – culminating in a party inside America’s most expensive hotel suite at The Mark in Manhattan – made headlines around the world, The Mail on Sunday can today reveal just how opulent Wednesday’s celebratory banquet really was.It was so lavish, in fact, that Ladurée’s website boasts of how its signature macaron towers ‘evoke the Parisian glamour and elegance that Marie Antoinette would approve of’.The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queen who, when told that her subjects were starving and had no bread, replied: ‘Let them eat cake.’But the scale and grandeur of the table which greeted famously sweet-toothed Meghan and up to 20 guests was staggering. Central were the four macaron towers, costing a total of £350 and infused with the delicate flavours of rose petals, passion fruit, vanilla and pistachio.Made from organic almond flour, eggs and sugar, each delicate macaron is handmade using two outer shells with a piped ganache filling. Thousands of yellow vest protesters take to the streets...The look that hooked Meghan’s dad: The charming high school...Share this articleThey contain an average of 80 calories each and are gluten-free – and should not be confused with a a traditional British macaroon made with coconut and almonds.The four custom-made pyramid cakes – two medium-sized and two small – were from Ladurée’s store on New York’s exclusive Madison Avenue, an order which requires two-days’ notice.

The picture showed a gold-rimmed plate with a pale green baby rattle pop cake, a cupcake with a stencilled pram decoration and a biscuit in the shape of a stork carrying a baby.But The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Meghan, radiant in a white-spotted navy blue maternity dress, had far more than designer biscuits to choose from.The groaning table, covered in a thick cream linen tablecloth, was anchored by a spectacular centrepiece of a huge glass vase containing 3ft high cherry blossom branches. Scattered arrangements of Meghan’s favourite pink peonies and delicate sweet peas completed the elegant look.In addition to the macaron towers, there was more drama in the cakes and confectionery thought to have been made by Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose eponymous restaurant at The Mark is considered one of the finest in New York. Meghan, 37, who is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant, is a self-confessed foodie and while guests including her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, Ms Mulroney, hairdresser Serge Normant and designer Misha Nonoo were serenaded by harpist Erin Hill, the food was the real star. Custom-made cakes including Key lime tarts, cherry tarts, red velvet cakes and carrot cakes, sat beside gold-embellished containers filled with sugar crystals into which stork-shaped biscuits had been artfully arranged.Health-conscious Meghan insisted on items being marked ‘gluten free’ for those with dietary constraints.There were also cotton candy pom poms (candy floss on sticks) – explaining the delivery of a candy floss machine to the hotel during a snow storm on the eve of the party – and a jar of multi-coloured ‘donut holes’ that were gluten-free and just 40 calories each. Sources said Ms Williams’ designer biscuits, including iced storks on lollipop sticks, trays of sweet bunnies with chocolate piping and biscuits in the shape of traditional English prams in blue icing, were a hit.The colour scheme featured multiple hues of blues, pinks, yellows and greens and gave no hint as to the gender of the future Baby Sussex. ‘It was a delicious palate of colours and a very sophisticated table,’ a source said.‘There was no dominant colour theme. It was just opulent, luxurious and completely over the top.’ Cupcakes topped with yellow and orange piped flowers (130 calories each) sat beside mini lemon meringue pies (325 calories) and pink meringues (100 calories).    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are welcomed by officials on their arrival at Casablanca airport, for their tour of MoroccoThe four macaron towers sat on white royal icing bases and the banquet featured a spectacular white ‘pop cake’ pyramid decorated with hand-crafted pink paper flowers that, according to one observer, ‘looked almost too good to eat’.Drinks ranged from vintage champagne to designer teas and £12 bottles of water.The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom trees.     The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom treesWhile the cost of the five-day celebration, including Meghan’s one-bedroom, £15,312-a-night suite and her ride in George Clooney’s private jet was estimated at £350,000, the food alone may have cost up to £20,000.  Meghan, 37, is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant One Los Angeles-based private chef who works for A-list celebrities said: ‘If you look at the ingredients alone, then you’d probably be looking at two to three grand, but when you factor in The Mark hotel and Jean-Georges, then the sky is the limit. If I was to put a figure on an event like this, in a location like that, I’d say ten to 20 grand.’There have been suggestions that the New York bash was used by Meghan to wrest back control of her own image. It certainly drew huge media attention with scores of photographers camped behind barriers outside the hotel.The duchess arrived in New York on February 15. The following day she had dinner with Ms Williams, Ms Mulroney and close friend Markus Anderson.Guests arrived at the baby shower with gifts including a £326 Babyletto crib and a £470 Trek bicycle. Flowers were provided by a company called Lady Fleur and Meghan later donated the arrangements to charities. However, the fate of any left-over food is unknown. The LA chef said: ‘It’s doubtful that number of guests could possibly have consumed that amount of food.‘It would be nice to think that someone somewhere might be enjoying a rose-petal flavoured French macaron.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Shamima Begums father says governments side","story":"    Ahmed Ali, the father of Shamima Begum, outside his house in the Sunamganj area of  Bangladesh. Mr Ali has said he backs Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to strip his daughter of her British citizenshipHe last saw his youngest daughter on a visit to the UK two months before she fled to Syria with schoolfriends Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in March 2015.Mr Ali said he had been shocked by her lack of remorse about joining IS during a series of media interviews at a Syrian refugee camp last week.Begum, who gave birth to a son, Jarrah, last Sunday, pleaded to be allowed back to the UK but caused outrage by failing to apologise for joining the terror group and arguing that the 2017 bombing of the Manchester Arena by an Islamic extremist was justified.‘If she at least admitted she made a mistake then I would feel sorry for her and other people would feel sorry for her. But she does not accept her wrong,’ Mr Ali said.He insisted she had shown no sign of being radicalised.‘I never saw anything of concern in her at the time,’ he added. ‘She was as usual, normal. She never used to pray regularly, she was not that Islamic-minded.’\u0027British women are hiding among us\u0027: ISIS women in refugee...Pregnant at just 10, girl is trapped as sex slave in ISIS...Share this articleMr Javid sparked controversy last week by stripping Begum, 19, of her British nationality on the grounds that she is eligible for citizenship of Bangladesh through her mother.Begum’s relatives in Britain have warned the Home Secretary that they will challenge his decision in the courts and The Mail on Sunday has unearthed a case with striking similarities that may provide them with hope.    Shabina Aslam, 29, and Alireza Sabar, 17, from Didsbury, Manchester, say they miss their independenceThe case involved another jihadi bride, identified only as ‘G3’, who fled to Syria to join IS with her two children, then aged one and two, in November 2016. She was arrested in Turkey as she tried to return to the UK.As with Begum, the Home Office stripped the woman – of Bangladeshi heritage but born in Enfield, North London – of her British citizenship. However, her family won an appeal.Last night an official for Kurdish forces holding the jihadi prisoners at Al-Hole insisted Begum should be repatriated, saying: ‘It is not just Britain but all the countries – we want them to take their prisoners.’  So Mr Javid, what will you do with all of these women once they decide to return?   These are some of the 150 British women who joined Islamic State in Syria and are thought to still be in the region   Shamima Begum is one of more than 150 British women and girls who fled to Syria to join the barbaric Islamic State terror group.The Mail on Sunday has identified 26 women who are still at large, and a further four who have returned home. Jihadi brides are more likely to come back to the UK than their husbands, many of whom died fighting.As IS loses its last stronghold in Baghouz, there have been reports of an exodus of British jihadi brides and their children to Kurdish refugee camps in the north of Syria.The Kurdish authorities have said as many as 12 British jihadi brides are living in Al-Hol, the camp where Begum was found.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has stripped Begum of her British citizenship. Attempts to do the same to other jihadi brides is likely to result in dozens of battles in the High Court over the next few years. "},{"url":null,"title":"ALEXANDRA SHULMANS NOTEBOOK spat fashion god Karl Lagerfeld written longhand","story":"    My own relationship with the long-time creative director of Fendi and Chanel was entirely professional.

It was about how professional, private-school-educated people were terrified of being considered posh. And how het up we all were about the idea of an Old Etonian (David Cameron) becoming the next Prime Minister.I suggested that wearing a Chanel jacket would be as helpful to a successful political career in this country as a touch of leprosy, and a private education was an embarrassing inconvenience, not something to be flaunted.

And then, obviously, we\u0027ll be having the debate the next day.\u0027The PM said the Government was still in talks with the EU about the Northern Ireland backstop.   Cabinet ministers Business Secretary Greg Clark, Works and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Justice Secretary David Gauke have argued for an extension to Article 50Mrs May said: \u0027We are still in that negotiation. We are still talking to the EU about various ways in which we can find a resolution to the issue that Parliament raised.\u0027Asked what she would do if she lost the meaningful vote, she told The Guardian: \u0027Why is it that people are always trying to look for the next thing after the next thing after the next thing?\u0027It is pointless, we should focus on what we are doing now, which is working to get a deal, and bring that deal to a meaningful vote – which I want to see passed by the House of Commons and leave on 29 March.\u0027 The PM insisted collective Cabinet responsibility had not broken down after the intervention by Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke.\u0027No,\u0027 she said, \u0027collective responsibility has not broken down.\u0027What we have seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That is not a surprise to anybody.          Mrs May said today there were \u0027strong views\u0027 on Europe around the Cabinet table \u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for and that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027Asked if the three ministers should remain in Government, Mrs May said: \u0027What we see around the Cabinet table is strong views held on the issue of Europe.\u0027Mrs May said that extending Article 50 would not deal with the issues.The PM said: \u0027Now, often people talk about the extension of Article 50 as if that will actually solve the issue. Of course it won\u0027t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.\u0027Extension of Article 50 doesn\u0027t solve the problem.\u0027There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that\u0027s been negotiated or not.\u0027And that will be a decision for every member of Parliament across the House.\u0027Every member of the Commons will have to face that decision when that point comes.\u0027The Government will be bringing back, working with the EU, and will want to put a deal to the House of Commons in a meaningful vote.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Scientists create super smart rat CYBORGS steered maze human thought","story":"    Scientists in China have developed super smart rat cyborgs that can be controlled around a maze by human thought.

As our nation considers what it means to be British, Grayson Perry takes a lookby  Grayson Perry and  Martin ParrWhen I first came upon the photography of Martin Parr in a colour supplement at some point in the 1980s, a very loud bell rang. Here was someone who was pointing out with laser precision the aspects of society I didn’t even know I was driven by. He framed anthropological observations that I didn’t yet know I was fascinated by.Class, identity, inidualism and belonging, what it is to be British: in these subjects, Martin’s photos are my guiding text. Often the most affecting encounters with culture are those that make concrete the wisps of feeling we have been sensing for years. For me, the photographs of Martin Parr did just that, and I’m sure they have done the same thing for millions of other people all over the planet.Since that encounter, his work has been a guiding beacon for me, pointing out patterns and dissonances in society, but more importantly showing me how to look. Over his long and prolific career – he has produced more than 100 books and many more exhibitions – Martin has developed an anthropological “satnav” that will take him to where his hyper-developed image-making skills can play and disrupt. His genius is not just in spotting the shot, but in booking the flight and getting the access.What I sensed in those photographs from the off was an ambivalence about the subjects that I shared. I look at images of county ladies stuffing their faces, tourists trapped in clichés, drunken revellers and the jolly grim British working classes, and they all seem to be hovering uncomfortably between comedy and tragedy.Humour bleeds through all these photographs, but also compassion. “How dare you take yourself seriously?” they say, but then “Let’s celebrate that impulse” – in a quietly bonkers, British way, naturally.Like all great artists, Parr has altered how we see the world. We see a queue of posh people, a buffet served on a Union Jack tablecloth or a lurid beach scene and we think of his work. He is one of the foremost chroniclers of our times.He sees our tender aspirations, our vanities, our sincere enthusiasms, our anachronistic traditions, our often unpredictable ersity – and he both ribs us and applauds us, blinded by his flash and decked in saturated colour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00e0dd82abc72515416cecf5f52e76d46cab031e/0_0_1299_1890/master/1299.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e582ae33040542f07165936e3b9c55e 720w","title":"aston martin full year figures float value performance","story":"Stock market value has dropped £2bn but financial performance has been strongThe luxury car firm Aston Martin Lagonda is gearing up for its first set of financial results since a disappointing stock market float.The slow-motion slide has left the 106-year-old company with a stock market value of less than £3bn, compared to its pre-listing target of £5bn.At the time, the chief executive, Andy Palmer, said the company’s profitability since the start of the year put it on course to meet full-year targets, helping to fund the development of new models such as the crossover model DBX, to be built at its new factory in St Athan, south Wales.Aston Martin’s wealthier clientele means it is insulated from the grim economic conditions facing more mass-market carmakers, which are wrestling with a global capacity glut, stagnant consumer demand and the need to invest in electric vehicle development.But it has said it is not immune to the dangers posed by Brexit, particularly a no-deal scenario, joining carmakers such as Honda, Toyota, Nissan and BMW in sounding the alarm.The company has drawn up contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components or bring them in via naval ports.With just over a month to go, the company is expected to face further questions about the effect of a no-deal scenario, which its chief financial officer, Mark Wilson, told the business select committee in 2017 would be “semi-catastrophic” for the company.In the run-up to last year’s stock market float, Aston Martin showed off its plans to boost revenue by selling luxury goods such as apartments and even personal submarines, under the stewardship of Marek Reichman, chief creative officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f5912653a4fbb5dd8620217eccc2851172919a/189_421_2364_1419/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7df4dd17843706d7327266a2c3d22d70","title":"metro bank needs to win back citys trust after loans blunder","story":"Despite profits surge, analysts likely to focus on error when bank reports on Wednesday Bank sees itself as an industry agitator, having burst on to the UK banking scene in 2010 with an eccentric American founder, dog-friendly branches and a flamboyant celebration of high street expansion that distinguished the lender from cost-cutting rivals.The bank – which calls its customers “fans”– has steadily expanded its network of “stores” and rallied enthusiasm for new openings with street parties and staff conga lines that have fostered a reputation for having a cult-like workforce.It has also dodged shareholder rebellions over multimillion pound payments to the architecture business of Shirley Hill, the wife of founder turned chairman Vernon Hill, and brushed off concerns about the circumstances of his departure from the US lender Commerce Bancorp.But 10 years on from its founding, the bank is steeling itself for a grilling over an accounting blunder. Bank revealed last month that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms, and should have been among its “risk-weighted assets” (RWAs). While the bank originally suggested that it had discovered the issue itself, it later emerged that the error was caught by the UK regulator.The chairman, who has golfed with Donald Trump and often has his Yorkshire Terrier in tow, and the chief executive, Craig Donaldson, are understood to have spoken privately with shareholders following the accounting blunder.But this Wednesday will mark the first opportunity for investors, analysts and media to question  Bank’s leadership openly about the gaffe. It is likely to overshadow a full-year earnings report that is expected to show profits surging from £15.9m to £39m, according to consensus estimates collected by Reuters.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It looks like the initial mistake was genuine, but it still clearly raises questions about ’s capabilities, and the profitability of the loans it’s been making under the wrong assumptions. The mischaracterisation of the way the error was uncovered, though, compounded the issue, and further erodes trust in the bank.”John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, admitted that he was “nervous” heading into this week’s earnings results, which could signal a further slowdown in growth and prompt a further share sell-off.“There will be a major focus on what levers the management team is planning to pull to minimise capital raising needs, as well as get the business back on track to deliver double-digit returns for shareholders, in line with their stated targets – which have been called into question now,” he said.But the bank has been riding high in recents weeks. As well as Friday’s award of £120m to help to develop its business banking proposition, a customer survey by the Competition and Markets Authority showed that  Bank ranking highest for personal account services. Khalaf said the City’s eroded confidence in the bank is “unlikely to spill out of the square mile into the UK high street and ’s customers, but if  wants to raise fresh capital in future, it’s the City it needs to turn to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1432ae7c95ee2bf7d5d3072947e1bb63c266840d/0_207_5113_3067/master/5113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ed02e43311bd1ffa0bd87d1287c0b5d","title":"poles return east higher wages job uk lose brexit","story":"Britain is sending all the wrong messages pre-Brexit to the migrant workers it sorely needsA perception had built up over the decade leading to Brexit that Britain was a country out of control. Brussels bureaucrats controlled our lives and money. Migrants were stealing jobs and sponging benefits, or so went the shock doctrine of the tabloid press, manifested among the myriad reasons 17.4 million people cried out from the ballot box two and a half years ago: “Enough is enough.”But as the countdown on Brexit approaches its chaotic finale in little more than 30 days’ time, it’s worth remembering that, until recently, that perception hadn’t travelled far overseas.Britain was held in high esteem among migrant workers, particularly from the former eastern bloc. Our economy offered them better pay, greater opportunity, higher living standards and more rewarding work than at home.There was a special view of Britain in Poland in particular. Our nations had stood shoulder to shoulder through some of the most significant moments of the last century. Britain welcomed the Polish armed forces during the war.After Poland joined the EU in 2004, the number of Poles in Britain surged to reach almost a million. Polish became the second-most spoken language in 2013 (coincidentally, the year David Cameron promised the in-out EU referendum to placate the Blukip surge in his party only to see the purple populists usurp him), while Poles replaced Indians as the largest diaspora in 2015.Britain benefited from the arrival of these workers. Community tensions may have been very real at times, but it was austerity that stretched public services to breaking point, not migrants. EU workers helped to grow the British economy out of the last recession. The research from economists is clear: migrants contribute more than they extract.Britain’s old reputation now lies in tatters. The message is clear: we want your money, but not your people. Eastern Europeans no longer flock to Britain quite the reverse.Figures last week showed that 76,000 EU workers left last year, while the number of non-EU migrant workers rose by 159,000. Fresh statistics expected on Thursday are likely to show the decline continuing.Among those contemplating their future is Maciej Artur, a 51-year old engineer in the energy industry from Nottingham. Britain’s reputation as a dear old friend rang true when he brought his family here in 2007. He now has mixed feelings after receiving abuse, which has intensified since the launch of the referendum campaign.“Why did I have to explain to my younger daughter why people in her class started to call her a Polish bitch?” Artur asks. “I’ve been told I was a foreigner and I could get the fuck off.” Like many, Artur is considering moving his family back to Poland. But while the xenophobia he and other eastern Europeans have experienced is among the biggest push factors for leaving, economic reasons also colour the decision, as the gap closes between the dwindling British economy and the emerging strength of their home nations. Artur says he has plenty of job offers in Poland or elsewhere in the EU as alternatives.The post-Brexit continuation of rights for EU citizens pledged by the prime minister also rings hollow. Artur was incensed by May warning that migrants would no longer be able to “jump the queue”. He plans to visit Poland next month and is worried that he might not be allowed to return. “Until it is made law, it’s still her words. Look at what she’s promised before and now how things are. My level of trust in her word is not very high.”Much has been made of the reasons why Britain is now less attractive for EU migrant workers since the Brexit vote, from rising intolerance to the drop in the value of the pound making British wages less appealing. Less has been said about the improving economic conditions in the countries many migrant workers came from.Brexiters might argue that pay in Britain has been held back by migrant labour during that time and has started to rise as eastern European workers leave. But most academics disagree. According to the government’s independent Migration Advisory Committee, EEA migration has had only a small impact on wages and employment. It brought “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”. Oxford Economics reckons that the average migrant from the rest of Europe contributed about £2,300 more to UK public finances in 2016-17 than the average UK-born adult.To be sure, wages and living standards in much of eastern Europe still lag behind the EU. Should the current rate of convergence continue, it would still take until 2053 for Poland to match the eurozone average wage, until 2059 to match Britain and 2077 to level with the leading EU country, Germany, according to the Grant Thornton analysis.Britain, on the other hand faces, growing skills shortages as workers leave. Unfilled vacancies are at their highest since records began, nearing a million empty roles. Too few migrant staff to fill the hospitality and food industries, in particular, could lead to shortages and higher prices for consumers. Eastern Europeans heading home will prove a loss to Britain.For Artur, the combination of economic decisions and rising hostility is weighing on his mind ahead of 29 March. He’s concerned about his two teenage daughters’ career chances in the event that he keeps his family in Brexit Britain, potentially shorn from access from the EU jobs market.“I’m old enough to remember how it is to live in country that is a satellite, that is not a member of the European Union,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245341ad96a5e22663c268509200ade3b7af500e/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=783ef2d5b0d3beabf9e85bc7b0a11785","title":"disrupt brexit mps the independent group","story":"One of the great lessons of the 20th century is that history has no direction: as Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper argued, and as the transformative upheavals of 1989 showed to thrilling effect, there is no secular version of providence, no ideological script to follow. So it has been alarming, in the past few years, to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion.The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally. Labour, meanwhile, is in thrall to the old left determinism, in which all the core debates have long since been settled, devotion to the leadership must be absolute, and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness. For those of us who believe in pluralist politics, it has been a depressing spectacle, a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty, unpredictable reality of 21st-century life. Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the 11-strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing.I have been sceptical in the past about the notion of a new centre party – but am pleased to have been (thus far) confounded. As Heidi Allen and Luciana Berger showed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the group has no intention of being pressed into announcing policies prematurely, rushing to form a party hierarchy, or of seeking to disguise their differences. Instead, they are turning these disagreements into a strength and striving – in Chuka Umunna’s words – to be “culturally different”. They will prosper to the extent that they make good this promise. They must put strategy before tactics (incredibly hard). They cannot afford to look like the liberal elite demanding its job back. They must be rigorous in addressing new challenges rather than re-litigating old battles. They must continue to act with dignity in the face of seething social media fury – especially strong from some Corbynites, whose treatment of the escapees has been reminiscent of Scientology’s hounding of “suppressive persons”.But what the independents have already done is important: more important, perhaps, than the formation of the Social Democratic party in 1981. The “gang of four” was a breakaway faction of the Labour party. The Independent Group has genuinely bipartisan roots. And – unlike the SDP – it is starting its life in the crucible of a full-blown constitutional crisis.Whether it succeeds or fails, it has already acted as a much-needed solvent of the certainties that have paralysed Westminster during the Brexit process. It has reintroduced the indeterminacy principle to mainstream politics and, most specifically, shown those who fetishise the 2016 referendum result as if it were the burning bush of our era – a quasi-ine mandate – that leaving the EU is still, as a matter of fact, entirely voluntary. We can still step away from the precipice, if we choose, as a nation, to do so.Even as the 11 coalesced, three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – published a truly remarkable article in the Daily Mail signalling their support for an extension of article 50 to prevent a no-deal outcome “if there is no breakthrough in the coming week”. It is hard to exaggerate the significance of this intervention. Theresa May’s defining mission – her reason for remaining in the job – is to take Britain out of the EU on 29 March. With a degree of repetition remarkable even by her standards, she has said that no-deal must stay on the table as a bargaining chip.Rudd, Gauke and Clark have issued a flagrant challenge to this, the last sacred principle of Mayism. And they have done so, thus far, with impunity. They know full well that a formal delay would smash to pieces the framework within which the Commons has operated since backing the government’s article 50 bill in February 2017.It would, for a start, dramatically oxygenate the argument in favour of a further referendum. It is already gaining fresh momentum, as Labour edges towards something approaching endorsement. In his fractious Sky News interview last week, Jeremy Corbyn made clear that he still loathes the idea, and would only countenance a public vote on a Labour deal: a precondition of which, presumably, would be the election of a Labour government. Deputy leader Tom Watson came much closer to the centre of gravity of opinion in his party on Sunday, when he said that Labour should back a fresh referendum if May rejects the party’s five-point Brexit plan (which she already has). This week, even though the meaningful vote has been postponed again, MPs will be given the chance to vote on Yvette Cooper’s amendment that would seize control of the parliamentary agenda and require the prime minister to seek such an extension (unless a deal is reached by 13 March). In January, Cooper’s binding proposal was defeated by a margin of 23 votes – while Caroline Spelman’s nonbinding motion against no-deal secured a majority of eight. In other words: we’d like to do the right thing, but we’re not allowed to. Sorry.On Wednesday, there will be only 30 days left until the official Brexit date. If that doesn’t focus the mind, I don’t know what will. Those wavering MPs who still feel constrained by narrow ideological loyalties, the haranguing of the whips, the dead slogans of a three-year-old campaign, should look at the 11 MPs who decided to cast aside those chains. They should ask themselves whether, for once, the claims of the public interest, of common sense and of future generations might just trump all else. They should ask: if not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b4d36d03337e9a2d4e916595fc4b36d825c1b0/0_87_3084_1850/master/3084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0b42abdf3825e6d43fc27f70b415ba","title":"politics the independent group local communities westminster","story":"The launch of the new Independent Group was a golden opportunity to do politics differently.

This, categorically, is not a new politics – because that wouldn’t be about them, it would be about us.This is what those MPs should have done to demonstrate a new politics. They would have gone anywhere but Westminster – to a vibrant community hub, for example. They would have brought together lots of different people, from varied backgrounds, especially the young. They would have sat with them, not in front of them. The people would have talked first and the politicians would have responded. It would have been live streamed with people asking questions and making points from wherever they were. Climate change would have been a key issue.Once the lights went off, the politicians would have stayed a long time to hear the stories, the hopes and the ambitions of the people in the room. They would then have dispersed to different towns and places to listen and learn more about what’s happening to our nation, what’s going wrong and what amazing things are already happening to put things right. And they would have pledged to keep on doing that.Crucially, all of this would not have been a preamble to going back to parliament to plot and plan. In this parallel world, the ex-Labour MPs would have recognised that amid all the wicked and wonderful complexity of the 21st century and the challenges we face, from loneliness to Brexit, the solutions aren’t going to be imposed on us, but created by us. This isn’t a prediction, it’s an observation.In communities across the country, people aren’t waiting for politicians to pronounce: they know politics is broken. So they are getting on and doing things for themselves – mostly together and often boosted by the incredible power of social media. Caring, sharing, building, making and organising are happening at unprecedented rates because the demand is there and it is now easier than ever to do. A simple hashtag puts you in touch with everyone, locally, nationally and globally, who wants to decide things and do things like you, and with you.All this is far from the gaze of Westminster. It’s local and specific. It’s in the yawning chasms where human needs aren’t being met by either the austerity-driven state or the free market. But while all this activity is vibrant, creative and energetic, it’s also fragile. It’s happening despite the political system, not because of it. It is under-resourced and often reliant on the furious activity of one or just a few people. It needs the state to help resource it and legitimise it, to join it up, scale it up and accelerate it so that this collaborative action becomes the new way society decides things and does things in the 21st century. So that instead of being cogs in bureaucratic machines, or mere consumers of what is put before us, we become active citizens.A new report from the thinktank that I chair, Compass, calls this potential meeting point of bottom-up emerging activity and top-down state support 45° Change – the diagonal faultline through which a new society can and must emerge. This line is the place for a truly new politics. This is the gap in the market and the Independent Group missed it. Sadly, they even got their name wrong: this is not the age of independence, it’s the age of interdependence.Just what is at stake is illustrated by an even bigger story from last week than the Independent Group launch, the announcement of the closure of the Swindon Honda plant. A proud town is now in despair, but there wasn’t a thing the council, the area’s MPs or the government could do. This is why people know politics is broken: power has been separated from political control. Honda can just up sticks and go.But what if power could be redistributed so that it was politically effective locally, nationally and globally? In Germany, global firms are legally and financially more anchored to the place that hosts them. National governments can have much more effective industrial policies and globally, however difficult, we simply have to find ways to democratically direct international capital. The new politics has to be about the redistribution of power to where it’s most needed. And as well as transforming representative democracy, not least through proportional voting, we need to deepen democratic participation. The desire for this is evident in the surge of interest in ideas such as citizens’ assemblies.In Swindon, a new politics would help convene and crowdsource ideas about carbon-neutral industries that could utilise the incredible talent in the town and crowdfund the investment to bring it to life. Swindon has been here before when the rail industry shut up shop. The town can and must be renewed again, backed by the state, but using the techniques and assets of the 21st century.We have reasons for hope. As Henry Timms and Jeremy Heimans argue in their book, New Power, people today have “an inalienable right to participation”. The driving forces of the 21st-century networked society are centripetal, not centrifugal they inexorably draw energy away from the centre. The Westminster model can’t function in a world of networks and rapid climate change because it was made for a world long gone. Brexit will inevitably, and rightly, dominate the headlines in the next few days and weeks. But this seismic shock to our body politic is merely a symptom of the democratic decay that needs to be addressed whether or not we leave the EU. We need a politics that’s genuinely and transformatively new. But it won’t be found behind podiums for elites in Westminster. It will be built on platforms for everyone.• Neal Lawson is chair of the pressure group Compass and spokesperson for the Progressive Alliance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a7a2fed3d98f6132985f06217905236af78bc7/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7ff10acda1b75866bc37e9a8a55f07f","title":"shamima begum sajiv javid","story":"The home secretary, Sajid Javid, might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week. But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol.However, it is entirely predictable. I think of my first reaction: not compassion, but anger at the abhorrent views she expressed about Islamic State’s victims. If I had loved ones killed by these terrorists I like to think I’d be one of those amazing souls who moves quickly to forgive. But I suspect I’d be in the “lock her up and throw away the key” brigade.On one level we, the public, don’t have to work through the discombobulating mix of disgust and pity she inspires. You don’t have to deny she is responsible for any crimes she may have committed in order to think she should be brought back to the UK to be held accountable. Once she’s back, we can leave assessing guilt to the courts.There is a danger in allowing the vilification of Begum to go unchallenged. Turning someone into a monster is a protection mechanism: it absolves us from thinking about moral complexity. It permits us to consign evil deeds to a place beyond the pale of understanding. But we lose something important if we don’t try to understand how evil manifests itself: the capacity to prevent it.Take child abuse. Studies suggest we view its causes as “deep and immutable”, so evil that it’s inexplicable. That leads us to believe that the only way to prevent it is to find the evil people and lock them up. To see it as preventable through other means, such as therapeutic interventions, which research shows is possible, is to render child abusers too human for comfort. Understanding feels too close to absolution.In counselling the need for greater understanding of Begum’s actions, some have drawn parallels with the grooming of young girls by paedophile gangs in places such as Rotherham. It’s an analogy that leaves me deeply uncomfortable. Yes, grooming techniques were used on Begum. But in the one case, girls as young as 10 were groomed purely for sexual exploitation in the other, yes, a 15-year old was married, albeit willingly, to a man almost twice her age. But Isis grooms young men and women to fight for a terrorist force that commits genocide. That’s why I find the “she’s nothing more than a child victim” line hard to swallow. What if someone who was radicalised as a child goes on to commit terrible atrocities as an adult? It’s not a hypothetical we don’t know the extent of Begum’s crimes, but radicals have committed atrocities in the name of Isis.Begum’s case reminds me more of a book I read as a teenager – the 1981 novel The Wave, based on events at a California high school. A class of students struggles to understand why ordinary Germans stood by as the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews. Their teacher sets up an authoritarian membership organisation that demands absolute obedience from its members. Things escalate quickly into violence. The story ends with an assembly to unveil the new leader of a national movement to create youth wings across other schools. An image of Adolf Hitler is projected on to the screen. It also brings to mind the Stanford prison experiment, in which a psychology professor randomly assigned volunteers to be “guards” or “prisoners” in a two-week prison simulation. Within a few days some guards were psychologically abusing and torturing prisoners.The common thread in both is that ordinary people can be induced to act in unsavoury ways, through indoctrination or simulated conditions. And indoctrination is part of the radicalisation process Times reporter Anthony Loyd describes how Begum displays the hallmarks of other indoctrinated jihadists he’s interviewed before.Perhaps those of us who have never had our capacity to commit evil under malign influence tested are lucky, rather than pure. That’s one reason to be grateful for the rule of law. Another is that it allows us the luxury of kneejerk reaction because we’re not in charge of meting out punishment ourselves.But Javid, by weighing in to use powers that politicians have awarded themselves to deprive Begum of citizenship without due process, is messing with that. He’s starting us on the slippery slope to trial by public opinion. And vigilante justice has tragic consequences one of the worst examples is the man who, mistaken for a paedophile, was brutally beaten up and set alight five years ago. In recent years, eight people have killed themselves after being labelled paedophiles by vigilante hunters.Holocaust survivor Primo Levi said: “Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.” Nothing I have read suggests Begum is a monster. I wonder how many of us would be functionaries in the wrong circumstances. We like to think we embrace the rule of law because we’re better people. But what if we’re better people because we embrace the rule of law? That, ultimately, is why Javid’s actions are so troubling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01ae6e1d2ba1b7ae8d1a6325057fcff27c93e20/0_108_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af616d417455472737d666064f86ecde","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

UKEF has increased its exposure to the oil sector, according to its latest annual report, due to opportunities in Asia and South America.And the agency said it was ready to support more fossil fuel projects overseas. “There is a pipeline of new business in both the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors given the strong credentials of UK exporters in these areas,” it said.Recent projects supported by the UK include oil and gas fields off the coast of Ghana, a major gas pipeline in Oman and software for an oil firm in Argentina.A UKEF spokesperson said: “The UK government’s priority, at home and abroad, is to encourage international opportunities for UK businesses – ensuring they can build fruitful relationships with overseas partners and contribute to economic growth around the world.“We are committed to high standards of environmental, social and human rights risk management.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4700ddc3d43de1f64f5e18a955decccd219aa627/0_0_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b98663815847541af056512e85195","title":"the 12 key shows from milan fashion week in pictures","story":"From Gucci’s power suiting to a gameshow that inspired Jeremy Scott for this season’s runway for Moschino, Jo Jones picks her 10 highlights from the autumnwinter 2019 shows"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1ecfb52ff18b79162d41337057e9b223d8a1f5/0_429_2480_2478/master/2480.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5431724c4e45fa90aa53c298ff26099e 480w","title":"oscars 2019 predictions timetable and all you need to know for the big night","story":"The 91st Academy Awards have finally arrived: here’s what you need to know, when you need to know it by and who (we think) will win the key prizes• Full list of nominations for the 2019 OscarsAnd now, the end is near … This year’s Oscar season has been the most fractious in memory: not only have many of the contenders been given the third degree for various failings, but the ceremony itself – the old standby of reliably dull TV – has been pulled this way and that with a series of messed-up tweaks that have served mainly to enrage the Oscars own membership. Whether it’s the Kevin Hart debacle, the farrago over ad-break presentations, or the attempt to axe the non-famous songs, it’s safe to say it hasn’t gone well. So far.So putting all that aside, what have we actually got? We still don’t know if there’ll be a surprise host (Whoopi Goldberg was being talked up as a last-minute possible), though it seems clear various attention-grabbing names have been frogmarched in to do some sort of podium duty. The Academy have backed away from all their various publicly-floated proposals to trim the running time, but they have pledged to keep it to three hours, so we will have to wait and see what they ditch. (Here’s a suggestion: those skincrawling comedy bits designed to go viral .)As the awards themselves, there’s been a pleasing lack of consensus on what and who should win what. The Favourite and Roma both have 10 nods, but that doesn’t mean much at the best of times. Quite a few of the contenders have muddied the waters themselves: Green Book for the idiocies of its director and writer, Roma for its trousering of Netflix’s marketing budget, Bohemian Rhapsody for Bryan Singer. No one can really be confident, least of all because the guild awards – normally pretty reliable indicator as its basically the same voters – have garlanded completely different films this year. The only dead certs look like Rami Malek and his ’tache for Bohemian Rhapsody and – much lower down the list – Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse for best animated feature. You would assume Glenn Close would be the sentimental favourite for The Wife. Other than that, all bets appear to be off.As usual, your hardworking  team will be on the case. Stuart Heritage is our own master of ceremonies on the live blog, the fashion team will be checking out the red carpet, Peter Bradshaw will be casting his world-weary eye over the results, and Hadley Freeman is our spy at the after-parties. So while we wait for all that to get going, here are a few pointers as to what to look out for and some final predictions.It all kicks off on Sunday 24 February, in the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. The Oscars live telecast starts at 5pm (PST)8pm (EST) – that translates to 1am (GMT) on Monday in London and 12 noon (AEDT) on Monday in Sydney. You can watch it live on ABC in the US, Sky TV in the UK, and Channel 9 in Australia. Red carpet junkies can start watching three hours earlier – 2pm (PST)5pm (EST)11pm (GMT)9am (AEDT) – on the E! TV channel. And the show itself is going to be three hours long. Got that? THREE HOURS.At this stage, we’re all punchdrunk. Who knows? Peter Bradshaw has already had his say, so you might want to refresh your memory. The bookies have their own theories, but – you know – I don’t think they know much about films.  writers have been advancing arguments on behalf of all the best picture nominees, and now we’re even more confused. Time to stick our fingers in our ears and belch out a few last minute picksguesses.Best picture The FavouriteBest director Spike Lee, BlacKkKlansmanBest actor Rami Malek, Bohemian RhapsodyBest actress Glenn Close, The WifeBest supporting actor Richard E Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me?Best supporting actress Regina King, If Beale Street Could TalkBest original screenplay The FavouriteBest adapted screenplay BlacKkKlansmanBest documentary RBGBest original song Shallow, A Star Is BornBest animated feature Spider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseBest foreign language film Roma•A host?

But they traditionally kick off with the best supporting actor gong, which a little while back looked nailed on for Mahershala Ali.

Either you start with the food, then look for a bottle with a range of attributes that will bring out the best in ingredients, or at least not clash with them, casting the wine in the role of condiment. Or you start with the wine, worrying more about avoiding anything (spice, sugar, acid) that will prevent the precious liquid from displaying its charms.Either direction can result in one of those moments when wine and food elevate each other in blissful harmony. The most perceptive dispensers of wine and food matching advice – Fiona Beckett, Joanna Simon and Victoria Moore – are equal parts wine and food lovers who are happy with either route. Moore’s The Wine Dine Dictionary is all about cross-referencing ingredients and wine styles in joyously creative but practical and flexible ways.But there’s a third approach, an anti-philosophy that sees specific and elaborate matches as pretentious and unnecessary. It says: “Enough of telling me this grand cru chablis can only work with turbot au beurre blanc! Stop worrying, put a few bottles on the table and let us all have a good time.”I like my food and wine matching advice the same way I like my recipes – the more precise the better. If I’ve paid attention to balancing flavours in a dish, why would I fill my glass with something that jars like morning orange juice after toothpaste?Fortunately for the “just bung the bottles on the table” school, the wine lists of our better restaurants increasingly have their backs. It’s striking how many sit near the centre of a Venn diagram of particular vinous styles. There are fresh, lower-alcohol, higher-acid reds, either from cool climate areas or from warmer regions where the grapes have been picked earlier for freshness white and orange wines with a spine of acidity but a fuller body (and maybe some tannins) from extended contact with the skins during fermentation or the dead yeast cells during ageing structured, fuller-flavoured and deeper coloured rosés.These are wines that offer the greatest range of possibilities, that can be shared with meals of multiple small plates, or on tables with many guests and orders. They make matching easy, all the while reminding us that a wine that is not up to drinking with at least some foods doesn’t really qualify as wine at all.Di Lenardo Gossip Pinot Grigio RamatoFriuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy 2017 (from £14.95, dorsetwine corksofbristol )While most pinot grigio is made as a white wine, the skins have a grey-purple tint.

The rice calms, the citrus notes invigorate. It is what I call a balanced diet.Sour, sharp, citrus notes are a signature of this kitchen. Blackcurrants, gooseberries and limes in summer. Rhubarb, yuzu, lemon and tamarind in winter. The snap of a lime leaf brings a bowl of soup to life.

After all, just last Thursday Rodgers trumpeted Celtic’s elimination from the Europa League by Valencia as “one of the proudest moments I’ve had as a coach or a manager … we were so superior in the game … our shape was absolutely brilliant”.Rodgers, who in the buildup to the 1-0 defeat had dismissed suggestions he needed to adapt his overly intricate approach to improve results against top European sides, praised vindication in defeat. His team, he said, had played well only to be undone by misfortune and the odd inidual error. Sound familiar? Puel spent most of the past year saying similar things, albeit with a less cheery demeanour. After the 4-1 home walloping on Saturday by Crystal Palace, Leicester could bear no more such talk from the Frenchman.The thing is, Puel often had a point, just as Rodgers did on Thursday. The difference is that Rodgers has more credibility at Celtic thanks to his domestic success and a more obvious bond with his environment, whereas Puel’s record in Britain consists of stints at Southampton and Leicester during which he seldom appeared to be at one with his surrounds, seemingly on the brink of dismissal even in the moment when his team looked close to formidable.Puel arrived at Leicester on a difficult mission: to move away from the counterattacking team who sensationally won the title in 2016 and gradually introduce younger and more nifty players at the expense of the dwindling or departed champions. It was always going to take time and risk making dissenters of influential players who would not react kindly to being told they or their ways are too old. Puel’s style of man-management does not appear to have smoothed that process. And too often he seemed to embrace transition out of dogma rather than necessity – such as when he fielded experimental teams in cup ties that fans dearly wanted to win. The manager was out of tune there. A successor might be more savvy on that front. But still Puel’s replacement will occasionally feel obliged to omit, say, the 32-year-old Jamie Vardy, just as Puel did and just as Rodgers famously did to Steven Gerrard with Liverpool in a Champions League match at Real Madrid.Vardy has been in iffy form this season and publicly admitted to being uncomfortable with the way the manager wanted to play. Kasper Schmeichel and others also had misgivings. The methodical possession‑based game that Puel advocated was often decried as too slow and predictable, and not just by fans. After one of the highlights of Puel’s reign, December’s exhilarating 2-1 win over Manchester City, Harry Maguire hinted that it was made possible by an all-too-rare instruction to go “toe-to-toe” with opponents. “Hopefully we can learn from that, I feel that’s when were at our best,” said Maguire.With more time Leicester might have learned to play regularly with such precision and at such a tempo, but Puel could not convince enough people at the club that they were heading that way. He always seemed to have problems getting his message through.Some young players made exciting progress under him, notably Ben Chilwell, James Maddison and recently Harvey Barnes. Perhaps Rodgers, another manager who is good at rearing young talents, will relish building on those gains. But other young players did not make the strides as hoped under Puel, such as Demarai Gray, Hamza Choudhury and even Kelechi Iheanacho, who has been a flop since joining in 2017.Leicester have got too many transfers wrong (Riyad Mahrez out, Rachid Ghezzal in) since their title win and, unless the club hang on to the recently arrived loanee midfielder Youri Tielemans beyond this summer, then Puel’s replacement will need to add a new spine to a promising team.Still, Puel had enough good players to do better than he did. One telling sign of a persistent disconnect between Puel and his team was the regularity with which Leicester started matches badly. Even against Palace, when they actually bucked that trend, they contrived to concede the first goal of the game, the 19th time that has happened in 27 matches this season. In the end, Leicester decided Puel had been given enough chances to make amends. He leaves behind some good work, a promising team and significant room for improvement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d89ce4f35030c30779a0957b5d53abf7e84233/0_219_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d4df4591fc6dcd18bcb1dd2f9f5be44","title":"manchester united liverpool premier league match report","story":"If Liverpool wished to signal serious intent of ending their 29-year wait to be champions they failed.

He’s in the Sky studio and has already slipped a few “we” in. Meanwhile De Bruyne delivers a dangerous ball from and right and, eventually, Fernandinho fires well over from range.47 min: Pedro immediately makes a nice run down the right, is felled, and wins Chelsea a chance to load the box. Willian delivers into what is actually a very good area in the Corridor Of Uncertainty, but they clear didn’t load the box well enough because nobody attacks it.Manchester City substitution: Kompany for Laporte (hamstring).Don’t forget that if it’s still like this in around 50 minutes’ time, we will have extra-time. If that’s to be the case, let’s hope it has at least opened up a bit by then.Chucky writes: “How many 0-0s is that from the top clubs this week across comps? Too many defensive coaches! Boring as.”I think Jonathan Wilson had a point here. The pendulum always swings.Regarding that question on London clubs at Wembley, Phil West has crunched some of the numbers so the rest of us didn’t have to:“Since 1900 (according to Wiki) London clubs playing non-London clubs in the FA Cup final are 28-14 ahead. There are also a few occasions where two London teams were involved, but I ignored them. I’m not sure if this means anything though – as years ago it was quite common for less successful teams to have a cup run only to lose in the final. Comparing results since the year 2007 gives a 6-2 score in favour of London teams.”Nobody would say this has been much good. But, in fairness to Chelsea, it’s probably gone as Sarri intended. They have kept City at arm’s length and limited them to half-chances at best.45+2 min: Almost severe embarrassment for Otamendi as he heads a Chelsea free-kick towards his own goal, with no opposition player near, and sees it fly only narrowly wide as Ederson es desperately! So Chelsea have a corner with the half’s last action, but it causes no danger.45 min: First real bit of spark from Hazard, who does well to outdo Laporte but then, with men arriving very late in support, tries to do a bit too much in a tight space and sees City eventually block his attempt on goal.43 min: Another City corner, now, and they’re applying some real pressure again. David Luiz beats Laporte to it, but that’s not the end of the story. Zinchenko plays the ball in again and Otamendi – ghosting in at the back post as a minute previously – gets a toe to the ball but not with enough power to beat Kepa.42 min: Willian concedes a free-kick on the right after Chelsea lose the ball in their own half three times in quick succession while passing out aimlessly in pursuit of nothing. It’s another very dangerous area. De Bruyne’s cross again goes beyond everybody but Sterling, delivering from the left, sees his ball kept alive acrobatically by Otemendi at the far post. It looks good, but Chelsea clear.39 min: De Bruyne, with a smart touch past David Luiz, reaches the byline but overhits his cross. Sterling, on the other side, twists Azpilicueta about sublimely at first but eventually runs out of space and Chelsea earn a goal kick.37 min: It really has been low on excitement so far, let’s be honest. Sarri has gone for Get A Result And Save My Job tactics, and I’ve seen nothing to suggest they don’t have a chance of squeaking it out that way. City aren’t moving the ball as they can and chances aren’t really coming.34 min: It’s not much but we are seeing a bit more from Chelsea now. Kante tries to get away down the right but can’t reach it. City still have the initiative though and force an awkward hack away from Rudiger just outside the six-yard box.32 min: Chelsea enjoy a little play around the City box, now, and Fernandinho has to be well positioned to stop Hazard latching onto a floated Jorginho ball into the area.31 min: ... which is delivered by De Bruyne, who has been quiet so far, but Chelsea cope just fine.30 min: That’s a deserved yellow card for David Luiz, who agriculturally dumps Bernardo Silva over as the City man wriggles deftly away from him near the right byline. Dangerous free-kick here ...28 min: A shot on target from Aguero, who links with David Silva before firing one from 20 yards, slightly deflected, that Kepa es onto and holds.So, in fairness, it’s going as Sarri probably hoped.26 min: But now Chelsea do have an attack, sweeping upfield adroitly, and earn a free-kick midway inside the City half, a little to the right. It’s their first real chance to put some pressure on. Willian arrows it to the back stick, Pedro heads down but nobody is poised to latch onto it.25 min: If you were Hazard you’d probably rather be in Madrid than chasing waste paper like this.22 min: Best bit of action so far – Bernardo Silva floats a lovely right-to-left ball over Azpilicueta and Aguero, deep inside the box, chests down and sets himself before lashing over from an awkward angle.21 min: Little comes of it. But it’s only City doing any attacking. We’ve not seen Hazard at all yet!20 min: Maybe possession from the back will die and football will evolve to the extent that, in five years’ time, everyone is playing percentage football and the real heroes are a generation of miniature Dave Bassetts. While we ponder that, Rudiger defends well from a dangerous Bernardo Silva ball and it’s another City corner.18 min: Some fairly heavy City pressure, now, but Luiz clears two crosses from the left. Chelsea are sitting off until City get 15 yards into their half.17 min: Kepa looks dodgy with the ball at his feet so far, which doesn’t help the previous point.16 min: The thing is that Chelsea *insist* on passing the ball around from the back even though there are no options to progress the move and City keep pressing them aggressively. So the ball gets given away every single time. I know it’s the way everyone has to play now but it so often becomes frayed and useless. You’re probably not going to score the perfect goal from there, guys, so why not do it as and when?13 min: Laporte feeds David Silva in a nice little pocket of space but his touch uncharacteristically lets him down. It’s been a reasonably drab start, overall.12 min: JR in Illinois is frothing –“Have you re-watched what Jorginho did to Aguero in the first second of the game? It was not a ‘stray arm’ by Jorginho. It was a deliberate elbow aimed squarely at Aguero’s face. He didn’t make a clean connection, just a glancing blow, but it was as clear a red card offence as you’d want to see. And Moss was standing five feet away. Unbelievable.”I’ll have to watch again at half-time. It would – and seemingly should – have been pretty much the quickest red card in history!10 min: Fairly clear, now, that Chelsea are taking the conservative approach. But they cause a flutter now as a long switch from Emerson beats a badly positioned Laporte and almost sends Kante running clear. He is blocked off, legally, by Zinchenko but there were some brief howls of anguish from their fans.8 min: The referee is Jonathan Moss, by the way. City keep pressing but Chelsea are offering up some spicy challenges and don’t look like giving up chances easily just now. Rudiger has stepped in well a couple of times already.5 min: Yes, it’s a good start from City and now Aguero benefits from a ricochet and surges down the right, claiming a handball after a defender blocks his cross. Nothing is given.3 min: City keeping the ball well early on. Has Sarri gone for the template that beat them in December?1 min: Blimey – literally straight from kick-off Aguero tries to run past Jorginho and is sent flying by a stray arm. Looks very painful but he gets up, City take the free kick and then win an early corner .... which is cleared by Barkley.The death of Sarriball or the birth of something beautiful?It’s an interesting question, to be fair. I doubt if I can find the answers in the next four minutes, but if anyone has stats to hand then do whack them over.The teams are striding out at Wembley right now – there’ll be meeting, greeting, pleasantries, anthems, and then we’ll be away!Oh gosh, yes, and shame on me because I’m writing this a mere hop, skip, jump from Arsenal’s home. They beat Southampton 2-0 with early Lacazette and Mkhitaryan goals!Joe Pearson writes: “Perversely, with respect to Europa League qualification, it doesn’t matter who wins this final (presuming the standings hold). If Chelsea wins, they qualify automatically. If City wins, the qualification falls to ... Chelsea.”That is true and a good point. The stakes for Chelsea and Sarri are even higher than that though, I think.We were not regaled with his opinion.“Chelsea playing the same frontline that beat City 2-0 late last year,” notes Neil Bailey, and he has a point. Strange game, that was, because Chelsea got a grip of it after reverting very much to Plan B – ceding possession, basically.It finished goalless at Old Trafford, and was rather a slog. Half an hour til this one now ...Very nice from Paul Wilson, this, on how Chelsea could learn from City’s example:The quality in United v Liverpool has been ... lacking, shall we say. We’ll get better at Wembley, surely. Chelsea fans: right call to leave Higuain on the bench?Don’t know if you’ve heard, but there’s another game on at the moment. Simon Burnton will take you through the delicately-poised last knockings of Manchester United v Liverpool and then I’ll have much more from this one. Get your thoughts and predictions in to me, in the meantime!Strong from City, with Ederson in goal rather than Muric, who would usually expect to play in this competition. Guardiola is clearly desperate for the win. No Hudson-Odoi from the start for Chelsea despite his goal against Malmo on Thursday, but Jorginho and Hazard are among those to return – and Barkley starts. Higuain is on the bench. Presumably we will see Hazard as false nine, which tends to work well against lesser teams but not against good ones.The sun’s out in north London, Wembley looks resplendent, you’d almost think it is May. But this is the League Cup final, rather than the FA Cup final, and the storylines around this one might well keep us going until the latter. Manchester City will be gagging to tick off the first of a potential four trophies, and retain this one in the process, make no mistake about that. If they lose today then the chance to achieve something historic, if not massively likely, is gone. But for Chelsea there is something quite different at play.Chelsea last won this competition four years ago and would love to again. Should they fall short then you’d fancy that Maurizio Sarri is done for that Chelsea’s revamp is over before it really began and that an exhausting cycle of upheaval starts over again? It was a 6-0 defeat at City a mere fortnight ago that suggested the goose was cooked – anything close to that would surely seal the deal today although I, for one, suspect we’re in for something much chancier because that is how football tends to go.Players want to win stuff, that’s the bottom line, and Chelsea’s team of seasoned internationals will be desperate to do that today. There’s no way City are six goals better than Chelsea on a normal day this isn’t a normal day but it’s a cup final and that’s usually a great leveller. Will it be enough?My view: whatever happens today you can’t ditch Sarri, because it was obvious *before they even got him in* that he wasn’t simply an instant-results guy, that this would take a year or two to develop and if they go away from that now then, under the current ownership, Chelsea are just going to confirm themselves as a basket case. Do what City did with Pep and let things grow over a quiet-ish first campaign! Has Sarri been hoist by the petard of such a fantastic start to the season, which even saw Chelsea being breathlessly suggested as title contenders in those early weeks? I think that, too. The football in recent weeks really hasn’t been good but he needs longer to get his own people, and ideas, in – not just Jorginho, whose new status as the fans’ fall guy seems entirely unreasonable and simply a deflection.Anyway. Will today be the day it all turns for Chelsea and Sarri? Is this all just a jaunty ersion from the inevitable either way? Is it the start of something quiet fabulous for a City side who haven’t always reached last season’s heights? So much to ponder, so little time: we’re off, off and away at 4.30pm UK time.

It’s been, to be frank, a bit disappointing. Hopefully the Carabao Cup final will make up for it – follow it with Nick Ames, now, here:Here’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s response. He says Lingard, Mata and Herrera all have hamstring injuries:You’ve always got to be ready for everything, but losing three players in the first half with hamstring injuries, and probably we should have taken Marcus off as well. Henderson went through him in the first minute and that was just one of many fouls on him today. I was very concerned, but he’s a warrior and he’s a Manc, and he knows what this means. We had to keep him on, because we’d already used three subs.You come out with so many positives today. The fans, they were the 11th man today because we had half a Marcus. I can’t remember David having to make a save. We kept them out of it and we created a couple of chances where we could have scored.We’ve lost a few with muscle injuries, hamstrings. But we’ve got some good kids coming through. We’ll have 11 players on the pitch on Wednesday night as well.Jürgen Klopp says he isn’t frustrated. However, he certainly sounds frustrated:It was a strange game. We started really well, and then the injury crisis started as well. That obviously cost us rhythm. In the end we have to admit that United played with a completely new midfield, a pretty much new three up front, but we lost the rhythm and we couldn’t get it back. It was a game without a lot of highlights. It was intense of course, but for sure it’s for United a point they won and for us we lost two. When United is beatable you have to do it, and we didn’t do it. I’m not frustrated. I’ll always take what I get from the boys. It doesn’t feel world class at the moment but it’s OK, we have a point more.We didn’t play a lot of wonderful football. It was not flexible enough. The build-up from deep was OK, but then of course you need to keep the ball in the right areas, you need to shoot, and we didn’t do these things often enough.Look, form and confidence, in football you can work for it. Luck you can work for. Everything you can work for in football, but you really have to try. The attitude of the boys is not questioned, but keep cool, pass the ball around, go into the right areas. That could have happened more often, but obviously not today.Here’s Jamie Jackson’s match report from Old Trafford:“Why was an own goal subject to the offside rule?” wonders Devesh Sharma. It was the United player, who got onto the end of the free kick and turned the ball back across goal, who was offside. Anything after that was irrelevant.I’d say a clean sheet is pleasing, it’s not an easy place to come. We made all the running, didn’t create as many chances as we’d have liked. We go into every game to win, but hopefully it’s a good point at the end of the season. We’ll only know after 38 games.I don’t think we were good enough with our movement. Around the box we couldn’t open them up as often as we’d like. They’re a confident team at the moment and they’re well organised, but with the players we’ve got we’d have liked to have created more opportunities.We want to win every game, no matter who it’s against, and we know we can. So when you come off and you haven’t won it’s always disappointing. We’ve got to look where we can improve when we’ve got the ball and teams are sat back. That’s something we have to adapt to and work out how to break down.United impressed again, though. As the injuries piled up in the first half, with Liverpool dominating possession, their motivation could also have been damaged. Instead it never wavered, and they were defensively resolute throughout. Luke Shaw was named man of the match, after popping Mo Salah into his pocket and keeping him there.“It seems Klopp made the decision to attack Shaw’s flank the entire day and failed to adapt to the fact that the United left back can actually play a bit,” surmises Johnathan Kaszynski.So Liverpool return to the top of the table, but that was a really poor performance. United defended well, but were rarely stretched. Watford visit Anfield on Wednesday, and the search for a momentum-building, confidence-boosting display of thrilling attacking brio from the title-chasers will have to wait until then. Or later.90+2 mins: The match ends with Liverpool passing the ball around the halfway line before finally, desperately, tossing it into the area. United head clear, and the final whistle blows!90+1 mins: There will be just two minutes of stoppage time.90+1 mins: Lukaku’s left-footed cross from the right flies across the area and Smalling, at the far post, doesn’t throw himself at the ball when he might have turned it in. Goal kick.90 mins: Liverpool win another free kick, but Milner’s delivery is headed clear. United break but Wijnaldum fouls Young just beyond the half-way line, and is booked.88 mins: Robertson’s cross looks vaguely dangerous, but the only way Sturridge feels he can get to it is by shoving a defender, and United have a free kick.87 mins: Shaqiri, who could perhaps have created something, has spent almost all his time wide on the right and not got anywhere near goal.85 mins: Liverpool have had no brightness and invention around the penalty area. Their front three have been either injured or rubbish, and Mané’s attempt to play in Robertson ends in a goal kick.83 mins: Shaqiri deliberately brings down Rashford as United try to counter, and accepts a booking in return.82 mins: This half United’s set-piece delivery has been excellent, but their forwards repeatedly offside. Liverpool’s set-piece delivery has been poor, and this one is easily cleared.81 mins: Young is booked for tripping Milner on the right flank. Liverpool’s only shot on target all game was Sturridge’s hopeless 40-yarder in the 33rd minute.79 mins: Liverpool make their final substitution, bringing on Origi and taking off Salah, who has done pretty much nothing all game.79 mins: Liverpool still don’t really have an attacking strategy beyond getting the ball to their full-backs and hoping their crosses lead to something. Robertson’s cross leads to a corner.75 mins: United have the ball in the net, but it’s disallowed for offside! Again it’s from a free kick, which Shaw lifts into the area. It’s send back across goal and turned into his own net by Matip, but the flag is up!73 mins: Liverpool go 4-2-3-1, with Salah up front just ahead of Sturridge, and Mané and Shaqiri on the flanks.72 mins: Liverpool make their second change, bringing Shaqiri on for Henderson.71 mins: The second corner finds Matip, who was being pulled by McTominay and heads over. He wasn’t being pulled very hard, and should probably have just committed to the header rather than thinking about potential penalties.70 mins: Chance for Liverpool! Milner wins, and takes, a corner, which arrows towards Wijnaldum. But he misses his header, and the ball bounces off McTominay and out of play.68 mins: The atmosphere is incredible, the tempo is remarkable, but the quality just isn’t there at the moment.66 mins: A shot! It’s a terrible one, Wijnaldum blasting over from the edge of the area, but a shot all the same.65 mins: Liverpool control the ball for a while, but when Henderson tries to lift it into United’s area it’s immediately smashed clear. “There was better possession football in Cardiff yesterday,” sniffs Paul Fitzgerald.63 mins: Henderson hits the ball long towards Mané, and Smalling easily wins the header and turns it back to De Gea. Their over-use of long balls is not helping them.61 mins: United have upped the pace in this half, and have had the better of the play. Liverpool have not put together a passing move of any length or purpose. Another one comes to an early end with Mané misplacing a pass to McTominay.57 mins: United get numbers forward, and Lukaku has four people to aim for with his cross from the right, but it doesn’t quite drop for any of them, and Rashford eventually shoots wide from an unlikely angle.56 mins: United play the ball over the top for Rashford, but his first touch is poor and Alisson gathers.55 mins: The atmosphere seems to have increased in intensity since the interval, while United – albeit entirely from set pieces – have been more dangerous. It smells like there’s a goal coming.54 mins: It’s half-cleared to Salah, who heads down to Van Dijk, who volleys back into the mixer. Young wins it there, despite Matip kicking at him from behind, and United get a free kick.53 mins: Liverpool finally find some space in attack, Henderson running down the right, but his low cross is cut out. Corner.53 mins: Another United free kick and another free header. This time Sánchez gets his head to the ball, but he too is offside. Still, a double warning for Liverpool.51 mins: Fabinho trips McTominay and from the free kick Young lifts the ball into the area and Pogba runs free but heads at Alisson, and is anyway offside.49 mins: “This feels like a Shaqiri kind of game someone to do something unexpected for Liverpool,” suggests Hubert O’Hearn, and if Liverpool do have someone who is going to unlock United, he doesn’t seem to be on the pitch. “It won’t do Sturridge’s remaining confidence any favours, but I think he’s the one to go. Hope no more injuries or they’ll be setting up M*A*S*H tents on the touchline.”48 mins: United have everyone in defence. Van Dijk plays the ball right to Matip, who plays the ball back to Van Dijk, who – with everyone in front of him covered by a red shirt – goes back to his goalkeeper.47 mins: Matip very nearly gives the ball away to Sánchez on the halfway line, but just about recovers.46 mins: Mané tries to backheel Salah into space in the United penalty area, but the ball is cut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

In the less brutal of these, I get off the train a few stops early on my way to work and walk along the canal listening to a podcast. It has become clear that this is the only way I can concentrate – when it’s just me, a goose and the good morning smell of marijuana. But it’s also made me realise that when I’m listening to something on headphones, I’m not entirely here.There are infinite reviews of books, music and podcasts, but rarely will someone review the experience of listening. A modern review might acknowledge, for example, that listening to this in motion during an autumnal shower you will feel like Buster Keaton as the front of a house falls down on him. The combination of emotions and dialect will propel the listener to work in a cloud of brick dust, leaving them standing shakily with a window frame around their feet wondering how they got there. Why do we not talk about this more? The dizzying effect of a stranger whispering into your ear?This week I’ve been listening to an audiobook, and the experience has grizzled and slapped me about. Reading a novel, one’s eyes remain focused on the black and white page, but listening to one allows a level of disassociated roaming, the effect of which for me has been a merging of truths. I will reach the steps by the bridge and be quickly struck with the memory of having broken up with my boyfriend at the top, before consciously recalibrating to pin this down in fact as simply the place I was yesterday when the characters broke up in my book. I have new memories of love blossoming at traffic lights, and abuse centred around the biscuit aisle of my local Sainsbury’s. It sounds like nothing, maybe, but for me it’s adding a disconcerting element of virtual reality to my morning commute. There is a danger to it.Of all the clues that I’m getting old, the sight of young people permanently plugged into their headphones is the most confusing. Everywhere, the chattering of mouths into phones that aren’t there, the animated discussion happening between a single person. Headphones the size of croissants, or wireless buds surely begging to fall into a busy road, all ears full, at all times, everywhere. These people appear to be living normal lives, buying fruit, reading messages, savouring the brief joys of a meal-deal’s dessert. And yet, all the time there is somebody singing or talking into their ears. All the time!Me, no. Me, when I am listening to a podcast, I am sitting there on the producer’s lap. I am sitting there on Jon Ronson’s knee as he gently asks a man about his wife’s death. I am propped up in bed with Dan Savage’s caller as she considers how to ask her boyfriend to treat her more like a baby. I am thinking bitter chauvinistic thoughts as I sit between a pair of women giggling about murder. In my This American Life phase I thought of my headphones as a tool for crying with, as inevitably I would arrive at my destination striped with mascara and need to do some breathing exercises quickly by the sinks. Is it like this for everyone? When I see somebody on the bus singing heartily along to their playlist I think it might be, but other times I worry it points to a simpleness in my brain. I drown in these things.Maybe it’s because I’m so used to doing three things at a time, damping down the constant ache to click away, that the experience of listening properly is so overwhelming. Maybe it’s the relaxing meditation of a voice almost whispering, or the pace of a podcast, uncommon to a digital age. Maybe it’s that these stories mean I can never be alone, or maybe it’s the uncommon intimacy of having a story read to me. I read a lot of stories out loud, including one last week to a class of children, with a boy who, at the end, asked, “Will the postman be OK?” The story had not featured a postman I said “yes” with feeling.Every evening a bedtime story will provide some rhyming resolution to the day just gone, and then the lights are turned off, and then goodnight. I am returning the favour to myself, with a brisk Irish accent telling me what the trees looked like that warm day in September, a dry American writer crowbarring open my ideas of what a relationship is for, an Australian investigator who will not let it lie.

Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV. Their colours distract me from the grey skies and dull brick walls in the window behind them. I’m reminded that winter is temporary, the warm will return, and it will be so intoxicating I’ll say nonsense like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by August again.To stay snug and cosy, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck – you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

They are likely to be issued by an insurance company for free, but the industry is warning it could take up to a month to obtain one, so if no deal happens and you’re booked to go away with the car this Easter, you will need to act fast.The official advice from the UK government is: “From 29 March 2019, in the event that there is no EU exit deal … drivers of UK-registered vehicles will need to carry a motor insurance green card when driving in the EU and EEA.”Note that a green card (and they do have to be on green paper) typically lasts only 90 days, and if your insurance renewal comes up while you’re abroad, you will need one for each cover period. The card applies to the vehicle, not the driver.Direct Line insurance says: “In the event of a no-deal Brexit, we have plans to ensure customers are provided with a green card if they drive in Europe on or after 29 March. Customers will need to contact us at least two weeks in advance of when they are due to travel.”In Ireland, where 30,000 drivers commute across the border daily, and where shoppers from Dublin frequently head to Belfast and vice versa, the green cards issued are likely to be valid for one year. Irish insurers have prepared 400,000 green card forms in the event of no deal, and some UK insurers are now proactively sending green cards to customers in Northern Ireland.Insurers say they are already incurring hefty costs to organise the cards and prepare their staff in call centres to handle an inevitable barrage of questions. The Association of British Insurers says it would much rather none of this was happening. “It remains the case that insurers do not want a no-deal Brexit it would be bad for the economy and bad for our customers,” it says. “We continue to hope these arrangements are never needed and urge the government, UK parliament and EU27 to agree an orderly way forward.”In a sentence You will have to buy an International Driving Permit to drive in Europe, at a price of £5.50, with different ones required for France and SpainIf there is no deal with the EU then recognition of UK driving licences in the EU ends. So British drivers will have to go to the Post Office and obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP), which you will need to carry with you in conjunction with your UK driving licence.There is a curious twist to the international rules which means that if, say, you drive through France and into Spain, you’ll need two different IDPs. That’s because the 1949 IDP convention covers Spain, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland, while the 1968 IDP convention covers all other EU countries, plus Norway and Switzerland.So at the Post Office you have to specify which permit you want, depending on which country you are visiting, or get both if driving between France and Spain or Portugal and Spain.And just to add a little more complexity, the permit you buy for Portugal will last three years, but in Spain you’ll have to renew it every year.The Post Office has set up a webpage dedicated to this process. But you can’t buy it online – you’ll have to head to a Post Office with your driving licence, passport and a passport-sized photograph.As regards driving back and forth between the UK and Ireland, there has been significant confusion.Last September the government’s official position was that an IDP would be required if driving across the Northern Ireland border. But in January this advice was withdrawn, and it now says: “If you hold a UK driving licence you should not need an IDP to drive in Ireland from 29 March as Ireland does not currently require IDPs to be held by driving licence holders from non-EU countries.”It was also revealed this week that British citizens resident in Ireland – estimated to number about 300,000 – will be required to swap their UK driving licence for an Irish one at a fee of €55 (£48) if there is no deal on Brexit. PCIn a sentence They will no longer be valid and buying travel insurance will become essentialFor years, Brits travelling, studying and working in Europe have relied on the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) that entitled the holder to state-provided medical treatment if they fell ill or had an accident in an EUEEA country.Two weeks ago, the UK government issued its latest advice on healthcare when travelling abroad, warning that if the UK leaves with no deal, our Ehics will no longer be valid.It has advised anyone travelling on or after 29 March to any of the EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, to buy travel insurance to cover healthcare “just as you would if visiting a non-EU country”.It has said it is seeking agreements with countries on healthcare arrangements for UK nationals after Brexit day, but no such agreements are in place yet. Those studying or working temporarily abroad already won’t be able to buy travel insurance as they have already left. They will probably just have to risk it as, alternatively, they face having to buy expensive local insurance, which will run into several hundred pounds.Ehic was never intended to cover long-term residents who had moved to another country, but many relied on it particularly if they spent only part of the year abroad, or for when they had just arrived in a new country. MBIn a sentence: Visa-free travel to Europe ends, paving the way for possible £52 90-day visasIt’s arguably the craziest prospect of all, but if the Brexit impasse is not broken, British tourists face having to apply for a visa to visit most of mainland Europe.That was the warning from Brussels this week where reports say there is a very real prospect of UK citizens having to apply for a €60 (£52) visa to enter the Schengen area, which includes most of the EU countries we generally visit.The problem concerns talks that have become mired in a dispute with Spain over whether the British overseas territory Gibraltar should be described as a “colony” in the EU’s statute book.If no solution can be found the UK will be left in legal limbo as it is not on the list of countries where a visa is required to visit the EU, nor on a list of countries with an exemption.It could mean UK citizens heading to Europe for Easter having to pay for a Schengen visa or be left waiting for a bilateral deal. In a tit-for-tat move, EU citizens coming to the UK would face a similar scheme. Further down the line, the EU is proposing an electronic visa waiver system valid for three years at €7.Questions also remain about how travellers will be treated when they arrive in Europe. Portugal is the only EU state so far that has said it will create a third lane at airport passport control to speed Brits through. Without a deal, they face having to queue with all non-EU passport holders, with the inevitable long delays. MBIn a sentence The government promises to keep EU flight delay payouts, but airlines could use changes to fight having to pay outEuropean Union flight compensation regulations have been fought in almost every UK court, so could a no-deal Brexit give the airlines another opportunity to stop paying passengers after a lengthy delay or cancellation?That’s the warning from lawyers this week – in spite of government promises that in the event of no deal, passenger flight rights will remain. The EU Withdrawal Act provides that EU regulations – as applied now – will convert into domestic law, meaning the same rules will continue to apply until legislators in the UK decide otherwise.On the face of it, passengers will still be able to claim to up to €600 (£536) in compensation when airline problems cause their flight to land more than three hours late, or is cancelled. They will also be entitled to meals and hotels if the delays are caused by problems beyond the airline’s control.However, with just over a month to go, specialist flight compensation lawyers say there has been no explanation as to how it will work. The compensation rules currently apply to all airlines based in the EU, and flights out of EU airports on non-EU-based carriers.The wording of the new legislation would have to watertight, says Coby Benson, solicitor at Bott and Co, because in the past the airlines have used any ambiguity to dismiss legitimate claims, and have fought them through the courts.“We anticipate that if the new adopted legislation is not entirely clear, the airlines will seize upon this to allow them to wriggle out of paying. This has been the history of this legislation from the start, and I can only foresee further court battles. If the airlines spot a get-out opportunity, they will try to use it to their advantage,” he says. MBIn a sentence The EU pet passport scheme ends for UK travellers and their cats and dogs – replaced with expensive tests every time they travelIf you were planning to take your dog or cat on holiday to Europe after a no-deal Brexit, you may want to think again after you have read this.The UK’s participation in the European Union pet passport scheme in effect ends on 29 March. It means that cat and dog owners (the documents also mention ferrets) will need to show that their animals are healthy – and produce new documents to support their animal’s health when they arrive in the EU.Pet owners will also have to show that their animal been effectively vaccinated against rabies by undergoing a rabies antibody titration test at least 30 days after inoculation, and no fewer than three months before they enter the European Union.Pets will need to travel with an animal health certificate issued by an officially registered vet. This certificate can only be issued up to 10 days prior to entry into an EU member state.This comes at a time when many veterinary practices are already experiencing worker shortages and recruitment problems, it says. The advice is to book well ahead if you’re planning to take your pet abroad. MBIn a sentence Phone companies say they have no plans to reintroduce charges – but don’t rule them out eitherArguably the EU’s most significant consumer benefit of recent years has been the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges. The EU first capped then finally scrapped roaming charges across mainland Europe in June 2017.It means EU citizens can use their mobile in another EU state as if they are at home. Call plans that typically include 500 free minutes and 2GB data can be used abroad without incurring extra charges, which, before the EU’s intervention, regularly cost more than the flight to your destination.But if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, has confirmed there will be nothing to stop mobile operators reimposing the charges.So hooked on smartphones have we all become, a return of roaming charges might be considered one of the worst impacts of leaving the EU.The biggest providers – Vodafone, O2 and EE – confirm they have no plans to reintroduce them on 1 April, but equally have not ruled out their reintroduction. Only Three has promised not to reinstate them irrespective of the Brexit outcome.Currently, EU mobile phone networks are not allowed to add extra charges to calls made by customers of other EU operators. That ends with a no deal.O2 says: “We will be working closely with the government and other European operators to try and protect the current arrangements, so our customers can continue to enjoy free EU roaming.”A future trade deal with the EU would include the abolition of, or limits to, mobile roaming charges, they have said. MBIn a sentence Retirees to Europe should worry about the future of their state pension, but private pension issues were largely resolved this weekThe 200,000 British citizens aged over 65 who have retired to the EU – half to Spain – still don’t know if their UK state pension will be uprated every year after we leave the EU, or whether they’ll join the “frozen’ pensioners” in Canada and Australia who have seen their pensions shrivel.The government has committed to uprate pensions across the EU in 2019 and 2020, but after that will only go ahead if there is a deal. It says: “We would wish to continue uprating pensions but would take decisions in light of whether, as we would hope and expect, reciprocal arrangements with the EU are in place.”If they are not uprated, it could leave retirees in poverty and force a return to the UK. Someone retiring to Australia 20 years ago still receives the basic weekly UK state pension rate of £66.75 prevailing at the time.But there’s better news on private pensions. For months the UK pension industry has been in limbo around whether they can look after a private pension taken out in the UK if the person has retired to the EU. But this week the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in Frankfurt said providers could continue to operate much as before, even with no deal.Steven Cameron of Aegon says: “There were concerns that UK providers might have been unable to service the policies of such iniduals. We very much hope EU regulators will confirm they are following EIOPA’s recommendations and will not treat these policies as ‘cross border’ which should allow servicing to continue.”Investments in funds, such as equity Isas, should be unaffected with a “temporary permissions regime” in place even if we crash out.In a sentence The EU-mandated £85,000 safety net will remain and the vast majority of UK account holders should be unaffectedThe immediate impact of no deal on UK bank account holders is likely to be minimal, but the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU is likely to rise and processing times become slower.Banks report that they have been receiving calls from worried Brits living in the EU who regularly access their UK-based bank account. Will a hard Brexit mean they can no longer use these accounts? The banks are assuring customers that they can continue to use them and transfer money overseas as they did before.Even if a bank appears to be from an EU country, there are few issues. For example, both Santander UK and Bank of Ireland (UK) are domiciled in the UK for regulatory purposes and post Brexit will be treated exactly the same as Lloyds or Barclays.However, there are those who are domiciled outside the UK and use EU membership to “passport” their services to the UK. But even here agreement has been reached, with a temporary permissions regime allowing them to carry on in the UK for three years after Brexit, and apply for authorisation during that time.The £85,000 protection for deposit accounts is partly the product of EU directives.But the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) says: “FSCS protection for UK-based customers of UK authorised firms will not change, regardless of whether the UK leaves with or without a deal.” PC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/673275cdac35f1f1725bea767b788704069e980d/0_13_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ee7f78fb2457770ba317e28e210ddb","title":"brexit could be delayed until 2021 eu sources reveal","story":"Donald Tusk is said to favour extending negotiating period if Commons continues to reject May’s dealBrexit could be delayed until 2021 under plans being explored by the EU’s most senior officials, at a time of growing exasperation over Theresa May’s handling of the talks, the  can reveal.A lengthy extension of the negotiating period is said by EU sources to be favoured by Donald Tusk, the European council president, should the Commons continue to reject May’s deal.Replacing the 21-month transition period with extra time as a member state would allow the UK and the EU to develop their plans for the future relationship with the aim of making the contentious Irish backstop redundant.The EU is determined to avoid offering a short extension only to have to revisit the issue in the summer when the government again fails to win round parliament.“If leaders see any purpose in extending, which is not a certainty given the situation in the UK, they will not do a rolling cliff-edge but go long to ensure a decent period to solve the outstanding issues or batten down the hatches,” one EU diplomat said.Informed sources say there is dismay that senior government figures are focused on seeking domestic political advantage and appear wilfully blind to the opposition to reopening the withdrawal agreement.One insider said there was concern that there was no domestic consensus over the withdrawal agreement but also over the UK’s position on what kind of trading relationship it wanted when the transition period elapsed.“Some say: ‘We can have Norway, we can have Canada, we can have a customs union, we can’t have a customs union. Some of them say we are not to be trusted because they think we are going to use the backstop to keep them in the EU forever, but if you look at the confusion, you can see precisely why the backstop is necessary,” said an insider.There is also disquiet that Ireland will be scapegoated for no deal when member states believe the country is being used as a proxy to tease out positions on future trade talks. For this reason “any attempt to blame the Irish for no deal will backfire,” said a source.There is also bewilderment that the recent flurry of meetings in Brussels involving May’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, are being characterised in London as “negotiations” when the reality is the EU is still waiting for the prime minister to show them the alternative arrangements for the Irish backstop for which she claims to have a majority in support.The frustration being felt in Brussels was evident after Cox arrived in Brussels with no concrete proposals. “We are still in wait-and-see mode. There is a feeling that Britain is overplaying how things are going,” said an insider.One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. “She gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can’t,” the diplomat said. “Unless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.”Concerns emerged as May flew in to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik for an EU-Arab league of states summit on Sunday, and confirmed she would not be putting a revised Brexit deal to the Commons this week. Even so she insisted that it “within our our grasp to leave the EU by 29 March and that is what we are planning to do”.May said she would instead put the deal to parliament on 12 March and brushed off the calls by three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – for a no-deal scenario to be ruled out.“What we see around the cabinet table are strong views on the issue of Europe”, she said. “What we are doing as a government is ensuring we are doing everything we can to leave the European Union with a deal.“People are talking about the extension of article 50 as if it solves the issue when of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point when we must make that decision.”There is growing support, however, among MPs for an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.As he arrived at the summit in Egypt, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, offered his support for a delay to Brexit given the impasse in the negotiations.“If by the beginning of March there’s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK”, Kurz told reporters.EU officials are understood to be looking at three options if such an extension request is received: a three-month “technical” extension to allow extra time for ratification if the parliamentary process develops positively, or a longer prolongation of nine to 21 months should there be no clear way to break the current impasse.A source close to the European council president said that as a request had yet to be made by Downing Street, the issue had not been discussed by leaders. “No Tusk position on this,” the official said of the mooted 21-month extension. “At this stage, at least.”But sources said the EU was determined to avoid a series of three-month extension requests by the UK, which would cause damaging uncertainty, leaving Brussels unable to plan for the future.The emergence of the idea of a 21-month delay to Brexit will be seen by some as an attempt to push Brexiter MPs into backing May’s deal.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barner, had advised ambassadors last week that the threat of a lengthy extension could be used by May as leverage in talks with her Brexiter MPs as she seeks to nudge the deal through parliament.May is meanwhile driving on with seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to reassure Brexiters of the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The prime minister updated Tusk during a 30-minute meeting at the summit in Egypt on her plans for the meaningful vote. “No tensions,” an EU source said. “Focus on practicalities.”Tusk was said to have told May that the EU would have “clarity that a proposal for the way forward can command a majority in the UK, before the issue is tackled by the European council”.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who will hold talks with May on Monday in Egypt, dismissed claims made earlier on Sunday by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop could still emerge from the talks.“A backstop that includes a time-limit is not a backstop at all. Nor would a unilateral exit clause work for us”, Varadkar said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b58534f877b033be820bba381d0245e8ac906a9/0_320_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46fc8c2172d0cc1f4f6ff68ddbfd2bfe","title":"theresa may brexit vote delay what does it all mean","story":"What will happen in the Commons this week now the ‘meaningful vote’ is delayed?What does Theresa May mean when she says MPs won’t get a ‘meaningful vote’ this week?When the government’s flagship Brexit bill, the Withdrawal Act, was passing through parliament, MPs wrung a promise from the government that they would be given the chance to approve Theresa May’s deal in what became known as a “meaningful vote”.They have had one chance to do that so far, on 16 January, when they rejected her painstakingly negotiated agreement by a thumping majority of 230.She has since been on a diplomatic charm offensive, holding meetings and phone calls with EU leaders and senior officials in a bid to convince them to make legally binding changes to the most contentious part of her deal, the Irish backstop.At the same time, ministers and officials have been talking to Labour MPs who might consider backing her deal, in exchange for concessions on issues including workers’ rights and environmental standards. As she said on her way to Sharm El Sheikh, however, she does not yet have a new deal to put to the House of Commons.So will MPs not now get the chance to vote on Brexit this week?They will get to vote, but not yet on a reworked Brexit deal.After her historic loss in January, May promised to renegotiate the deal and bring it back to parliament for MPs to approve in another meaningful vote.Under the terms of an amendment to the Withdrawal Act drawn up by Dominic Grieve, however, ministers also had to come back to the Commons within a set deadline, set out what they planned to do next and give MPs the chance to influence government policy by tabling and voting on amendments.There have been two such series of votes since January. In the first, on 28 January, two amendments were passed . One called for “alternative arrangements” to the Irish backstop and the other rejected a no-deal Brexit.When Theresa May came back to parliament again on Valentine’s Day and asked MPs to reaffirm those two amendments, she suffered an embarrassing defeat after a rebellion by the backbench European Research Group (ERG).That day, she promised to put another motion before MPs to be voted on this Wednesday if she had not managed to strike a fresh deal by then.So the government will table a motion this week, probably a fairly anodyne one, and MPs will get to table amendments on it and vote on them. The most likely crunch-point is a no-deal Brexit.Will May’s pledge of another meaningful vote by 12 March quell the rebellion in her cabinet?No. Deep isions in the cabinet over how to manage Brexit burst into the open this week, with three ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – saying in a statement published in the Daily Mail on Saturday that if a breakthrough could not be achieved “in the next few days” then the article 50 notice period for leaving the EU must be extended.May is now promising to bring her deal back to parliament for a second meaningful vote on 12 March, just 17 days before Britain is due to leave the EU.The comments by Rudd, Gauke and Clark suggested they were ready to join the string of ministers who have signalled that they are prepared to defy party whips in order to back the Cooper-Letwin amendment.Due to be tabled this week by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the former Tory minister Oliver Letwin, the amendment would force the government to make time available to pass a bill requesting an extension to article 50 if parliament has not agreed a deal by mid-March.MPs will vote on the amendment on Wednesday, and it now looks highly likely to pass.Will MPs get the chance to vote for a second Brexit referendum this week?Perhaps not. The Liberal Democrats have said they will table a “people’s vote” amendment, but the Speaker may not select it without wider cross-party support.Much of the action in seeking to secure a referendum currently centres around an amendment tabled by Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle calling on MPs to back May’s deal in exchange for a public referendum to ratify it.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Sunday there was a “high possibility” Labour might support a reworked version of the amendment – but it would not be tabled this week, only with the deal itself, when May brings it back for another meaningful vote on 12 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc16ed44bdc9cd819bbddff03eae7d48bdac50a5/1148_558_1373_824/master/1373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a18fc437d54cad46789cb8b0f6e5e0","title":"theresa may postpones meaningful vote on final brexit deal","story":"Prime minister promises to hold vote by 12 March in move that will deepen cabinet splitsMPs may have to wait until 12 March for a meaningful vote on the government’s final Brexit deal, Theresa May has said in an intervention that will deepen splits in her cabinet.The prime minister confirmed on Sunday that she would not hold the vote this week as she flew to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where she is due to discuss Brexit on the margins of an EU summit with Arab leaders.It is a critical week for May, with many in the House of Commons having been expecting to vote on her deal.Without a reworked withdrawal agreement to bring back to MPs, she has promised to table an amendable motion, which will allow backbenchers another chance to try to block a no-deal Brexit.May said: “My team will be back in Brussels on Tuesday. As a result of that, we won’t bring a meaningful vote to parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March. But it’s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March and that is what we are planning to do.”Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is among three cabinet ministers who have publicly threatened to defy the prime minister by backing an effort to force the government to extend article 50 if no deal is agreed by mid-March.Rudd published a public statement on Saturday with David Gauke, the justice secretary, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, warning about the risks of a no-deal Brexit.May has imposed a 12 March deadline for a vote because it should be held before the chancellor’s spring statement on 13 March, Downing Street sources said.May brushed off calls to change course. “What we see around the cabinet table are strong views on the issue of Europe. What we are doing as a government is ensuring we are doing everything we can to leave the Europe Union with a deal,” she said.“People are talking about the extension of article 50 as if it solves the issue when of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point when we must make that decision.”Asked what she would do if she lost the meaningful vote, she said: “Why is it that people are always trying to look for the next thing after the next thing after the next thing?“It is pointless, we should focus on what we are doing now, which is working to get a deal and bring that deal to a meaningful vote, which I want to see passed by the House of Commons and leave on 29 March.”Asked about the open defiance from the three cabinet ministers who have threatened to resign, she said: “I have recognised and others have recognised that there are strong views that are held on this issue. What we are collectively doing as a government and as a cabinet is working to get that deal.“Parliament wants to see changes to the backstop. We have been working with the EU on that. Our focus is on leaving with a deal. My intention is to work with a deal.”In a separate development, May pledged £200m to help victims of the war in Yemen as she arrived in Egypt. “We are playing our part and will continue to do so but there is still more that we as an international community can do,” she said.“At the summit in Egypt, I will call on our partners in Europe and the region to continue to provide the aid that is so desperately needed.”May is due to meet a Saudi delegation on Sunday and is expected to also raise the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Brexit will not be on the official agenda at the inaugural meeting of the EU-Arab League conference, but May is expected to hold meetings with the European council president, Donald Tusk, later on Sunday and Angela Merkel on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27acfd990386e0d0bcec1015720bd872eae4619f/0_251_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1a73b799ffa9c57f6956a616ef92f1","title":"dinosaur fossils collectors museums price sale","story":"Leading US palaeontologists are calling for a worldwide halt to the sale of vertebrate dinosaur fossils. The booming market for specimens, driven by their popularity with wealthy private collectors, including Hollywood stars, is pushing up prices and putting them out of reach of museums and scientists, they say.While the art market is organised around brand-name artists, dinosaur sales are all about celebrity species, with a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton fetching up to $10m, although the velociraptor is the most prized. The price tag for a triceratops’s skull is $170,000 to $400,000, and a diplodocus is $570,000 to $1.1m. Last year a complete egg of an aepyornis maximus, otherwise known as an elephant bird, sold for $130,000 – roughly five times what it would have gone for a decade earlier.Jerry Smith, an expert in the evolution of freshwater fishes in the department of zoology at Michigan University, told the Observer: “When specimens go into a private home or collection, our understanding, interpretation or discovery of new information they contain will never reach the scientific community.”Last year the US Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology (SVP) called on the Parisian auction house Aguttes to cancel a sale inside the Eiffel tower that contained just one lot: a 29-foot-long dinosaur of a yet-to-be identified species. The winning bidder paid $2.3m for the piece.Executive members of the society drew attention to the claim that the winning bidder could name the species, calling that assertion “misleading because the naming of new species is governed by the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature”.“The sale of all fossils is inappropriate,” says Catherine Badgley, former president of the SVP, which represents more than 2,200 international palaeontologists. “Many, particularly vertebrate fossils, are rarely common, and it’s certainly not the case for dinosaurs. The commodification is in principle inappropriate because it motivates unscrupulous people.”As ARTnews magazine pointed out last week, we can thank Steven Spielberg’s 1993 film Jurassic Park for the surging dinosaur market. The initial phase peaked in 1997, just months after the film’s sequel, The Lost World, was released, when a 12m-long T rex named Sue was sold at Sotheby’s for a record-breaking $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago.But the interest has hardly abated. The recent Art Basel Miami included a special project called DeXtinction, organised by two mining companies, Avant Mining and Interprospekt, that included a 120 million-year-old mother and juvenile allosaur and a well-preserved dinosaur egg set from the Cretaceous period, 75 million years ago.According to the New York Post’s Page Six column, the exhibit drew the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio, who along with Nicolas Cage and Russell Crowe, has staked out a reputation as a collector.And that’s what alarms palaeontologists who fear not only the loss of scholarship but also the diminution of appreciation for the work that goes into discovery, excavation and reconstruction of a dinosaur skeleton as they become fashionable objects of home decor.Dinosaur fossil collection comes with risks. In 2013, the 67 million-year-old skull of a tyrannosaurus bataar bought by Nicolas Cage became the focus of an investigation into smuggling. Cage had bought it at an auction in California, beating DiCaprio with a $276,000 bid. It was later discovered that the skull was obtained from Eric Prokopi, a self-described “commercial palaeontologist” who had previously pleaded guilty to illegally importing fossils from Mongolia and China.The looted skull was ultimately returned to Mongolia.All of which still serves to alarm working palaeontologists, who express concern that institutions are being priced out of the market and important specimens lost to private collections. Badgley points to specimens dug from the Green River Formation in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, which has some of the earliest bataar fossil specimens known. “Bat fossils overall are extremely rare, and even if half from this really early period are going into private collections, then that’s an enormous amount of really important information that’s being lost,” she says.Badgley’s message to collectors, then, is simple: collect by all means but steer clear of unique specimens.“There isn’t a strong link between expensive trophy specimens and an increase in the science of palaeontology. If anything, they’re seen more for their rarity and economic value than for their scientific information. It’s not necessary for people to become interested in palaeontology by having a unique specimen that’s theirs and theirs alone.”In her experience, she says, “people are often just as happy with something that’s very common”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc349f16005cc88d1fc986f6b2a5239a7d44eb0/0_246_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0487a6a0601b1754559284dcc203d1cd","title":"england wales womens six nations match report rugby union","story":"In the city where England’s men saw their grand slam hopes reduced to rubble, their women’s side continued to build an unstoppable momentum in their own bid for a Six Nations clean sweep. At a sun-drenched Cardiff Arms Park, England helped themselves to nine tries to overwhelm Wales.On the Arms Park’s plastic pitch England looked the real deal. Abbie Scott had been handed the captaincy and the Harlequins lock was at the heart of a dominant display by their pack. Wales lost this fixture 63-0 two years ago. They at least had the consolation of their first tries in three games against England but there was a huge gap between them and the newly professionalised visitors.It took barely 90 seconds before England’s pack worked the prop Sarah Bern over for the first try of the afternoon. The forwards and backs then sent Jess Breach over in the corner. The England pack rumbled forwards and Marlie Packer, who missed the victory over France, was driven over for a third try as the one-way traffic continued.Katy Daley-Mclean looked like she had set up Breach’s second try with a towering kick to the corner but the try was ruled out for a knock-on in the build-up – however it was only a minor reprieve. Bern made a searing break for the Welsh 22 and the tight-head added a sidestep that left the Wales full-back Elinor Snowsill grasping at thin air.Breach found room on the left-hand touchline after a burst through the middle by Rachael Burford. Breach, the former sevens player, has now scored an astonishing 16 tries in five 15-a-side internationals. England were attacking from all parts of the field but Wales at last got on the scoreboard when they cleverly worked the wing Jess Kavanagh over just before the break.The score galvanised Wales. After the break they pinned England into their own half to test the defensive qualities of the Red Roses. But England rallied with a counterattack and Bern was denied a hat-trick when it was ruled that there had been a knock-on before she grounded the ball.Cath O’Donnell scored a sixth try after another rolling maul and another consultation with TMO. The wing Abby Dow then found space to beat some weak Welsh tackling after a smart break by Daley-Mclean and Sarah Beckett took advantage of a disintegrating defence to score under the posts. Wales had another minor victory when the replacement prop Cerys Hale worked her way over for a try after a 26-phase move but England had the last word when Daley-Mclean scored with the final move of the match. Scott had warned that Wales were a “different beast” at home but there was only one side breathing fire on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4827d0545971c79bf0d9d38943a2d09986914d1f/0_112_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55216c081348158ac65fbde94ae36842","title":"italy ireland six nations match report","story":"Ireland tiptoed out of Rome with an unconvincing victory, claiming the four-try bonus point but enduring a serious scare from Italy. Quinn Roux, Jacob Stockdale, Keith Earls and Conor Murray crossed the line for an Ireland side again struggling for fluency.Edoardo Padovani and Luca Morisi scored tries for Italy to lead 16-12 at half-time, but Ireland edged home to leave the Azzurri still without a Six Nations win under Conor O’Shea’s stewardship.Ireland’s struggles were underlined by Johnny Sexton muttering angrily to himself and kicking out in frustration when he was replaced late on for Jack Carty to make his Test debut. Bundee Aki sustained a head injury and Sexton played through a minor leg problem that led to Murray taking over goal-kicking duties.Joe Schmidt, the head coach, wanted Ireland – and chiefly the half-backs Murray and Sexton – to rediscover the rhythm which underscored their stellar 2018. That quality continues to elude Ireland and their playmakers, but Schmidt’s side must at least be credited for emerging unscathed from a tricky situation.The captain, Peter O’Mahony, said beforehand that Ireland’s 22-15 defeat against Italy in Rome during 2013 still sends shivers down his spine. The Munster flanker led his men to avoid any further such trauma at the Stadio Olimpico, but this was another performance littered with indiscipline and inaccuracy.Roux and Stockdale handed the visitors the perfect start with two tries in the first quarter, but Ireland had already wasted several scoring platforms by then. The Connacht lock Roux capped a 19-phase move by ploughing in for their first try, with Stockdale then exploiting a cheap knock-on to canter home almost unimpeded.Both Italy tries came from Ireland errors, first they overthrew a lineout in their own 22 and the home side pounced, Tommaso Allan firing a ball over the top for Padovani to nip home. Then Tito Tebaldi pinched the ball at the base of an Ireland ruck to spark a field-length counterattack which ended in Morisi powering over.Ireland’s half-time problems could even have been worse had the full-back Rob Kearney been punished for what appeared a deliberate block on Tebaldi.The marauding Italy scrum-half chased his chip deep in Ireland territory when Kearney stepped into his path and sent him tumbling. The referee, Glen Jackson, ignored the incident entirely though, in a clear let-off for Schmidt’s side.Ireland improved after the interval, though not nearly enough to touch anything like the heights of a 2018 that included the grand slam and the November win against New Zealand.Earls stepped his way over the line to wrestle back Ireland’s lead, before Murray’s sniping finish secured the try bonus point. The Munster player so nearly claimed the score of the match, only to be dragged down metres short. Italy fell for the latest Schmidt special move, with this one seeing Sexton run a wraparound decoy line allowing Earls to blast through midfield. Hauled down just shy of the line though, his pass fell astray and the move broke down.Job done for Ireland in the end, but precious little else, leaving Schmidt’s side needing to step up several levels to face France and the grand slam-chasing Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81180c06fddce7c0c295eaf007f41f8a7b6a48b0/222_124_2211_1326/master/2211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e9dcfa21595bcbfefba87ce9b5785fd","title":"wales england talking points six nations","story":"Two years ago England used their bench in the final quarter to come from behind to defeat France and Wales, but the half-backs Dan Robson and George Ford never left it on Saturday. Dan Biggar was the replacement who turned into a game finisher and it raised a question about Eddie Jones’s scrum-half policy. He has preferred to have two in a squad rather than three to maximise their time on the training field, but having dropped Danny Care, the finisher supreme, after three years, and replaced him with the internationally inexperienced Dan Robson, England’s head coach has become reliant on a starter.• Robert Kitson: Wales’s comeback is one of Gatland’s finest hoursWales said before the match that while they felt Kyle Sinckler struggled to contain his emotions in the heat of the battle, they had no intention of lighting his fuse. Not until the first scrum when there were more views exchanged than in a Question Time Brexit debate. Wales kept pushing but as long as England were in control, which they largely were in the first half, the prop responded through his tackling, carrying and scrummaging. As Wales took the initiative after the break so his stitching started to unravel and was replaced after conceding two penalties. He will know better next time in Cardiff and remains a significant asset.• Wales 21-13 England: Six Nations player ratings from CardiffEddie Jones said that Wales are the ones smiling for now. The grand slam has gone but the championship remains open with England having the smoother run-in, Italy and Scotland at home, while Wales have to go to Murrayfield before welcoming the champions, Ireland. It is the fourth time Wales have won their opening three games and on the other occasions they have secured the grand slam. Lacking try bonus points, it looks their route to the top again in Warren Gatland’s 12th and final year.• Wales 21-13 England: match reportWales were confident of winning. Like England, they had won their opening two games, but the plaudits had all gone to the men in white. Wales forensically examined the tactics of a side that not long ago were on a losing run and concluded that if their power and kicking was dealt with, their narrow defence could be exploited as time wore on. It meant staying in the battle and, as they showed in Paris, they are comfortable playing catch-up, trusting in their fitness while they struggled in the lineout, they finished the physically stronger and in Liam Williams had a full-back who dominated the air. Wales turned England’s tactics back on them, powering their way to their first try and taking to the air for the second.• Jones will not rule out title as Gatland chases grand slamA turning point was the final minute of the first half when England turned an attacking lineout into a driving maul. Wales held firm and then defended the cross-kick to the right corner. England had seized those moments against Ireland and France and had they scored on Saturday, they would have been 15-3 up with a conversion to come, meaning Wales would have to do more than chip away at their lead after the break. There was no response from England when what had worked no longer did, tactically rigid as Ireland were against them. They missed Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, but their absence did not explain the inability to tweak the gameplan. In their past two matches against England, Wales have conceded five penalties, and their opponents’ loss of control under pressure in the second half was telling.• Andy Bull: Jones’s words about Wales prove to be a warningTwitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4250e82e7c76344784749ea3a8559e65ab33c0/0_207_3561_2137/master/3561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20972ba244d90e0c42071f94c6de8f67","title":"italy v ireland six nations live","story":"Ireland successfully grind out a win in Rome after being behind at half-time against ItalyHere is the match report from Rome: A nice moment for Jack Cart who made his Ireland debut today. It might not have been a classic performance from the team but it will be a day he never forgets. Schmidt says Murray took over the kicking duties from Sexton as the latter was “getting a kicking out there”.O’Shea says Italy gifted Stockdale a try but showed heart and desire. Adding that this performance will show that Italy will not roll over. It’s France next up for Ireland and you have to assume Schmidt will need to change a few things to ensure it’s a competitive game, as they will need to improve from today’s offering. Stockdale says his try was very lucky but he showed great anticipation to take control of the ball after a couple of Italians missed the kick-off. Brian O’Driscoll points out that this was a pretty average performance from Ireland and that they need to go back to basics.O’Mahony: “We know how difficult it is when we come here. Conor is doing a great job and Italy are a great rugby team.”He adds that it was great to secure their second away win of the competition. Ireland may have won but they certainly have a lot of work to do after that showing. They made a few changes but to look that rusty in a World Cup year must be very worrying for the coaching staff.Almost an exciting end there when Stockdale collected the missed McKinley penalty, ran down half the length of the pitch before seeing his offload dropped by Earls and the referee blowing for full-time.It was a great performance from Italy but they just fell short in the end, as Ireland showed a little extra quality and a touch more cunning to get through this tough encounter in Rome. 80+2 min: Italy get a couple of penalties as they look to get a losing bonus point. 78 min: Ireland are keeping hold of the ball here as they look to break down Italy and also let the clock tick down. 76 min: McKinley comes on for Italy. The Irishman, who is blind in his left eye, will really enjoy this moment, I am sure. 74 min: Italy are showing there is still life in them with some great work on the right wing. A couple of forwards then try to power through down the middle. Ruzza looks to get to the line but loses it at the crucial moment when hit by Kearney. 72 min: Allan puts a great kick into the corner to earn a lineout following a penalty being rewarded for a high tackle on Campagnaro. Sadly for the hosts, the knocked it on to give the ball back to Ireland. 69 min: Ireland now have the bonus point after that latest try and it really should be game over. Italy’s defensive frailties have been shown up again here.An Ireland maul ends in a try for Murray. O’Mahony takes the lineout and is then joined by a number of his teammates, who power the ball towards the line, ending with Murray stretching to get the ball down. The scrum-half himself then gets the kick, too.65 min: It’s Italy’s turn to start a quick move after being given a free-kick followed a failed scrum. Sexton strips the ball to win it back and then gets a penalty, allowing him to kick for touch 15 metres from the whitewash. 63 min: Earls strides through the line at pace after some quick passes off the back of a lineout but Italy just about chase him down just when it looks like he’s in the clear. Earls however keeps his wits about him and offloads to Stockdale, who can’t keep hold of it. 61 min: Ireland try to get themselves going with a quick throw-in. Farrell leads the change but only makes it to the edge of his own 22. A late tackle on Sexton results in a penalty for Ireland. Italy need to avoid giving away such silly penalties to stay in this. 59 min: Paul emails in: “If Ireland don’t put this game away swiftly and show their mettle to beat the minnows and the real titans in all phases of the game, RWC 2019 is going to be another missed opportunity for Earls, Sefton and co.”This certainly is a time to show what they can do against a weaker team. 57 min: Italy skew the scrum to the left, which sees a penalty given against them. Ireland move quickly down the pitch and enjoy some quick hands but Italy just about manage to block the spaces in their defence.55 min: Padovani does extremely well to hold onto a pass around his ankles and then lifts his head up to see a gap. Sadly the move comes to an end after Zanni is penalised for a knock-on despite the fact it looked to have hit his knee. 53 min: Ireland drive the ball over the halfway line but struggle to make any more progress as Italy push them back to show they are very much still in a game. After a long process of trying to power their way over Earls takes a couple of steps to the right and goes through a tiny gap he earned for himself. Murray coverts to give Ireland a three-point lead. 50 min: Ireland move it quickly inside the Italy 22 but just can’t find the desired gap. They eventually come back for a penalty under posts but decide to tap thinking a try is coming. It is a similar theme as Ireland try to force their way through but Italy hold them up well as Ireland throw everything at them.48 min: Another penalty goes the way of Ireland after the referee calls an offside. Ireland kick for touch, allowing incoming hooker Scannell, who replaces Cronin, a chance to show what he can do. His first throw finds its destination, which is a positive.46 min: Italy give away penalty after O’Mahony stops the release with the ball on the floor. It was a dangerous situation at the time but they were unable to make the most of it. 44 min: Ireland have started terribly here. An up and under is dropped by Kearney. This is utterly useless from Ireland, if they do not improve they are set for a shock defeat. Someone on the pitch needs to get them going. 42 min: Sexton’s kick-off did not go 10 metres, which is a pretty underwhelming way to start a half. Let’s hope things improve. Here we go again!!!It will be interesting to see how Italy deal with being ahead. They are certainly better attacking than defending, so will need to keep that positive attitude rather than considering holding on.The first Italy try was pretty decent move ...Italy are making me looking rather silly here, but not as silly as Ireland are looking. The visitors looked dangerous early but apart from the Stockdale try the invention levels have been rock bottom. They need to be quicker with it and find the holes which are there, as Italy look flawed defensively. Italy on the other hand are the superior attacking team with Tebadli, Padovani and Hayward all looking like breaking the lines.Italy are looking the better team in attack her and rightly go into the break leading, but Ireland have been pretty lacklustre throughout the opening period. Cronin gets the lineout right, allowing Ireland to get a maul going. They earn some good territory but Italy win it back and kick clear. Padovani is chief chaser of Tebaldi’s kick and it ends up in the corner, before it swung out to the other side where Morisi collects after Tuivaiti is tackled, before powering over the line. There could be a shock on here ...36 min: Italy looking good going forward here but they really need to work on their defence as Ireland will take advantage of the problems the hosts have there. Hayward shows some quick feet to defeat the Ireland defence after the visitors lost a lineout, but they just about hold him up in the end, but that is not the end of the danger as the ball is chucked out to the opposite wing by Allan to Padovani who runs it in. Allan can’t convert from the wing, sadly.

However, while it takes the company in a different direction, it dwells, still, on death and loss.Creator Alan Lucien Øyen is a Norwegian choreographer and playwright who uses text, dance and music to cinematic effect in a piece that’s meticulously crafted and confidently realised. There’s much talking, but it’s not a play – rather, a collection of shifting memories, expanded, refracted, and perhaps embroidered into a script that came out of long conversations with the cast in which the spectre of death hangs heavily.There’s a bit-part for love, but it’s mainly loss. Of brothers and fathers, in murders and especially suicides, in scenes tragic, surreal, funny or matter-of-fact: a funeral director who is far too frank about his business Julie Shanahan marvelling at the colossal size of a tear on a cinema screen compared with her own “tiny, insignificant” ones. The dancing offers texture and breathing space when there’s nothing left to say, mostly in solos that make wonderful use of the performers, whether the light, molten whoosh of Jonathan Fredrickson’s long limbs or dancers Aida Vainieri and Héléna Pikon, who have mastered the depth that lies in doing very little.What Øyen has taken wholesale from Bausch is her attitude to running times. At three and a half hours, it’s on the trying side, especially in a work without narrative propulsion that repeats and resets like an Escher staircase. Time has stopped on stage (the clock’s hands frozen), just as time stops in grief – what the poet Denise Riley calls “time lived without its flow” – that stasis and limbo underlined by a succession of mournful musical refrains, each one sounding like the bittersweet coda of a film: ending after ending, death after death.Bon Voyage, Bob … has itself a very poignant ending. I won’t describe it, but it feels as if for all that this piece takes Tanztheater Wuppertal on a fruitful new path, it has really been about Pina all along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d0aa1a92777b34fc26caa07c07aa6e682beb76/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f714a2abfec8e23d1d5cb99c2eba4bda","title":"swiss time travel aboard glacier express st moritz switzerland","story":"From glitzy St Moritz to a socialist watch-makers’ town onboard the Glacier ExpressIt’s like taking a starving man to the best restaurant ever and not letting them eat,” says Louis, shoulders hunched, scowling at the mint-white mountain peaks. Outside St Moritz train station, lights twinkle, snow begins to fall and everywhere is soft, crystalline white. It looks magical, yet it’s torture for one of us. I should have known that taking a ski addict to Switzerland for a no-ski break would be problematic, especially if the ski addict in question happens to be my temperamental teenage son.“You knew the deal before we came. It’s hardly a deprivation,” I say, watching liveried chauffeurs holding tiny gold placards bearing names: Madame Petrov, Monsieur Felipe. Daimlers purr, waiting to whisk guests to opulent hotels further up the mountainIt wasn’t my intention to drop in on the Alpine playground of the super rich. I wanted to head straight for La Chaux-de-Fonds, the city designed by watch-makers and much admired by Karl Marx, via one of Europe’s most scenic rail trips, the Glacier Express. But in the spirit of balance and contrast, first we stay at one of St Moritz’s oldest hotels, the Kulm. In its fin-de-siecle foyer, chandeliers sparkle, log fires blaze and It girls drip in Fendi fur. It is like walking into the back pages of Hola!“We have a six-course tasting menu booked for you in the grand restaurant for 7pm,” says the lady at reception. My son Louis is perkier by the minute. Strangely his mood darkens when we are shown our room, complete with wrap around views of the Alps.“I can’t believe it,” he fumes, pacing the marbled bathroom. “People have been living like this all along and I never knew. Now I can’t enjoy anywhere else.”“And that’s the problem with coming to places like this,” I say. “You feel either moral outrage or envy. Neither makes you happy. It’s better just not to know.” But Louis isn’t listening. He is distracted by the in-house video on the TV. “Mum, look, you can hire a mountain for a day. It’s only £4,000. Can we come back?”At supper, the waiter hovers while Louis eyes up the wine menu where bottles start at around £75. “I know it’s not a question you hear very often,” I say. “But what’s your cheapest glass of house red?” “House?” the waiter repeats, baffled. The next morning, we head for the ice-skating rink, owned by the Kulm but open to the public. My instructor is charming and patient, holding my hands while I grit my teeth and try to forget about the last time I went ice skating 20 years ago and broke my ankle. She offers to take Louis nighttime skiing – a Friday tradition where for less than £20 you can enjoy Switzerland’s longest floodlit slope till 1am. He’s thrilled to get the chance to ski while I enjoy the outdoor infinity pool in peace. Later in reception, I hear an over-confident English accent: “My son is still on the slopes. I’m afraid we’ll be a little late for the country club.” I’m horrified to realise it is me. Time to go, before I start enquiring about mountain rentals.Early next morning, we board the Glacier Express, the world’s slowest express train that has been running between St Moritz and Zermatt since 1930. It snows heavily the day we travel and much of the time we emerge from the darkness of each tunnel (there are 91 of them) into blinding white fog. But when it does clear, the scenery is spectacular. We enjoy a three-course lunch at our table as the train carves its way through the Oberalp Pass (2,033 metres above sea level) with its glaciers and peaks, then on through the Nikolai Valley, the deepest in Switzerland, arriving at Zermatt eight hours later. The next morning we board a train to La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Jura mountains, and close to the French border.If there is anywhere in Europe, let alone Switzerland, that is less like St Moritz in spirit, it’s hard to think of it. While St Moritz’s raison d’être is leisure for the super rich, La Chaux-de-Fonds is its polar opposite, created as a socialist antidote to all that glitz and privilege. Home of modern watch-making, the town prized industry and enterprise above all else. In 1794 a fire destroyed most of the buildings and, inspired by the radicalism of the French revolution, it was redesigned by the workers for the workers. Equality was built into the new city brick by brick. They chose not to have a civic centre given over to grand squares and palaces where the elite could parade their wealth and the poor would feel excluded.The city is built in a series of grids, its layout like a chess board streets were designed so workers and managers lived in close proximity, next to their workshops, with no neighbourhoods for the rich and ghettos for the poor. The boulevards are wide, allowing light to pour into the workshops so the watch-makers could work more efficiently. As a social experiment it was a resounding success Marx described the town as “la grande manufacture” in Das Kapital. The craft of watch-making thrived and prospered well into the 20th century, surviving the quartz revolution of the 1970s – even today La Chaux-de-Fonds is home to the workshops or headquarters of Rolex, Patek Philippe, Zenith, Tissot and Omega, many of which were founded here.The city is also home to the granddaddy of modernism, Le Corbusier, born here in 1887. In a snowy suburb overlooking the town, La Maison Blanche is a modernist gem built in 1912, and all the values that inspired the town are here in his design. Open-plan spaces for work as well as living, floor-to-ceiling windows so each room is flooded with light and, above all, the idea that everyone should be able to enjoy where they live. That night we stay at Grand Hôtel Les Endroits, a hotel on the edge of town where we we have our best meal so far, the food more French than Swiss, with shaved truffles baked with potatoes and cream, followed by chocolate patisserie.Our final morning is spent at a watch tutorial where, with the help of watch-maker Sebastian, a powerful microscope and some tweezers, we try to attach both watch hands to its face. After an hour of intense concentration, we manage to assemble a watch that keeps time. “Satisfying work isn’t it?” says Sebastian, as Louis tries it on his wrist. “I guess,” he says, studying it. “So how much would it cost to take it home?” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He doesn’t get out of bed until his mum shouts him into action over Skype. He turns up to work barefoot and in pyjamas. He foments staff dissent by opening payslips and blabbing about who gets paid what. He sets off the fire alarm, causing mass panic. Best of all, when he goes to an ideas meeting, he is asked to suggest how working practices could be improved. How about, he offers, all of you get some self-respect?To be fair, those to whom Tim is appalling deserve it. He has been hired by a greeting card manufacturer called Anarchy Hamster. The boss, Sean, who intolerably styles himself “chief lunatic”, has created a work environment of teeth-clenching, compulsory fun. Anarchy Hamster is a company devoted to flooding the world with fatuousness. So, when Tim discloses he may or may not defecate in his boss’s desk drawer, we may well think Sean has it coming. (If Tim has, which he hasn’t.)The conceit of Jerk (BBC Three) is that Renkow’s cerebral palsy means he can get away with saying what others dare not. He is Larry David with a twist – nobody risks confronting him because he is disabled. He is cerebral palsy’s James Bond: he has licence, if not to kill, then to wound by being awful to all-comers. He is to political correctness what Boris Johnson is to statesmanship. He is a sociopathic American who parlays his palsy into guilt-tripping PC Britons – which, as you know, is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.There’s another reason I like Renkow. His on-screen mother is Lorraine Bracco, who has moved from one toxic relationship as Tony Soprano’s shrink to another as mother to the most unpleasant American living in Britain (a hotly contested title). We see Bracco only on Renkow’s laptop, exhorting her son to get on with his life in the hoarsely captivating voice that still reduces me to jelly even when she is speaking such unsexy words as: “I can tell you as the world’s leading authority on cerebral palsy, that being a pussy is not a symptom.” And yet, despite this sensible advice, Tim remains a pussy and a jerk: he is never going to get a worthwhile job, a date or a visa with those twin attributes.Part of the pleasure of the opening episode is watching Renkow do everything he can to get fired, knowing that his bosses will do all they can to keep him on the payroll. “I think I’m on some sort of quota scheme, so they don’t have to hire a transsexual,” he muses sourly.In this, Renkow is akin to George Costanza in the Seinfeld episode in which he feigned disability to get preferential treatment (including the keys to the executive washroom), knowingly exploiting bosses’ awkwardness about disability. But, while Costanza was a phoney asshole working a guilt-ridden system to his advantage, Renkow is no phoney, but all asshole. When Sean asks Tim if he has any special needs, he demands a chair made of salmon leather, new shoes and a bigger desk. Bigger than hers, he says, pointing at Anne who sits opposite.Of course, it is wrong of him to mutate into Nigel Farage with nice but invertebrate Anne. When she breastfeeds her baby in the office, he sarcastically complains: “I didn’t think you could eat lunch at your desk.” Less wrong of him to suggest a new line for her greeting card. “Hello baby! Bye-bye wallet,” she suggests. “Bye-bye perineum,” he counters.How can disability be funny? Jerk suggests one way, not by making us laughing at disability (that, as you know, is wrong), but by exploiting the comic potential of a situation in which a jerk uses their disability to yank someone’s chain. Renkow gets his kicks from making others feel bad about his disability. Typical is the opening gag in which a man comes out of a cafe’s disabled toilet to be confronted by Renkow, who has thrown a glass of water over his crotch and gives his adversary a how-could-you? stare.The first episode is mostly a delight, although Renkow could have made more of the scene in which he struggles to get his walking frame into the office through the only entrance, a set of rotating doors. Also delightful are the two sidekicks Renkow and his co-writers Shaun Pye and Stu Richards have created. Idris is a geek who tries and largely fails to be Tim’s employment consultant (there is literally nobody on British TV less like Idris Elba than him), and my other new hero is Ruth, Tom’s epically careless care-worker. Ruth is a bigger jerk than the eponymous jerk himself, getting one client (Renkow) to make her sandwiches while she chillaxes, deferring her visit to another, incontinent, client. “You’re so emotionally retarded,” he tells Ruth. “Tim,” she replies tartly. “You know we don’t use that word.” “Sorry. You’re not emotional.” “Thank you,” she replies. Just possibly, the jerk has met his match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cd6f170fd3ccb02bf3fdb61ec4c595fe453e46/0_544_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45832ba556c241c3939b6970335325fe","title":"sara cox im at the top of a mountain im like dont dick it up","story":"Sara Cox was the party poster girl of the 90s who charmed millions with her Radio 1 show. After a few rocky years, she’s now at Radio 2 and has written a memoir about her rural childhoodShortly after I meet Sara Cox she wriggles under a sofa where her two dogs are trying to eat something they shouldn’t, but carries on talking in a muffled voice, apparently perfectly happy to continue the interview from the jaws of a slobbering animal. Given that we’re in a London photo studio, I could be slightly surprised by a TV and radio presenter who’s just had her hair and makeup done writhing on the floor, but as I’ve read her new memoir, Till the Cows Come Home, I’m not. And since I’ve also been listening to her brand new drivetime show on Radio 2, where she regales listeners with stories such as the time she accidentally took her daughter’s swimming costume to the pool – it turned out to be age 10, not size 10 – but stuffed herself into it to save a wasted journey, this seems perfectly normal. “I don’t know if you’ve seen a pork loin with string around it in the supermarket? I’ll just leave that thought there,” as she said on air.If you’re a woman who came of age in 1990s Britain, watching Sara Cox and her best friend Zoe Ball take over the media, presenting radio and TV shows with witty, breathless, irreverent chat, it is immensely difficult not to love her. We were gripped, watching the pair of them adventure their way on to the front page of the tabloids with a drink in one hand and a male conquest in the other – it was a whole new way of being female in public life. And while Ball was from a TV family, Coxy was straight out of working-class Bolton, having only got into media after being scouted for a bit of teenage modelling, which then led to co-hosting The Girlie Show when they found out she could talk.Yet her memoir is not a tell-all of those Met Bar years, when the stars of 1990s London all seemed to squeeze into one small drinking hole on Park Lane, but in fact the story of the previous 20, when she grew up the youngest of five children on a 40-acre tenanted farm in Lancashire. The book is like a big warm hug, full of local characters and misadventures, as well as hard graft and slaughter, with her parents working in haulage, cleaning and pubs, as well as on the farm. It’s also almost a work of social history, despite its author being only in her 40s. I mean, perhaps there are still children who dress in chiffon costumes on Bolton carnival floats while the mams swig vodka from ornamental teacups and the confused float driver accidentally hurtles them all off down a dual carriageway, and perhaps there are still English children who herd escaped cattle while dressed in a nightie and wellies, or swap eggs for shotguns, or are allowed to walk their own dog home when it breaks into the school again, all without a mobile phone in sight. But I doubt it.Coxy has written this partly as a love letter to her parents and grandparents, and so her three well-spoken children, with their very different London lives, will know where they come from. Her eldest, 14-year-old Lola, is a big reader who “just thinks it’s so mega that there’s a book with my name on it. But my biggest fear,” she says, “is that people are going to go, what makes Sara Cox think that she can write a book? Who does she think she is?”Given that she has a clear way with words and used to lie in her bunk bed reading Shakespeare aloud with her sister, I don’t think it’s her lyricism that’s in doubt. (In the book she describes a teenage outfit of hers “like Bet Lynch after she’d been run over by a council gritter”.) But the book’s publication has only happened to coincide with her big new job on Radio 2 – it was planned long before, when she wasn’t sure what was going on in her career. In fact, when her third child, Renee, was a baby, seven years ago, Coxy says she felt “like the squirrel with the nut at the start of Ice Age, trying to cling on to the ledge of my career. I feel like I’ve got to the top of a mountain now, like I’ve conquered it. But I’ve been working towards this for so long I’m like, crikey, God, I’ve got it! Don’t dick it up!”During the wilderness years, she would sometimes get in a London black cab and the driver would say, “Oi, Coxy, you still on the radio?” and she’d steel herself to reply, “Yes, every Saturday night at 10pm.” She got very good at body combat workouts – “Obviously I had a lot of anger.” (She favours pilates and cycling into work nowadays.) It was Davina McCall who rescued her, even though they weren’t close then, because Davina is apparently the last person in England who can actually use a phone.“The thing with Davina is, right, if you text her, she’ll fucking ring you. Which is really scary, because sometimes you just want to be lazy and chicken and say, “I’m feeling really shit about myself,” and you want just a nice text and some emojis back. But I think because of what she’s been through, Davina will make you confront how you’re feeling, and so you’re staring at her number coming up – and I call her Dave on my phone so it says DAVE RINGING – and you’re like, oh God…”Davina put Coxy on to a life coach called Michael Heppell. He made her work on an exercise where you imagine segments of a beach ball as the fundamental aspects of your life. She told him about her husband, Ben Cyzer, who works in digital advertising. “All my happiness and support with the kids and Ben was all fully inflated,” she says. (She was married before, to the DJ Jon Carter, with whom she had her first child, “and everybody who’s been through one marriage knows that, when it works a second time, you’re just so grateful. Ben is amazing and hilarious and he’s my other half, he’s my second chance.”) But the rest of her beach ball “was like somebody had taken a steak knife to it. And then I realised that, as much as I’m ambitious and a career woman, I’d happily take that, my personal side being fully inflated, rather than being really unhappy at home but a billionaire at work.”I wonder if her fear has its roots in the bullying she suffered at school, where two girls humiliated and hurt her on a daily basis. She writes that she’d like to travel back in time “to tell the 12-year-old me to retaliate. To push back. I was a strong girl from lugging buckets of water and bales of hay and probably could’ve battered them. But I didn’t.” (Of course, this being her, never more than two seconds from a joke, she then adds: “While I was at it, I’d also tell myself to maybe rethink the spiral perms.”)Yet, in a delicious twist of fate, the chief bully decided to text into the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show years later, when Coxy was the presenter, asking for a “shout-out”. “She got her shout-out all right,” she writes, in a rare flash-forward to the noughties, “though not the one she was expecting”. She tells me that she wouldn’t do it now. “I’d be much more grown up. But it was still much more raw then. I remember feeling myself just grow in stature and power, that very second – it was like in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid. I can’t remember what I said, but I was horrible.”That boldness would continue, with Sara Cox always taking things a little further than other BBC presenters. She got an official reprimand for wishing the Queen Mother a happy 100th birthday with, “Ah, she smells of wee, but we all love her.” (“I can’t talk about that, Sophie, please don’t,” she says, swallowing a guilty laugh. “They might have forgotten about it.”) I tell her I remember her playing Murder on the Dancefloor by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and then idly asking listeners to phone in with how they would murder that singer on the dancefloor. She is comically appalled, says it didn’t happen, then admits it probably did.“I mean, I remember very little,” she says. In fact, this is why she didn’t write the Met Bar memoir – she says she has forgotten most of it, and that what remains would involve “a lot of back and forth with lawyers, and a lot of people hating me. I think my peak 90s moment was posing on a Harley-Davidson outside the Met Bar with Wyclef Jean. There was a lot of Donna Air and the Appleton sisters and hanging out in Essex with the Prodigy and stuff. And Zoe, of course. But I’ve got no interest in writing that at all and I don’t think anyone would want to read it apart from you.”I am so far in disagreement I’m on the verge of offering to write it myself. Tell us what the Met Bar was like, at least.“Really small, with a dancefloor about the size of a Jacob’s cream cracker. I did dance in there, but it was more about talking loudly over each other and wanging on and general misbehaviour. Maybe you’d get Kate Moss occasionally. And it was part of the politan Hotel so you’d also get a few confused businessmen from Stuttgart over for a conference, who were probably thinking: ‘What the fuck are these 20-odd year olds doing running around and screeching?’ But it’s kind of to be celebrated. No bugger bothers to invite me to anything nowadays, because I’m like: ‘Will it be done by eight? Is it seated?’”And thus she has found her perfect home at Radio 2, the new headquarters of people who used to be cool but now enjoy a comfortable chair. Since January, Zoe Ball has presented the breakfast show and Sara Cox the drivetime one from 5-7pm (Steve Wright and Jo Whiley are also on the daily schedule – it’s like the whole of Radio 1 shifted across.) “We’ve totally Benjamin Buttoned the entire nation and sent them back to their teens,” she says happily. (If there was a Nobel Prize for the rapid deployment of pop culture allegories, Coxy would be its laureate.) “The first week of the show was – babies’ births and one of my marriages aside – the happiest week of my life.”But are there still people in her world who think they’re a bit edgy, who refuse to make the leap to Radio 2?“Oh yes, and I’ve had a few tweets from people saying: ‘OK, I’ve made the leap, you’ve got me now,’ but also from people saying they need a Radio 1.5, you know, like a panda-breeding programme where we slowly introduce them to Radio 2. But I don’t think we need it now because Radio 2 already sounds quite different from a couple of months ago.”A music team decides the playlist, “but I’ve got one of their mobile numbers now, which may or may not be good for him, because suddenly I’ll text saying: ‘Please can I play the KLF with Tammy Wynette?’ and he’ll go: “Oh Christ, OK then.’ But they’ve got a tough job to do because there are so many decades of amazing music out there. If it was up to me I’d play Beyoncé, Whitney and Minnie Riperton – just my birthing CD.”Did she use the same birthing CD for all three babies, I wonder. “Well, I swapped husbands between,” she replies breezily, “so I thought it deserved a remix at least.”With advice like this – change your birthing CD when you change your husband – she could have filled another sort of book altogether, since other publishers have asked her to write “a wacky mum’s handbook about how to be a bit crap at being a mum”. She makes a face. “I’m not a big fan of those ‘I’ve pushed a baby through my cervix so pass me my laptop, I’m now an expert and I’m going to do a clothing range as well’ types. I hate that kind of celebby advice book. Loads of women have had babies, love, you’re not unique – there’s one right now, crowning.”At the risk of sounding as cheesy as those publishers, I am curious about how she made her second marriage work. “We like being nice to each other and I think that’s really important in a marriage. You want to make each other happy and you want to do nice things for each other, whether it’s, you know, making a brew or being the ones to go and put the dogs away. Every weekend, he’s schlepping around, picking up the kids, driving them places and he doesn’t begrudge it, and that is just so attractive in a man. He never fails to step up.”Besides which, their bedroom is arranged so Ben sleeps nearest the door, “which was accidental, but actually it’s brilliant because the kids get to him first if they wake up in the night. He’s the speedbump they have to get over to get to me.”She still dreams of returning to the countryside, but he’s a born Londoner and they love their house in Willesden too much. Some years ago she walked out of a trendy London hairdressers, only to spot a big old lorry trying to navigate a tight bend in Fitzrovia. Having spent every school holiday accompanying her dad on his delivery wagon (where they would listen in hushed reverence to Radio 2), she found herself directing this driver, using hand signals, shouting out, “To me, to me, whoa,” until she’d got him round the corner. “It never leaves you. I take these tiny dogs for a walk but, in my head, I’m getting a horse in from the field. I’m always trying to get back towards some sort of farm-type life. Always trying to swim upstream.”In this extract from her book, Sara Cox comes down to earth with a bang“Just jump!” So I did. It didn’t go well. Let me explain. I was perched on the end of the loft platform in the barn on the farm where we lived. It was summer, just before haymaking when all the lovely fresh hay would be brought in by an army of pals and helpers, fuelled by tea.Now, though, the barn was almost empty save for a few old bales on the dusty floor and a pile of half a dozen or so right next to the loft. These were to be my crash mat. All I had to do was launch myself from my position and push away from the wall, gliding majestically on to the scratchy landing below. It was a drop of perhaps 8ft, but to my seven-year-old mind the chasm below might as well have been the Grand Canyon. Or, seeing as this was Bolton, the “Reet Grand Canyon”.My older sister Yvonne was the one encouraging me to jump. I was grateful that she was playing with me so I was keen to impress. As the youngest of five I was used to being a walking, talking booby prize to my older siblings. An unwelcome addition.Back then I was half girl, half forehead – a trait that was a target for classmates, both figuratively, with a plethora of nicknames (slaphead, fivehead, fodder), and literally, as they’d heartily slap it while running past, high-fiving my fivehead. So the fact my sister had agreed to hang out with me and my forehead was a big deal. Sure, the downside was she wanted me to jump to certain death for her own amusement, but at least I’d die knowing I wasn’t a chicken.I took a deep breath. I jumped. I didn’t push away from the platform, though, I sort of nudged my bottom over the edge, so instead of springing away from the wall I slid down it like a blob of custard dripping down a kitchen tile.In fact, I stuck so closely to the wall that I didn’t even make it on to the bales below but tumbled between them and the wall, like a lost mitten down the back of a radiator. I looked up to see my sister’s horrified face frozen in a grimace – part sympathy, part worry in case I grassed her up to Mum.The good news was I didn’t die. The only evidence of my misjudged jump was the two red raw tramlines down my back that made me look like I’d been mowed down by a joyrider in a Silver Cross pram.Extracted from Till the Cows Come Home (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £18.99).

She replaced Goodloe Sutton, 79, the longtime owner of the paper who wrote the editorial that prompted rebukes from elected officials and the public and made national and international headlines.Sutton, who led the publication for 50 years, initially refused to apologise or back down. He told the Montgomery Advertiser he wrote the editorial, which called for a return of the Klan and railed against Democrats, who it said were “plotting to raise taxes in Alabama” and who it blamed for US entry into the first world war, the second world war, the Korean war, the Vietnam war and war in the Middle East.“If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out DC,” he told the Advertiser, “we’d all been better off”.Asked to elaborate, he alluded to lynchings, saying: “We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.”In a subsequent interview, he was quoted as saying: “Lady, I don’t give a shit. I’m quitting.“You can tell everybody you ran me out of the newspaper business.”The Klan began as a white supremacist group that terrorised blacks in the US south in the mid- and late 19th century, following the civil war and the end of slavery and with the aim of suppressing the black vote.Initially suppressed by the federal government, then surpassed by Jim Crow laws, it rose again in the 20th century to participate in an epidemic of lynchings, extra-judicial murders of black Americans, and attacks on other minority groups. In the 1960s, it opposed protests in the name of civil rights and legislation to enshrine such legal protections.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit which monitors extremist groups, the Klan remains active although it has been “greatly weakened by internal conflicts, court cases, a seemingly endless series of splits and government infiltration”. The SPLC estimates membership to be between 5,000 and 8,000.“Good riddance Goodloe,” Senator Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat, tweeted in response to the news of Sutton’s exit. “His dangerous views do not represent Alabama or the small-town papers in Alabama that do great work every day.”The Democrat-Reporter, which is nearly 150 years old and does not publish online, had a circulation of about 3,000 in 2015, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.In its statement announcing its new editor and publisher, the paper said: “The Sutton family devoted this newspaper to integrity and excellence in journalism which has been led over the past 50 plus years by Goodloe Sutton and his wife Jean.”Sutton and his wife won acclaim in the 1990s for a series of articles in the Democrat-Reporter that detailed corruption in their local sheriff’s department. Jean Sutton died in 2003 from cancer, according to her obituary.The Democrat-Reporter said Dexter was a graduate of Eastern Illinois University, Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership, in Chicago, and Argosy University, a national and online institution.She has “strong roots and a rich history” in the area, the paper said, adding that she will continue the paper’s journalistic tradition while moving it in a new direction.“Ms Dexter is coming in at a pivotal time for the newspaper,” it said, “and you may have full confidence in her ability to handle these challenging times”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a869bdfb809c31d2b3c967794635ac647c49fc6/0_276_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e627ab51b767e1a309c63a9be6c67c0","title":"durty donald and kim jong yum burgers mark vietnam peace summit","story":"Hanoi restaurant menu celebrates meeting of US and North Korean leaders An Irish chef in Hanoi is serving special burgers to mark this week’s summit between the US president, Donald Trump, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.The Durty Donald and Kim Jong Yum will be on sale at the Durty Bird restaurant from Monday, as the Vietnamese capital prepares to greet the two leaders.The restaurant’s co-owner and head chef, Colin Kelly, said the burgers were designed to capture the spirit of the leaders.Kelly said the Durty Donald was as “extravagant” as Trump, with double beef and double bacon topped with strands of yellow chicken floss. “To match some of the controversy that surrounds him, we’ve put Russian dressing on it.

The UK has made important progress in this regard in April 2017, it enjoyed its first full day without any coal-fired electricity since the 1880s, which was a striking achievement for a country that had been at the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution.As the prime minister, Theresa May, said last year: “We can be proud of our success in facing up to the reality of climate change, but we are not complacent about the action needed to sustain that success in the future.”The best way for any country to avoid climate complacency is to develop robust, holistic and people-centred policies across government, so short-term trade or financial priorities do not trump the wider imperative of cutting global emissions.The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister’s words and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory.The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee is currently holding an inquiry into UK Export Finance’s (UKEF) financing of fossil fuels in developing countries. This government agency provides financial support for international trade with the aim of boosting British companies’ exports.Over the longer timeframe of 2010-16, it is estimated that UKEF provided £4.8bn of support for fossil fuel projects. The UK’s total spend on its International Climate Fund for a similar period, 2011-17, was £4.9bn.These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK’s commitments under the Paris agreement, its membership of the Powering Past Coal Alliance and its own pledge in 2013 to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas.They are also at odds with the view of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned in 2014 of the stranded asset risk inherent in fossil fuel projects.The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world.But as the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out so starkly, our target must be 1.5C if we want to avert irreparable damage to our planetary ecosystem – so even more radical action against fossil fuels is required.Meeting these challenges can only be done collectively, in a spirit of international and intergenerational solidarity under the framework of the United Nations.I was UN secretary general when the Paris agreement was signed, and the sustainable development goals agreed. I valued the UK’s contributions and commitment to both these vital multilateral achievements, and continue to believe the country can play a transformative role in shaping the global climate agenda.As deputy chair of the Elders I continue to call on G20 nations to move away from fossil fuel investment, and I believe the UK can play a leading role in this crucial move.I encourage the UK government to recalibrate its export finance policy so it is fully consistent with international climate trends and obligations.Promoting fossil fuel investments abroad locks in high-carbon infrastructure in developing countries for years to come, which is the opposite of sustainable development.There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations.The World Bank Group has already ended its finance to upstream oil and gas the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently ended finance to coal and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation has announced it is going fully fossil-free.UKEF and the wider UK government should use the occasion of the parliamentary inquiry to demonstrate a clear shift in policy away from fossil fuels and use its investments to support clean energy.If the UK takes these necessary steps, it can be at the forefront of the transition to a low-carbon economy. I look forward to seeing its government, industries and people rising to this challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15935ea32ef788b4008707937caeb4dc8b57941d/0_5_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3d28e163dce52cb57763b3f861d7f0","title":"okinawa referendum rejects new us military base but abe likely to press on","story":"Tokyo sees controversial plan for new base at Henoko as key to US security alliance Voters on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa have rejected the controversial relocation of a US military base in a referendum, according to local media, but the result is likely to be ignored by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.Kyodo news agency said its projection based on exit polls indicated that more than a quarter of Okinawa’s 1.16 million eligible voters had opposed the plan – a threshold that requires the island’s governor, Denny Tamaki, to “respect” its outcome. The public broadcaster NHK said a majority of voters had come out against the move supported by the Japanese and US governments.Sunday’s non-binding referendum asked voters if they opposed, supported or held neither opinion on the construction of a military base in Henoko, a fishing village on the island’s northeast coast that is home to coral reefs and one of the few remaining habitats of the dugong.The new facility is supposed to replace the marines’ Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a densely populated city on the island. Futenma has attracted complaints about crimes committed by service personnel, noise and the threat of aircraft accidents in an area close to homes and schools.Critics say the Henoko base will destroy the area’s delicate marine ecosystem and threaten the safety of 2,000 residents living near the site.Opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa surged after the 1995 abduction and rape and abduction of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen.A year later, Tokyo and Washington agreed to reduce the US military footprint on Okinawa by closing Futenma and relocating its functions to Henoko. But most Okinawans want the new base to be built elsewhere in Japan.Some voters complained that the government in Tokyo had routinely ignored their objections to the presence of US military personnel and bases.“There are so many American troops here. Of course, ninety-nine percent of them are good people, but then there is that one percent who do bad things. It’s hard for us,” Tomomichi Shimabukuro, who runs a seaside inn, said ahead of the vote.Political and legal challenges to construction work at Henoko have irritated US officials, who insist that marines are needed on Okinawa to respond to crises in potential regional flashpoints in the South and East China seas, as well as the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea.Abe has claimed the replacement base is the only way of easing pressure on residents living near the Futenma base while maintaining Japan’s commitment to its security alliance with the US.While the “no” vote is not legally binding, the government risks accusations of dismissing local sentiment out of hand if it continues with land reclamation work in the sea off Henoko.Jun Shimabukuro, a professor at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, said the referendum was an important opportunity for the island’s residents to make their voices heard. “It can be a test to gauge if democracy is working in Japan,” Shimabukuro said ahead of the vote.Tamaki, who was elected last September vowing to oppose the base relocation, described the vote as a “precious” opportunity to communicate Okinawa’s opposition to the central government.Col. John Hutcheson, a spokesman for US Forces Japan, said the relocation plan would enable the US military to close Futenma while protecting “vital capabilities” to ensure regional security.“We are committed to maintaining good relations with local communities on Okinawa and do our best every day to balance their concerns with the necessity to maintain readiness in support of our treaty commitments,” Hutcheson said, while declining to comment directly on the referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28f04755e2be00dc76c133e3e476c7b5fcbda4c/0_40_4872_2924/master/4872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f25466c275b0d7e85ab4ecbfd52383f","title":"venezuela standoff juan guaido nicolas maduro","story":"Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó is set to meet US Vice-President Mike Pence on Monday, after asking other countries to consider “all options” to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power.Guaidó’s comments came after a day of violence, as opposition supporters spent hours trying to break a government blockade and carry food and medical supplies into Venezuela. At least four people were killed and more than 300 hundred injured.“The events of today oblige me to take a decision,” Guaidó said on Twitter, “to formally propose to the international community that we should keep all options open to achieve the liberation of our homeland.”The 35-year-old, who transformed Venezuelan politics and united a fractured and ineffective opposition when he declared himself interim president in January, has repeatedly said his focus is on a peaceful transition and new elections.But his comments on Saturday raised concerns he might be considering a military intervention and were soon picked up by US hawks including the Florida senator Marco Rubio.“The grave crimes committed today by the Maduro regime have opened the door to various potential multilateral actions not on the table just 24 hours ago,” Rubio said in response to Guaidó, also on Twitter.On Sunday morning, he added: “The willingness of many nations to support stronger multilateral actions to dislodge them has increased dramatically.”US secretary of state Mike Pompeo was more circumspect, saying “further action will be contemplated” at Monday’s meeting of the regional Lima Group, in the Colombian capital Bogota, but focusing on sanctions, humanitarian aid and actions by Venezuelans themselves.“The Venezuelan people will ultimately I believe hold accountable those who have done so much harm to the fundamental basic rights of the people of Venezuela,” he told CNN’s State of the Nation.Donald Trump did not immediately respond to Guaidó, but he said last month “all options were on the table”, and has suggested invading Venezuela both in public and private.There have always been strands of the Venezuelan opposition who have called for military intervention, and as the standoff on Saturday dragged on, some in the crowd trying to push aid across the border called for the use of force instead.“We need a military intervention,” one opposition supporter shouted as she passed a news crew on the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, which links Cúcuta in Colombia with the Venezuelan town Ureña, a call that was greeted with cheers from others around her.David Smolansky, opposition leader in exile and close friend and ally of Guaidó, insisted they were not calling for troops on the ground.“It is still a peaceful movement,” he said. “Violence yesterday came from armed pro-government gangs and security forces.”But pressed on whether he would support military intervention in future, he declined to rule it out: “The only option we have is to restore democracy and freedom with internal and external pressure.”Analysts warn there is a serious risk of sliding into armed conflict, and say many of those pushing for intervention are underestimating the cost and possible impact of sending foreign troops to Venezuela.“Unfortunately the odds of the crisis escalating into conflict are still very real,” said Geoff Ramsey, assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America. “I think there are actors on both sides that actually think armed conflict could be desirable.“The clearest risk is that it would devolve into an internal armed conflict that could last decades. An intervention would be bloody, costly, and would likely rely on some kind of mid- or long-term occupation that would have to counter insurgent groups.”Discussions about military intervention in Venezuela have focused largely on taking on the armed forces. But there are also hundreds of thousands of people outside the military who are armed and experienced, from pro-government gangs to Colombian guerillas the ELN."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Second teenager in critical condition following incident in Borris at 5am on SundayMichael O\u0026rsquoBrien (44) brought before a special sitting of Mallow District CourtPostponement of Commons vote \u0026lsquodoesn\u0026rsquot change anything\u0026rsquo, says TaoiseachYouth stabbed on Liffey Street at around 2.50am on Sunday morningBoard members resign over party\u0026rsquos response to claims about local election candidateTax breaks being considered to encourage people to move to \u0026lsquoage-friendly\u0026rsquo housing estatesNTA bought 150 buses months before ban introduced on diesel-run vehiclesIn the justified rage of the people the Church sees a reflection of God\u0026rsquos wrath, he saidGirl (12) remains in critical condition after rowing boat capsizes near Salmon Weir in LimerickJon Jonsson, a 41-year-old father of four vanished on February 9th\u0026lsquoThis has been an extraordinary week\u0026rsquo National Lottery chief say after second jackpot win in one weekFirst ever such summit to be held will be attended by 49 countries from the regionsFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says Brexit could not be tackled with \u0026lsquopolitics as usual\u0026rsquoParty chairman and vice-chair step down in protest over its response to claims about candidateYoung girl was trapped underwater after hair became tangled in vessel\u0026rsquos outriggersSDLP leader echoes Donald Tusk in criticism of Sinn F\u0026eacutein at Fianna F\u0026aacuteil ArdfheisMinister for Health urged to intervene to ensure Philomena Canning gets treatmentMiche\u0026aacutel Martin says deal with Fine Gael not an issue in terms of his leadership"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803656.1551011475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"marine board formally requested to investigate boating incident","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFire and Search and Rescue personnel on Shannon river this Saturday morning after a boat capsized in front of Athlunkard Boat Club.

The overturned boat was found by members of Limerick Fire Service who we’re performing a routine check of the river.The firefighters cut the girl free from underneath the boat as her hair had become entangled in the boat’s outriggers.They performed emergency first aid on route to a slipway in Limerick city where the girl was met by paramedics who helped stabilise her.The girl was taken by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick, but has since been transferred by road ambulance to Temple Street Children’s Hospital in Dublin. She remains in a critical condition. Members of the boat club where the girl had set off from have so far not made any comment.It is understood a support boat was travelling along side the girls’ boat at the time it capsized.It is unclear if the girls were equipped with flotation or life jacket devices.Gardaí said they had to wait until 9.30pm last night for a low tide to safely remove the boat from the river.The boat will be examined as part of the investigation into why the serious incident occurred.The (MCIB) conducts investigations into marine casualties in Irish waters.Eye witness Danny Ryan said he will be “forever haunted” by friends of the girl “screaming” for him to help them after their boat ran into difficulty in the river.“I could see the boat turned over and a girl waving and screaming.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesThe EU can offer Britain “assurances” on the Brexit withdrawal deal but will not provide something which alters its fundamental shape, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar also said the timing of another vote on the deal in the House of Commons is “not under my control”.British prime minster Theresa May has postponed a vote that was due to take place this week until mid March, just weeks from Brexit day at the end of March. “For the European Union, that doesn’t change anything,” Mr Varadkar said at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. “It doesn’t change anything from Ireland’s point of view either. “We are not playing chicken, we are not playing poker. We are just standing by our position which has been solid from day one.”The Taoiseach said any reassurances on the deal cannot “contradict the legal reality” of what has already been agreed. He will meet Mrs May and other EU leaders on the margins of the summit to discuss Brexit.At the centre of the continuing Brexit impasse is the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border if the EU and UK fail to agree a trade deal after Brexit which would keep the border open. The backstop would see the UK as a whole remain in a customs union with the EU, with add ons in both customs and regulations for Northern Ireland. Many Brexiteer MPs fear it could tie the UK permanently into the EU’s economic orbit, although it is only intended to remain in place “unless and until” a trade deal which keeps the border open is agreed. The difficulty in passing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, through the House of Commons has increased fears of a crash out, no deal Brexit at the end of March. TransitionAgreeing a deal would see the UK enter a transition phase until the end of 2020, although this could be extended. This would effectively maintain the status quo, with the UK staying in the European single market and customs union even as it is not a full EU member. “Let’s not forget this March 29 deadline is a self imposed deadline,” Mr Varadkar said. “It is one that the United Kingdom has imposed on itself. Nobody in Ireland or the EU is threatening no deal. This is a situation the UK has created for itself.”Mr Varadkar again ruled out a time limit or unilateral exit clause for the backstop, as has been pushed for by London. “The whole point of the backstop is to give us an assurance that we won’t see the emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, no matter what else happens as a consequence of Brexit.”When asked if an addendum to the withdrawal agreement could be drawn up to reassure the British government, the Taoiseach said: “The withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and backstop, are not up for re-negotiation. “We’re happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to have further confidence that the backstop if ever applied, will not be permanent. It will only apply unless and until something supersedes it. “So we are happy to talk about mechanisms to give them that reassurance that some of them need. However, we can’t agree to something that would contradict the legal reality or the spirit behind what has already been agreed.”He repeated that there are “no plans” for border checks with Northern Ireland in a no deal scenario. However, he said: “We do appreciate that in the event of a no deal we’ll be under obligation to protect the integrity of our single market, our customs union, which we are part of and intend to be a full member of.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Financial incentives will be offered to encourage older people to downsize from larger family houses to retirement home-type communities, under new Government plans, to be published in a report on Wednesday.Incentives being considered include allowances around stamp duty and capital gains tax rules, according to Minister of State with responsibility for older people Jim Daly. The plans would see the development of “age-friendly” housing estates for older people, where they would live in own-door accommodation. The communities would be supported with services, such as primary care and nursing staff, and on-call care attendants.The housing would be an “alternative” to the nursing home model, Mr Daly told The .Under the plans elderly people would “still get to live behind their own front door”, and benefit from the independence that comes with that, compared with a residential nursing home, he said. The State providing “small supports” to such communities, would enable people to live independently for longer, Mr Daly said. The Government was looking at ways to incentivise people to sell their homes and downsize to the retirement-type communities, he said. Options under consideration could include breaks on capital gains tax, or on stamp duty for the “age-friendly” homes. “Those discussions still have to take place with the Department of Finance,” Mr Daly said. The report, to be launched on Wednesday, was drawn up by the Department of Health and the Department of Housing. “We’ve never had any real alternatives to the nursing home model, that has been the same model for the last 30 years,” Mr Daly said. There was a general agreement among departments “we can do better”, in terms of housing options for older people, he said. The provision of residential housing for older people was a fast-growing area, with a boom in the private nursing home sector, he said. “A lot of care of the elderly, such as the nursing home sector, is provided privately, so they will be part of the discussion,” Mr Daly said. When it came to planning permission applications for nursing homes, the Health Service Executive should be a prescribed body, notified when new applications are made, he said. This would allow for more “joined-up thinking” between the private nursing home sector, and the health service, Mr Daly said.

Photograph: Nick BradshawA third member of the Social Democrats executive board has resigned, The  has learned. Chris Bond, who represents Dublin South West on the party’s national executive, stepped down at the same time as party chairman Joe O’Connor and vice chair Carly Bailey. A party spokeswoman confirmed Mr Bond’s resignation, adding that there had been no further resignations from the executive board. The departure of the three board members marks a deepening crisis for the party as it struggles to address issues around the candidacy of Ellie Kisyombe. Allegations of inconsistencies in the background history of Ms Kisyombe surfaced last week in the Sunday Times newspaper. Ms Kisyombe is originally from Malawi and has spoken of her experience of living in the direct provision system for much of the last decade. The party has become sharply ided over the issue after it was decided to conduct an internal review into her background. The decision to hold the review followed a discussion by the national executive that lasted several hours. It is understood that the national executive vote on the review was 9-2 in favour of carrying it out.Social Democrats co-leaders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall raised concerns about the impact of the controversy, while other members are determined to stand by the candidate. Ms Kisyombe, who has lived for some years in the direct provision system, received considerable media attention when she announced her candidacy. It is understood the party has not yet discussed the planned review process with Ms Kisyombe. When contacted on Sunday she did not wish to comment on the controversy. The National Executive of the Social Democrats met on Sunday morning when Peter Tanham (Dún Laoghaire) was appointed as interim party chair and Sally Aquilina (Meath West) as interim party vice-chair.ConcernA spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said at the weekend that “the co-leaders wrote to the national executive and expressed concern at the allegation that there may be some inaccuracies in Ellie’s back story, while also appreciating the complexities and severe difficulties posed for those caught up in the asylum process”. “As a result, the national executive subsequently met and has decided to carry out a review to work through this with Ellie.”An email from party chairman Mr O’Connor, seen by The , states that he hoped to avoid the step.“However, I cannot stand over the decision made by the national executive last night, or how the party intends to proceed from here,” he said.“I believe we have been forced to view this issue through a narrow lens, and as a result seem intent on pursuing a course of action which I believe is wholly inconsistent with the interpretation of a majority of our members and supporters, and will as a result inflict irreparable damage to the party in my view.”Mr O’Connor wrote that alternatives to the course of action chosen by the Social Democrats were and are available, “if our response to this issue had not been framed with a pre-determined outcome from the start”.Ms Bailey, who is vice-chair of the party and a general election candidate for the party in Dublin South-West said she “cannot stand over a decision which includes a statement that will go to the media, which in effect could and will be construed as the party essentially abandoning a candidate and especially one so vulnerable as a person living in direct provision”.The issue has caused major ision within the party, with the Dublin Central branch on Saturday evening contacting members to affirm its support for Ms Kisyombe.“Dublin Central Social Democrats remain dedicated to supporting our friend Ellie Kisyombe’s candidacy, alongside Carol Deans, for local election and would be both honoured and proud to have such fine candidates represent the North Inner City, as new and erse voices for transformative politics.”Other tensionsThere are also significant tensions within the party over the decision to contest the upcoming European elections, with the co-leaders believed to hold reservations around the party challenging for an MEP seat. The matter has led to a strain between the party leadership and north inner city Dublin councillor Garry Gannon, who is actively pushing to contest the Dublin MEP constituency this May. Internally the party has said it would not be funding a European challenge, and any candidate would have to self-finance their own campaign.Mr Gannon and the party’s political director Anne-Marie McNally had previously stated their intention to contest the selection convention for the Dublin MEP race. However shortly afterwards Ms McNally withdrew her name from consideration. In a message to a private Facebook group of party members, Ms McNally said she decided against challenging for an MEP seat following “detailed conversations with experienced people whose judgement I trust”. She said both the financial cost of running a European election campaign, and the “party’s interests” were considerations in changing her mind, according to the message, seen by The . She said instead she would focus on running in the local elections, and challenging for a Dáil seat in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, in the event of a general election. Ms McNally previously worked as Ms Murphy’s parliamentary assistant. In relation to the European elections, a party spokeswoman said “the challenge for a party of our size is how to prioritise our resources.” A decision was taken by the national executive to open a selection process for a candidate for the Dublin constituency, she said. “A number of candidates have come forward and the internal selection process is underway,” the spokeswoman said."},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"Future of Scottie dogs at risk as breed is classed as vulnerableVideo dispatch: How the Venezuela aid shambles descended into deadly violenceEmmanuel Macron apologises for \u0026#39humiliating\u0026#39 French as he reflects on gilets jaunes protests in new bookSaudi princess becomes country\u0026#39s first female ambassador with US roleGCHQ spy chief quit \u0026#39after links to jailed catholic priest emerged\u0026#39Female star of new BBC drama says Richard Gere deserves high wage packet because \u0026#39we\u0026#39re not equal\u0026#39EU condemns Venezuelan regime violence as pressure on Nicolas Maduro mounts after border deathsTheresa May delays Brexit vote for a fortnight and refuses to censure ministers demanding A50 extensionTom Watson directly challenges Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism, handing him dossier of 50 complaints Comment: Culture\u0026#39s last taboo: we all love a good snobComment: Will ‘woke’ David Lammy tackle his unconscious bias against the suburbs?Pope compares child sex abuse to human sacrifice as he promises to combat \u0026#39with the wrath of God\u0026#39Duchess of Sussex has henna tattoo as she and Harry visit schoolchildren in MoroccoComment: Our treason laws don’t address the fundamental wrong done to our country when people pursue jihad – betrayalComment: I helped found the ERG – accusations of extremism are ridiculousShamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Pianist determined to keep alive music of war hero killed at Battle of the Somme Pete Buttigieg sets out his case for 2020: \u0026#39We have to find a message which goes beyond Trump\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Future of Scottie dogs at risk as lack of numbers sees them classed as \u0026#39vulnerable\u0026#39Video dispatch: How the Venezuela aid shambles descended into deadly violenceEmmanuel Macron apologises for \u0026#39humiliating\u0026#39 French as he reflects on gilets jaunes protests in new bookSaudi princess becomes country\u0026#39s first female ambassador with US roleGCHQ spy chief quit \u0026#39after links to jailed catholic priest emerged\u0026#39Female star of new BBC drama says Richard Gere deserves high wage packet because \u0026#39we\u0026#39re not equal\u0026#39EU condemns Venezuelan regime violence as pressure on Nicolas Maduro mounts after border deathsTheresa May delays Brexit vote for a fortnight and refuses to censure ministers demanding A50 extensionTom Watson directly challenges Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism, handing him dossier of 50 complaints Comment: Culture\u0026#39s last taboo: we all love a good snobComment: Will ‘woke’ David Lammy tackle his unconscious bias against the suburbs?Pope compares child sex abuse to human sacrifice as he promises to combat \u0026#39with the wrath of God\u0026#39Duchess of Sussex has henna tattoo as she and Harry visit schoolchildren in MoroccoComment: Our treason laws don’t address the fundamental wrong done to our country when people pursue jihad – betrayalComment: I helped found the ERG – accusations of extremism are ridiculousShamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Pianist determined to keep alive music of war hero killed at Battle of the Somme Pete Buttigieg sets out his case for 2020: \u0026#39We have to find a message which goes beyond Trump\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000159430519_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget benefits screen time truly modern must teach children","story":"Perhaps the most modern thing we can do is to teach our children to exist beyond the world of screensHow did you learn your times tables?

That\u0027s the debate that\u0027s raging now.When asked if she would expect equality to take place on MotherFatherSon, she replied: No I wouldn\u0027t. If you take the argument that with experience and success comes with increased salary, maybe I believe in reward for longevity.We all know we\u0027re not equal. I\u0027m not saying that we shouldn\u0027t have equal opportunities. But we\u0027re not equal.Richard Gere in the new dramaShe added:  I suppose if we were of equal status and age… the truth is, I have absolutely no idea how much he was paid. And I’ve no idea how much any of us is paid.McCrory has spoken out about pay equality in TV and film in the past, saying in 2016: If you’re doing the same job, indisputably you should have the same money.McCrory is set to play Kathryn, the aristocratic estranged wife of Gere’s powerful media mogul character Max.The new eight-part drama, the first episode of which will air on BBC2 on Wednesday the 6th March, centres around the family unit, which is reunited when their son Caden, played by Billy Howle, suffers a breakdown.This will be the first time movie star Richard Gere appears in a TV show in 30 years - and the writer of the show said he took some convincing to take the part.Writer Tom Rob Smith has said he had to embark on a long wooing process to secure the actor.McCrory, however, said she had to gate-crash the auditions in order to get the part.She said: “My agent Nick Forgacs called me up to say there was a fantastic project floating about, but the only names that were reading it were big film stars.“He couldn’t tell me anything about it, nor were they sending it to me, but Nick’s excitement was palpable: ‘If I can get you into the room I think you’ve got a chance… but I’ve got to get you into the room first’.“So we gate-crashed the auditions basically. I was being offered various things during this process – I even declined a lead role in another series purely on the chance of getting this, because Tom Rob Smith’s writing is brilliant and it is one of the most original scripts I’ve ever read.”Future of Scottie dogs at risk as lack of numbers sees them classed as \u0026#39vulnerable\u0026#39Video dispatch: How the Venezuela aid shambles descended

princess becomes countrys first female ambassador us role","story":"Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud grew up between the US and Saudi ArabiaA Saudi princess has been named the country\u0027s first ever female ambassador, and its next envoy to the United States, amid strained diplomatic relations. Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud\u0027s appointment comes as the conservative kingdom is under international scrutiny over the alleged torture of imprisoned female activists and the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi. The kingdom’s strict ship laws were highlighted last month after teenager Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, made a dramatic escape from the country, citing an abusive family and state-sponsored oppression.Princess Reema, whose father Bandar bin Sultan al-Saud held the post from 1983 until 2005, grew up in the US and Saudi Arabia, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in museum studies from George Washington University.A high-profile businesswoman, she has worked in the public and private sector, notably as the CEO of a retail company with Harvey Nichols in its portfolio. She is also known for her advocacy work around women’s rights, increased women’s participation in sport, and breast cancer awareness. Princess Reema will take over the role from Prince Khalid bin Salman, the younger brother of  crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, who has been named Saudi deputy defence minister.The US envoy oversees one of Saudi’s most valuable relationships, which has been strained over the murder of Mr Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, and Saudi Arabia\u0027s war in Yemen. The two countries, are bound by shared interests in the Middle East, such as controlling an ascendant Iran, and hundreds of billions of dollars in arms deals.In May 2017, US President Donald Trump and Saudi King Salman inked a series of letters of intent for Saudi to purchase US$110 billion worth of US arms  immediately, and another $350 billion over 10 years.Many of these weapons end up in Yemen, which has attracted mild statements of concern from the US. Future of Scottie dogs at risk as lack of numbers sees them classed as \u0026#39vulnerable\u0026#39Video dispatch: How the

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel.

CHShe added: “In fact that’s why I\u0026nbspsat down with him in the first place. I\u0026nbspsaw an opportunity to pick someone so opposite’s brain and try to talk some sense into them which i understand is highly unlikely but I\u0026nbspwill not apologise for trying. That’s all.”Grande said in a follow-up message she was “anything but complacent” during her conversation with Morgan, adding: “I\u0026nbspwon’t stop having conversations with people I\u0026nbspdisagree with when I\u0026nbspsee the opportunity to.”Morgan shared a photo of himself with Grande earlier this week on Twitter, saying they had spoken for about two hours.“We laughed, we argued, she cried, I nearly did, the drinks flowed and\u0026nbspwe bonded,” he wrote. “Turns out we really like each other. Weird.”The message left some Twitter users baffled, including one person who wrote: “Ew Ariana why.”Someone else tweeted: “ARIANA NO,” while another person wrote: “Don’t like this.”In addition to their spat over Little Mix, Morgan criticised Grande after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing for not immediately visiting the victims of the attack. He apologised after Grande held the One Love Manchester concert, saying he had misjudged her.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: “We have taken action against Solarplicity to protect its customers from experiencing further detriment. “Solarplicity must get its house in order and provide a level of service that its customers expect.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Bank of England recently downgraded the outlook for growth. If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But might history actually be on the side of the new movement, asks Adam LusherClick to followThe IndependentMarkus Keaney, local Labour chair, says Shuker would be annihilated in a by-electionIt’s not every day you get to rock a flat cap and give a Trotsky turn of phrase to the BBC News from Luton.\u0026nbspBut Markus Keaney, chair of Luton South Constituency Labour Party, managed it all this week, when\u0026nbsphe discussed his recently departed ex-comrade Gavin Shuker, the constituency’s MP.Keaney looked forward to the day when the defector to the Independent Group would be “consigned to the dustbin of history” and\u0026nbsp“annihilated” by an official Labour candidate at a by-election.\u0026nbspHis words were uttered\u0026nbspwith the cold rage of a man who knows his local party committee procedure and is prepared to use it in the cause of “passionate new members enthused by the promise of a break from neoliberalism” – as he described the post-Jeremy Corbyn intake in his September\u0026nbspMorning Star article, written after a\u0026nbspno-confidence vote taken by party members against\u0026nbspShuker was carried.But, to refer to the context in which Trotsky popularised the “dustbin of history” line, who here were the doomed Mensheviks, and who the 1917 Bolsheviks arising to greet the new post-Capitalist dawn?\u0026nbspAs the Independent Group went cross-party with the arrival of three defecting Conservatives, were we witnessing the start of something like Emmanuel Macron’s French En Marche!\u0026nbspmovement? Or would Keaney still get his annihilation moment?\u0026nbspShuker and the Labour splitCould it be the Corbyn project that is doomed?\u0026nbspPerhaps lessons could be learned in Luton, a town with some claim to being a bit of a bellwether.\u0026nbspUntil\u0026nbspShuker upset the trend by getting elected for Labour in 2010, the Luton South constituency had gone to the party that won the general election in every contest since 1951.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted.

Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro.

Jennifer Lopez, Awkwafina, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Brie Larson, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg, Charlize Theron, Tessa Thompson\u0026nbspand Constance Wu will be handing out the statuettes.The show is also expected to focus on\u0026nbspwhat has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful\u0026nbspLady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of\u0026nbspA Star is\u0026nbspBorn\u0026nbspwith director and co-star Bradley Cooper.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u0026nbspwill perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u0026nbspand Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspProducer Donna Gigliotti\u0026nbspand director Glenn Weiss have meanwhile been tasked with bringing off a leaner show this time around, running under three hours for the first time since 1973.To achieve this, some of the lower-profile awards will be handed out while the broadcast is in commercial breaks, saving almost an hour after 2018’s telecast staggered on for a gruelling\u0026nbspthree hours and 53 minutes.Which films have been nominated\u0026nbspfor the top prizes?Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama The Favourite and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma secured 10 nominations each.Both films are have been shortlisted\u0026nbspfor the prestigious Best Picture award, along with Black Panther (a popular choice), BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book, A Star is Born\u0026nbspand Vice.The Oscar nominations prove change is coming – but not fast enoughThe Favourite‘s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.Christian Bale is hotly-tipped to win Best Actor for his role as former vice-president Dick Cheney in Adam McKay’s satire while the Best Supporting Actor category drew contrasting responses from a delighted Richard E Grant and a very droll Sam Elliott (“It’s about f***ing time”).The Academy has been criticised for again failing to list a female filmmaker in the Best Director category while fans of Timothee Chalamet were disappointed his performance as a drug addict in\u0026nbspFelix Van Groeningen’s Beautfiul Boy was overlooked.You can read a complete list of the nominations here\u0026nbspand an overview of the\u0026nbspbiggest talking points from the announcement here.What happened to the\u0026nbspBest Popular Film category?The new award was announced in August but withdrawn a month later on the strength of the hostile reception it received.Critics and fans argued the category would be used as a means of sidelining crowd-pleasing blockbusters like Black Panther, keeping Best Film free for the “prestige” pictures that usually dominate.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has said it “will examine and seek additional input regarding the new category” and has not ruled out its future revival.The Academy announced in June 2018 it had invited 928 new members of the filmmaking profession to join its ranks.Part of a new initiative commenced under former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the measure is intended to address the shocking revelation in 2016 that 92 per cent of membership was white and 75 per cent male.Invitations were extended to actors including Amy Schumer, Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman and\u0026nbspJada Pinkett Smith as well as a host technicians, directors and executives in a bid to improve ersity and offer a broader representation of opinion.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It was only when a flexible cover layer was developed that folding phones could happen.The Fold has a 4.7in screen when it\u0027s closed, looking like a regular smartphone, if a bit thicker. Then, it opens up to reveal a second screen inside, which measure 7.3-inches. To put that in context, many smaller tablets on the market boast 7-inch displays.So, how convenient, no need to carry two gadgets any more but still have the joys of the big screen. But, from seeing the new device, I have some initial reservations.First, the bigger display has a weird screen ratio. It\u0027s not quite square but at 4.2:3 is noticeably squarer than many tablets. Samsung displayed a Netflix movie on it, which looked great except that quite a lot of the screen was black bars on either side, which reduced the effect. I suspect it would have looked better on the smaller front display, where it would fill it entirely.This shape means you can display three apps at once, like a YouTube feed, Instagram and a web page. The YouTube element, even in the biggest window, only had a tiny video element, which also wasn\u0027t that appealing.These are early days, though, and there may well be a combination of apps which will work well together.Second, the display didn\u0027t look sensational. Although it opens perfectly flat and images can run across the two with no sense of a join, as the Fold tilted in the light, a straight line that looked like a crease was visible. Perhaps this was because it was an early sample and when the phone is released (26 April in the US, 3 May in Europe) this will have been sorted.Third, can it really justify the cost? In the US, the price starts at $1,980 and in Europe, $2,000. No UK price was given though expect it to be around £1,600 or more. For that money you could buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and a 9.7in iPad and have a lot of cash left over.But you wouldn\u0027t have the convenience of the two-devices-in-one that the Galaxy Fold turns out to be.\u0026nbsp And in terms of innovation, a folding phone is the most exciting development in phone design for years.Samsung Galaxy S10: Best network deals in the UKThe other phones look rather more ordinary in comparison, but offer noticeable upgrades from the current Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets.Both the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a pretty exciting innovation, a fingerprint sensor buried in the display itself that\u0026nbspallows\u0026nbspthe screen to stretch across the whole of the front of the phone. Well, almost.There\u0027s a tiny punch-hole in the S10 screen, a bigger one on the S10+, where the front-facing camera (or cameras on the larger phone) sit.Samsung says that the technology it\u0027s used, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, is the most advanced around and in my brief use of it, it\u0027s very fast indeed and in a day or so\u0027s use recognised my thumbprint 100 per cent of the time –\u0026nbspa little better than rival in-screen sensors from Huawei and others.There is a downside to this tech: It won\u0027t work through thick screen protectors, so check before you buy a protector for your phone.Both cameras also adopt triple camera units on the rear with two 12-megapixel sensors offering wide and super-wide lenses. The wide lens has an automatically adjusting aperture to allow more light in when there\u0027s not much there. The third sensor, backed by a 16-megapixel sensor, is an ultra-wide lens with a field of view which Samsung says matches that of the human eye.The new phones also have two-way wireless charging so that you can place a friend\u0027s wireless-compatible phone against the S10 or S10+ and charge it from the Samsung. Testing it with an iPhone XS Max, it worked instantly and is a very satisfying feeling. Huawei had this feature first, but it\u0027s something every phone should have.The S10e offered some of the S10\u0027s features in a smaller form, so every hand size may find something that fits. But you\u0027ll need big mitts to encompass the final phone release of the evening, the S10 5G. The difference here is, can you guess, it works on 5G networks. It\u0027ll be released in May and has a 6.7in display, the biggest Galaxy S phone yet.The Fold on its own puts Samsung out there when it comes to innovation, but the new Galaxy S10 range –\u0026nbspyou know, the ones most of us will consider buying –\u0026nbspoffer enough choice and a big step forward from last year\u0027s S9 range. The addition of the super-cool inscreen fingerprint sensor on the S10 and S10+ along with the new triple cameras will be enough to tempt many.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The watchdog said\u0026nbspSolarplicity’s\u0026nbspcustomer\u0026nbspservice “has been poor for a number of months”.Between March and September last year\u0026nbspthere was an unacceptably high proportion of calls abandoned and unacceptably long call waiting times, Ofgem said.Although call handling has improved, the regulator said it “has not seen the required improvements elsewhere”.Created with Sketch.Solar powered bulbs light the way in the developing world Show all 3Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Measures Ofgem has recommended include ensuring customer contact channels are improved, managed and maintained, with queries and issues being resolved in a timely manner, and making sure the switching process goes smoothly, with switches completed within the required timescales. Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: “We have taken action against Solarplicity to protect its customers from experiencing further detriment. “Solarplicity must get its house in order and provide a level of service that its customers expect.

Within an hour of liftoff, Beresheet was already sending back data and had successfully deployed its landing legs, according to SpaceIL.\u0026nbsp“We’ll keep analysing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft programme.\u0026nbspElon Musk’s SpaceX to have launches reviewed by PentagonElon Musk reveals price of a ticket to Mars on board SpaceX flightsPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was watching the launch live from the Israeli control centre in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.\u0026nbsp“This is a big step for Israel, but a giant step for Israeli technology,” he said.The four-legged Beresheet, barely the size of a washing machine, will circle Earth in ever bigger loops until it’s captured by lunar gravity and goes into orbit around the moon. Touchdown would be 11 April\u0026nbspat the Sea of Serenity.\u0026nbspNasa’s Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s took about three days to get astronauts to the moon, but they used monstrous Saturn V rockets.The $100m (£78m)\u0026nbspBeresheet mission could not\u0026nbspafford its own rocket – even a little one – so the organisers opted for a ride share. That makes for a much longer trip the moon\u0026nbspis currently nearly 230,000 miles\u0026nbspaway.\u0026nbsp“This is Uber-style space exploration, so we’re riding shotgun on the rocket,” Mr Winetraub explained at a news conference on the eve of launch.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspAir Force also has a small research spacecraft aboard the rocket, for a one-year mission in orbit around Earth.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Soviet Union was the first to put a spacecraft on the moon, Luna 2, in 1959.

Last month, China became the first country to land on the far side of the moon.\u0026nbspApollo 11 astronaut\u0026nbspBuzz Aldrin quickly offered congratulations following Thursday’s launch. So did Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine, who called it “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beyond low-Earth orbit and on to the moon”.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbsphas a laser reflector aboard Beresheet and is offering its Deep Space Network for communication.\u0026nbsp“All the best to @TeamSpaceIL as it starts its journey tonight on a @SpaceX #Falcon9 from Florida to my old stomping ground ... the moon,” Aldrin tweeted.\u0026nbspThe Beresheet mission originally was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even made the final cut before the contest ended last year without a winner. The organisers decided to press ahead on their own, with donations from billionaires as well as schoolchildren.\u0026nbspLunar surface operations are meant to last just two days. Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing site, and send back data and pictures. A time capsule is aboard the lander — which includes a picture of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003 — as well as a lunar library containing 30 million pages on a disk from the US-based Arch Mission Foundation.\u0026nbspRamon’s widow, Rona, was a big supporter of Beresheet she died of cancer in December.\u0026nbspFollowing liftoff, SpaceX recovered the first-stage booster, which flew twice last year. The booster landed smoothly on an offshore ocean platform, after the hottest re-entry yet, according to SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk. Sparks from burning metal were visible in the landing video.\u0026nbspMr Musk said the booster will fly a fourth time in April, during a launch abort test of the new crew Dragon capsule.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We don’t know what amendments are going to be selected. You haven’t even seen what motion the Government is going to put down – as I say, it won’t be the meaningful vote.We won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that that happens by March 12. But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March 29“I will be making a statement to parliament on Tuesday. And then, obviously, we’ll be having the debate the next day.”Ms Rudd, Mr Gauke and Mr Clark said earlier in the week that they would be prepared to defy the government in order to vote for a delay.They warned Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group that Parliament will block the UK leaving without a deal, stating that if there is one “they will have no-one to blame but themselves”.But despite their stance flying in the face of the government’s stated position, Ms May said: “What we have seen around the cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That is not a surprise to anybody.“We have around the cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.”Asked if the three ministers should remain in Government, Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbsprepeated: “What we see around the Cabinet table is strong views held on cthe issue of Europe.”Ms May said that extending Article 50 would not deal with the problem, but instead would only defer the decision on whether the UK should accept the prime minister’s negotiated settlement.She added: “There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not. And that will be a decision for every member of parliament across the house.“Every member of the commons will have to face that decision when that point comes. The government will be bringing back, working with the EU, and will want to put a deal to the House of Commons in a meaningful vote.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Europe Correspondent Jon Stone\u0026nbspwalks us through the examplesClick to followIndy PoliticsMerkel and Macron are not expected to come to Britain’s rescueEuropean leaders are gathering this weekend in Sharm el-Sheikh, where Theresa May hopes to discuss Brexit with them. But Britain’s exit from the EU is far from the only thing\u0026nbspon their minds. So how is Europe’s domestic politics affecting the Brexit process?Arguments over the status of Gibraltar play well in Spain, and Spanish governments of all stripes have tried to inject the issue into the Brexit process. So far this has been more of a nuisance than an existential threat, but Spain’s ability to veto any future trade deal could become a serious problem down the road. Spain disputes British sovereignty of the territory.Ireland is the EU country most directly affected by Brexit. In Ireland, to a much greater extent than the UK, a hard border on the island of Ireland is politically very unpopular. As a result, the Irish government has said it will not accept a border in any circumstances,\u0026nbspeven in a\u0026nbspno-deal scenario. This has caused problems of its own: Ireland’s position has made it harder for the EU to convince sceptical Brexiteers that the backstop is necessary.Emmanuel Macron isn’t going to Sharm el-Sheikh, but he has arguably been one of the most influential figures shaping the overall EU response to Brexit. A committed centrist, Mr Macron sees it as his duty to fight reactionary populism, a view shaped by the rise of the National Front in France. He sees Brexit as a strain of this politics and has pushed for the hardest line against Britain.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Constant predictions have emanated from Westminster that Angela Merkel would somehow ride to the rescue of the UK and cut a deal – but they have yet to materialise. In reality Germany is more focused on eurozone reform than Brexit. Polls suggest that Germans themselves are shocked and somewhat taken aback by the UK’s decision.Hungary’s government has had its fair share of run-ins with Brussels itself. As a result, it’s probably been the most supportive of the UK, occasionally breaking ranks to say Britain should be cut a good deal.Poland is in a similar situation to Hungary, being the subject of a rule of law investigation by the European Commission. One sign of Poland’s willingness to cross the commission was its foreign minister coming out and suggesting changes to the Northern Irish backstop. He was promptly shot down.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

We might end up with a second referendum which would do real damage to our politics.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“But more than that, all the Yvette Cooper amendment does, as well as taking power in this way, is to seek to extend, not to advance our effective movement towards a deal – it is not an answer to this situation we face, which is, ‘how can the House of Commons unite behind a deal?’”International trade secretary Mr\u0026nbspFox warned of the “great” consequences of failing to deliver Brexit, on a weekend in which local Tory associations passed motions demanding no deal remain an option.He said: “Taking no deal off the table would be to remove the single strongest card that we have in our negotiation with the EU itself and would therefore fundamentally weaken our position.“While I do not want to see a no-deal scenario, the risk of failing to deliver on Brexit itself it too great to be contemplated.”Commons leader Andrea Leadsom wrote in The Sun on Sunday making the case for the government’s current path, concealing a message for Remain-backing cabinet ministers in saying: “Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent – but so too is my determination, and the determination of this government, to deliver on the will of the first one.“Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.”Ms Rudd, Mr Gauke and Mr Clark said earlier in the week that they would be prepared to defy the government in order to vote for a delay.They wrote in the Daily Mail: “It is time MPs recognised the need to get a deal, accepted that this is the only deal on offer, and supported it.”But they also warned Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group that parliament would block the UK leaving without a deal, stating that if there is one, “they will have no one to blame but themselves”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Bank of England recently downgraded the outlook for growth. If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Now, he must apologise.”In the editorial, published on 14 February, Mr Sutton called for a “raid” on the homes of Democrats and “Democrats in the Republican Party” for “plotting to raise taxes in Alabama”.When asked to elaborate on his statement, he told the Montgomery Advertiser he wanted the KKK\u0026nbspto “clean out DC”.“We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,” he said.His final edition as editor of the paper\u0026nbsppublished letters praising the editorial on the front page, including one from a self-professed Klansman.Ms Dexter said she had spoken to Mr Sutton about his editorial.“I told him there were some different ways you could have made your point, she told The Associated Press.West Virginia lawmaker compared LGBTQ people to KKKMaduro claims \u0027warmongering\u0027 Trump administration controlled by KKKTrump campaign aide compares Democrats wearing white to KKKAlleged neo-Nazi terrorist \u0027posed for picture with son in KKK robe\u0027Following the publication of the KKK editorial, local journalists said they found a history of racist, sexist and homophobic editorials published by the newspaper.One allegedly claimed “slavery was a good lesson for the Jews” and another said “foreigners to America brought in HIV, AIDs, etc.”The Alabama Press Association voted to censure Mr Sutton and suspend membership of the Democrat-Reporter earlier this week.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But officials with the\u0026nbspAlbany County School District say\u0026nbsproads between the two become so treacherous for most of winter that it is safer and easier to run two separate centres.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis attends a Eucharistic celebration at the Regia Hall of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican within the fourth and last day of a global child protection summit for reflections on the sex abuse crisis within the Catholic Church.Supporters of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido gather to take part in a rally in Caracas, Venezuela braced for a showdown between the military and regime opponents at the Colombian border on Saturday, when self-declared acting president Juan Guaido has vowed humanitarian aid would enter his country despite a blockadeA worker walks amongst piles of rubbish at a garbage dump in Blang Bintang, near Banda AcehFirefighters at the scene of a fire in Dhaka.

You do it!’ Because you’re not, so until you do it, I’m the boss, How about that?”Why the Green New Deal strategy is doomed to failThe resolution, which has been proposed by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and senator Edward J Markey, sets out broad changes to American society which aim to reduce the effects of climate change.It\u0026nbspincludes\u0026nbspkey goals of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and 100 per cent renewable energy in the US by 2030.The proposal currently has the support of major Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.Senator Amy Klobuchar has said she would vote for the non-binding resolution but suggested she would oppose certain elements of the proposal when it came to the details of legislation.Former vice president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon have also supported the idea in principle.However, the resolution has faced opposition from fellow Democrats, such as California senator Dianne Feinstein.Ms Feinstein was recently filmed arguing with a group of school children over the proposal, saying she could not support it because “there’s no way to pay for it”.“I’ve been doing this for 30 years.

I don’t respond to that.”Senate\u0026nbspmajority leader Mitch McConnell has said he intends to bring forward a vote\u0026nbspon the Green New Deal, which would force Democrats to formally decide whether to back the proposal.The resolution is not expected to pass the Senate, which is controlled by a Republican majority, and the planned vote has been criticised by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as a cynical ploy\u0026nbspto split the party.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470186283-e1550618418677.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remainer brexit lies honda swindon","story":"They even dispute the car giant’s own bosses bluntly and repeatedly spelling out that it “is not related to Brexit”.It simply must be.

None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity.

They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t currently have effective treatments to offer patients but by raising money for research we can help fight this cruel cancer together.”They are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under  yet just two per cent of the £ million yearly research budget goes into looking for cures for brain tumours.Immunotherapies are the great hope in cancer medicine. They are drugs that harness the body’s own ability to kill cancer cells and it allowed Nicki, who died in August  aged just , the precious extra time to see her son Harry get married.And it was what Baroness Tessa Jowell turned to in Germany after running out of options in London.Nicki’s doctor, medical oncologist Paul Mulholland from The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, has already started the trial on NHS patients across the UK.The National Brain Appeal charity has helped raise nearly half of the £, target needed for the initial research but they need help to raise the rest.Paul told us: “A new approach is needed for the treatment of brain cancer. We are aiming to bring together the newest drugs together with the latest developments in scientic research to find a cure for this devastating disease.“This will be achieved through a rolling programme of clinical trials. Our first trial is open and is currently recruiting.It is called the IPI-GLIO immunotherapy trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma brain cancer patients in the UK.The next phase will be to run multiple, smaller trials where the trial design will be adapted depending on the results that are obtained.“This is the quickest route to finding a cure for brain cancer.“The National Brain Appeal is fund-raising for this programme of clinical trials. Without this valuable help this programme would not have started and NHS brain cancer patients are being treated with new drugs today thanks to the charity.“This was something that Nicki Waterman wanted and felt passionate about. She had access to immunotherapy treatment due to having private healthcare and she wanted this to be extended to NHS patients.“I’m sorry that Nicki is not here to see this achievement given that she was so powerful in raising awareness to help to make it happen. It is admirable how Nicki’s daughter Alex and her friend Hayley have turned the tragedy of losing their mothers into something positive by raising awareness of brain cancer and helping to raise money for these clinical trials.”Almost , people are diagnosed each year with a primary brain tumour -  people every day and they reduce le expectancy by on average  years - the highest of any cancer. Just  per cent of adults survive for five years after diagnosis.Alex and Hayley tragically know just how cruel this disease can be. Alex - speaking ahead of Brain Tumour Awareness Month which starts next week - said: “Brain tumours are so common, so deadly but yet receive such little funding. This is about finding a cure. I am so excited about these trials - and raising money to make sure that cure is found.“The Use Your Brain Campaign is about spreading some happiness while raising money and awareness.“Taking part is simple. We are asking people to do something kind - by giving a kind word to somebody who seems a bit down, stopping to chat to an elderly neighbour or just by listening to a friend in need - and then take a thumbs up selfie with the tag #useyourbrain.“And then the vital bit - donate to the appeal to help the research and stamp out this dreadful cancer.“I hope that this campaign spreads some happiness, kindness and fun too. We can all spare a couple of minutes a day to be kind to each other. It’s a no brainer!”Theresa Dauncey, Chief Executive of The National Brain Appeal, said that investment in brain cancer research has been ‘abysmal’She told us: “There is an urgent need for new treatments for this devastating disease We are so grateful to Alex, Hayley and the Sun on Sunday for their enthusiasm and support to help raise both awareness and funds for Dr Paul Mulholland’s clinical trials.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was just  years old.Ben was one of two injured Marines to share a flight back to the UK with Prince Harry.The royal was forced to come home after his secret frontline mission was revealed.Ben admits becoming a dad was the furthest thing from his mind as he set out on the path to recovery.It was a long journey — with his groin injury requiring a new op long after the blast.He explained: “It was not until two years after the explosion that I had the testicle removed and a  one put in. I wasn’t that worried about a testicle after all I had been through.“I was only  when I was blown up, and back then I only had myself to think about and didn’t knowI’d ever get a girlfriend let alone become a dad.“I was given a choice about the operation to remove a ­testicle but told it could affect the other oneI kept it.“So looking back, that was a good choice and a wise ­decision, although I really wasn’t thinking about kids.“I had hundreds of injuries with shrapnel wounds all over my body, and still have shrapnel in me so it wasn’t that big a deal for me.”As he recovered, Ben met old schoolmate Zara, who is a nurse, in a pub on a night out in Plymouth.Ben — who won a Sun Overcoming Adversity Millie in  — recalled: “We got on well and just started chatting. We knew each other but weren’t close at school, and when I was back in Plymouth and doing rehab I bumped into a few old school people.“Zara is chilled and good fun. We have a normal relationship — it used to be date nights, but now it’s boxsets.”The lovebirds — who have been together for five years — did not plan the pregnancy but were overjoyed when Zara discovered she was expecting.Ben had never asked medics about his parenthood chances or had a sperm count or checks on his other testicle.He said: “We were shocked but extremely happy I have always wanted kids and when it happened and Zara got pregnant it was a surprise. It was not planned.“The only conversation we ever had about it was a jokey one with her saying, ‘Are you all right down there ’“I didn’t know but just said, ‘Yes, of course.’“But there’s only one way to find out, isn’t there — and I have proved it works!”Such a happy future was something Ben could never have imagined in .He said: “When I was first injured I thought, ‘I am in so much pain I’d rather be dead.’“It has been dficult to stay positive because there is nothing positive about having your arm and leg blown off.“I have had my struggles and now it all feels worthwhile. Now I look at Albie and often think, ‘Le isn’t so bad.’ ”But becoming a dad threw up fresh challenges — similar to the ones he faced in the aftermath of the explosion.He explained: “The birth was great, but to be honest having a child was scary.“Everyone who becomes a parent is nervous but I guess it was more so for me.“It was a bit like when I was first injured and had to figure out things like getting dressed when I only had one arm. But you adapt to it and work things out.“Now I can change a nappy with one arm — I use my stump leg to hold Albie’s legs up and now he’s a bit older he helps me out, too. I also figured out a way of getting him in the car seat, by clawing both bits together. I like to take him to the park but I know I’ll miss out on certain things like playing football with him and running around.”Ben has prosthetics including a walking and running leg and a  arm, but rarely wears them when he is at home with Zara and Albie. He continued: “It is a pain when you do things like make two cups of tea and have to make two ­journeys to get them.“But Zara and Albie help out a lot and Albie carries things for me, like his iPad.” Although they have no immediate plans to add to the family, Ben and Zara would like more children.The former  Commando Marine said: “In the future I think we will have more but we are not in a rush and are happy with our lives at the moment.”Brave Ben, who in  became the first double amputee to complete the London Marathon, was initially handed a compensation payout of just £, for his horric injuries. It was later raised to £,.He invested some of the money in property, making money from buying and ­selling around Plymouth.But for the last two years, the war hero has been beset by more health problems.“It was a case of one step forward, two steps back and I had a lot of problems so have calmed down in the last couple of years.“I also suffered mentally — and one morning could not face getting out of bed.“I was thinking about Afghanistan a lot and having flashbacks. You get to the point you feel like jumping out of a window.“I went downhill and kept myself to myself.“I had what I guess was PTSD and I went to the ­doctor. I was given anti- depressants which I took for a while.“But I thought, ‘This isn’t helping — these are just sedating me, not making it better’ so I processed the problems myself.“I try to stay happy and positive but it is not easy because you never forget about losing your arm and your leg — you never fully recover.“I am soon going to have the th anniversary of being blown up, but I have Zara and Albie with me, which is great.”Ben now works as a motivational speaker, giving talks to banks and businesses.He said: “My story is now better, as there is more to it and it’s not just a case of how I got injured and ­survived. I enjoy it and a few weeks ago I gave a talk to , people at the Excel Arena in London. That was nerve-racking!”And Ben has inspiring words for dad-to-be and old pal Prince Harry, who dubbed Ben the “real hero” after they jetted home together.Ben said: “I am glad he is doing well.“He has had his struggles with losing his mother and what he saw in Afghanistan — he saw injures like mine first-hand.“I am happy he’s with Meghan and they are ­expecting. He obviously loves her and that is great.“We have both been through and seen a lot.“I’m sure I’ll see him again and I’ll congratulate him and wish him the best.”BEN McBEAN is a true hero.He almost paid the ultimate sacrice in Afghanistan, losing an arm, a leg and also part of his groin to a Taliban landmine.So it is wonderful news that, against the medical odds, the former commando has become a father for the first time.Ben and his young family are a supreme lesson in overcoming adversity.We salute you, Superdad!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That moment is forever in my head.Alfie went on to defy doctors expectations and lived for another five days - with his doting parents at his side the whole time.In total, the toddler spent the final  months of his le in Alder Hey Hospital.Alfie was born in May  and for the first six months of his le appeared a healthy and happy little boy.But doctors later diagnosed him with rare GABA transaminase deficiency - and revealed the heartbreaking news that there was nothing more they could do for him.A series of courts agreed with doctors decisions, prompting desperate Tom and Kate to campaign for him to be kept on le support in the hope he could be taken abroad for le-saving experimental treatment.Tom even met with Pope Francis who supported the couples fight for their son - but ultimately his le support machine was switched off.The parents continue to seek grief counsellors - with Tom saying: We are still understanding how to grieve.He added: I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face.“He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004650340341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber peat mum grandmother mothers day","story":"Amber, , was found hanged in bushes near her home in Mansfield, West Mids, in , three days after storming out during a row with her parents over household chores.Her grandmother Jenner Lancaster has revealed that she last saw Amber two years before her death on Mother’s Day, .Jenners son, Ambers dad Adrian, split with her mum Kelly in Christmas  and her gran only saw her two or three times afterwards.Jenner, , told the Mirror: He’s no angel but there’s no excuse for Kelly to have stopped Amber’s contact with me. It was cold and cruel.The last time Amber saw her gran she dropped round a Mothers Day card while her mum and stepdad Danny waited outside in the car.Jenner claims that she tried to see the schoolgirl again but Kelly had changed her number.She added: “Amber was so loving. She spent weekends with me and every time she went home she’d leave notes saying things like ‘love you, Nanna’.”Her gran is convinced that more could have been done to save Ambers le.She said: How could Amber’s cries for help have gone unheard  People will say ‘lessons have been learned’ but it won’t bring her back.”An inquest into Ambers death this week revealed that authorities missed  chances to save her le.Amber would often run away from home and was “emotionally abused” by her stepdad Danny Peat, the Nottingham inquest was told.The teenager made ious complaints to teachers about her family le and once claimed that Mr Peat had woken her up at .am and made her mop their kitchen floor.Amber also concerned teachers when when they had to feed her a breakfast of biscuits before her SATS exams or when staff spotted her wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms to class rather than her unorm.The youngster also complained that she had been banned from having a birthday and that her mum smashed her mobile phone up.The coroner said Amber could still be aliveauthorities had done their job properly.Nottinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board is likely to publish a serious case review into the circumstances around the tragic teen’s death in the coming weeks.Concluding with a narrative verdict at the inquest at Nottingham Coroners Court on Friday, Ms Bower said: In evidence, both Mr and Mrs Peat sought to present as concerned parents.Mrs Peat said she repeatedly asked Amber what was wrong but she would not answer.Mrs Peat said that as soon as she heard the door slam, she went to look for Amber.Their behaviour in going to the supermarket and then the car wash, of leaving a missing Amber with no way of getting into the property, and of waiting some seven and a half hours before calling the police, in fact fits squarely with the picture that neither of them was concerned in the slightest when Amber left the house.She added: Perhaps in light of the tragic outcome, both Mr and Mrs Peat would wish to believe that they demonstrated more care when Amber went missing.Turning to agencies involved in Ambers welfare, the coroner said: Considering Ambers age, her emotional immaturity and her undoubted vulnerability, and the absence of any professional ever having properly assessed Ambers risk of self harm or suicide, I am not able to determine, on the balance of probabilities, Ambers intention at the time of her death.My task has been hindered by the lack of information gathered by professionals as to Ambers thoughts, wishes and feelings.If the right questions had been asked, the information may have presented itself but I cannot speculate as to what that information may have indicated.Mr and Mrs Peat admitted that neither of them were worried when Amber stormed out of her home in Bosworth Street, Mansfield, on May , , because they believed she was close by and expected her to .Despite the youngster having a history of running away, Mrs Peat only called police to report her missing nearly eight hours later, at . am the following day.She admitted she should have called sooner, when she gave evidence at the inquest.The couple decided to go shopping, have the family car washed and have tea, during the time the youngster was missing.Although up to  police staff were involved in the search for Amber, her body was only recovered on June .Ms Bower concluded the medical cause of death was hanging.Speaking on behalf of Mrs Peat outside Nottingham Coroner’s Court, solicitor Amy Robinson said: “Like all parents, Kelly knows she is not perfect, but she has done, and continues to be, the best parent she can for her children.“While Kelly does not agree with all of the coroner’s findings, the coroner’s conclusion was that with the right assessment and support from the education, health and social care agencies involved with Amber and her family, it is possible that Amber’s le may not have ended the way it did and when it did.“Kelly wonders whether things could have been dferent had Amber and her family received more support and advice for Amber’s behaviour.”If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471495924.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle gets henna tattoo as her and prince harry visit education boarding house in morocco","story":"The seven-months pregnant Duchess revealed the design to two young girls on a visit to a school in the Atlas mountains - where she wowed kids by speaking French.Meghan told Rania, five, and two-year-old Rayhanna: Hi girls, so cute!

The Independent Group comes from a wide ersity of backgrounds, including a former lecturer, social worker, solicitor, entrepreneur, a GP and a church leader. We represent regions across the country, and in contrast to the heavily male-dominated Conservative and Labour Parties in Parliament, I’m proud that two thirds of our group is female. Where the established parties are out of touch and remote from people’s everyday lives, we’re a group of ordinary people who are seeking to do something which Westminster has forgotten how to do - represent modern Britain.   The experience of the last few years has made it clear for all to see that politics is broken. Poll after poll shows the public are crying out for politicians to roll up their sleeves and work together to solve the challenges we all face. Voters are understandably sick and tired of the same old partisan, tribal way of doing things which has let our country down for too long. It’s no surprise that people have switched off from political debate. Ultimately, the established parties’ failure stems from the way they’ve become increasingly narrow and factional, increasingly refusing to engage with other points of view. As a result, they’re incapable of showing the leadership we need and have failed to provide any sense of direction.  What has this meant in practice  Where the parties used to represent a ersity of traditions, they’ve become dominated by their extremes. The Tories have morphed into ‘Blukip’ where Jacob Rees Mogg’s ERG hold all the cards and the proud One Nation tradition has been lost. With Labour, we’ve seen disgraceful antisemitism flourish in a climate where no criticism of the party leadership is tolerated. And, in general, people feel they have to settle for voting for the least worst option or simply to make sure the other lot don’t get in. Many still vote for the established parties not because they want to but because they feel they have to. And whether you voted Leave or Remain in , the Brexit process has shown up the failure of both Labour and the Tories, and has left no one happy with what’s being delivered in the voters’ name. This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it hasn’t been an easy decision for any of us. We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not re-create the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence. As we embark on this new chapter, most importantly we want you to help us build a new movement, and we’re keen to hear from you. Join us, and help us forge a new, dferent kind of politics for Britain’s future.

John McDonnell and Peter Mandelson, and many others, have come together with the same messagecalling for unity, and arguing that this wrong decision will result in a long reign of Tory government. They are absolutely right. A split on the centre-left only benefits those on the Right. Whatever concerns these MPs have, you only have to look at history to see that the changes our country is crying out for only ever come about when Labour is in government.   From founding the NHS, setting up the Welfare State introducing the Equal Pay Act, establishing the National Minimum Wage to delivering Sure Start. A strong and powerful Labour is the ONLY route to a fairer Britain. But we do need to reflect too on the reasons why some MPs left. I’m sorry that my friend Luciana Berger was pushed out of our Party because of vile antisemitism and bullying. The Party leadership must redouble their efforts to root out this evil racism perpetrated by a minority of members.   The Momentum wing must also down tools and bring an end to internal point-scoring, the threats of deselections, and a belief that only one viewpoint is valid. We must all respect and value dferent opinions, and take the bile out of politics, on and offline. We must be a broad church. This has been one of the worst weeks in the history of the Labour Party. The challenge now is how we react to it. We can either come together stronger than ever, or fail the test we have been set, and be complicit in the longest reign of a destructive Tory government in a generation.

My mum had also suffered from debilitating periods, but she was part of that generation who just gets on with it. I assumed that everyone was in monthly agony so bad that they’d have to take several days off school. But chatting to my friends, I realised that wasn’t the case at all. It wasn’t until an aunt persuaded me to go to the doctors that I realised just how much of an impact it was having on my le. I was diagnosed with endometriosis and adenomyosis – painful conditions that cause your womb lining to grow abnormally and in other places, such as in the oies and fallopian tubes. I also had a large number of uterine fibroids, which are lumps, growing in my uterus.  Having a name for my condition was a relief in a way, but it was frightening to realise I was up against a lelong battle with pain. In my s, I had endless investigations and saw many specialists as my fibroids grew larger and larger. I started to experiment with herbal remedies and meditation, searching for a way to help my body out. My stomach was huge and bloated from the fibroids, and I felt permanently self-conscious. On beach holidays with my girlfriends, everyone  would be wearing bikinis, but I’d be hiding my tummy under a sarong. I met and married a wonderful man called Tim, and he was supportive when I told him I’d never be able to have children. We built a nice le together, and I worked hard to take care of my health. This was how I found my calling as an Integrative Wellbeing Therapist, helping other women through their health problems with a combination of mindfulness and counselling.But as the years went on, the pain became worse and worse. My uterus became so bulky that it affected my day to day le. I’d always run four or five times a week, something I relished and looked forward to – but my stomach was so bloated it felt like it was bearing down on me. Probably how it feels to be pregnant. Doctors offered me two choices: a hysterectomy, or an embolisation of my fibroids, a gruesome procedure that involved burning large parts of tissue. Knowing that I couldn’t have children, I decided to go for the full hysterectomy. There was an option to keep my oies, which would mean my body would carry on producing oestrogen. But after  years of extreme monthly pain in which I could feel myself ovulating, I decided to have them removed too. Without oies, my body would be plunged into the menopause overnight, but my gynaecologist advised that I’d be able to have HRT a couple of months after the operation. Although I’m an alternative therapist, I know that the women in my family suffer from very bad pain in their hips and legs after the menopause, and I was determined to use HRT to help me carry on with my active lestyle.When the day of the procedure came around, I was nervous. Looking back, I thought I was prepared, but I wasn’t at all. It’s such a major operation, with my organs scooped out through a C-section cut. It was all over in an hour or two, but when I woke up, I was in agony and felt very ill. I spent three days recovering in hospital. The surgeon had cut through the stomach muscles to get to my womb, and without the muscles I was hobbling around and barely able to stand up. But six days later, things began to get even worse. Tim, who’d taken time off to look after me, had ed to the office and I was alone in the house when I realised I couldn’t breathe. After years of suffering with endometriosis, I thought I was immune to other pain and I generally have a very high threshold. But I was struck with horric, debilitating pain in my ribs. Terried, I staggered out into the street. Luckily, a neighbour saw me and rushed me to the hospital. I was pumped full of so much morphine that I could barely understand it when doctors told me I had several bilateral blood clots across both of my lungs. Put plainly, my le was at risk –one of the clots was to break loose, I could die. I told the doctor this wasn’t my time to go.I also had pleurisy, water on the lungs that had caused the excruciating pain. The blood clots themselves were symptomless, so without the pleurisy I may not have known about the clots until it was too late. For the next two weeks I was confined to my hospital bed. Doctors were baffled by the number of clots because I was relatively young, healthy and fit. I could barely walk and struggled for breath, but my mum and sister would sit by my bedside and massage my scalp and hands, and this lted my spirits a little.Eventually, I was allowed to go home, dosed up on blood thinners and with instructions to rest. But doctors didn’t want me to take HRT because of the risk of clots, so I ed home, sick and exhausted, mourning the loss of my womb, with the menopause well underway to boot. It was the lowest time of my le. For months, I was struggling beyond belief. My hair began to fall out and I suffered from  hot flushes a day that left me feeling like I was burning from the inside out. The pain in my hips and legs became so bad I could barely walk, and was hobbling around in agony. I thought, ‘Is this my le now  Am I never going to walk properly again ’ As my oestrogen levels plummeted, my vagina dried out completely until it atrophied. You don’t hear many people talking about the feeling of the vaginal wall in these circumstances, but it was incredibly distressing – the inside surface was hard and prickly like a conker shell.All these physical symptoms led to a deterioration in my mental health and I developed anxiety, which would manest itself in palpitations and a panicked feeling at bedtime. I’ve seen so many clients going through terrible menopausal symptoms and I knew how isolating it could be, but nothing prepared me for how bad it would feel. I took things into my own hands,taking a range of supplements such as Menopace, sage tablets, and vitamin D.  I also consumed large amounts of turmeric, which is nature’s anti-inflammatory and, slowly but surely, I began to feel better. Plus, I massaged my vagina with rosehip oil, which improved the dryness immeasurably.Six months after the operation, doctors allowed me to start on a low-dose HRT patch. The pain in my hips improved within a few weeks, and I began gentle, daily yoga, which really helped ease the pain and boosted my flexibility.A year on, and I feel like a new person. The first time I was able to run again, I felt so euphoric it was like I’d climbed a mountain – I was just so relieved. These days, I feel empowered and in control of my own health. I know how to look after myself, I’m not afraid to talk about my health, and I feel equipped to help other women too. Just keep moving forward, one step at a time."},{"url":null,"title":"alfie evans dad says new","story":"NewsAlfie Evans dad says new baby has given him a reason to live after sons deathWATCH EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Dad Tom, , says the six-month-old is the double of his brother and has helped him and his partner Kate James cope after Alfies tragic deathShareByPhil Cardy:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video father-of-alfie-evans-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe father of “right to le” shytoddler Alfie Evans cradles his new baby son and tells how the tot has given him a reason to live. Little Thomas Evans is the double of Alfie – the -month-old who died after a heartbreaking legal battle by his parents. Thomas is six months old and his dad Tom today reveals how having a new baby has brought a joy he and partner Kate James feared they would never experience again. Tom, , told the Sunday Mirror: “Thomas is Alfie’s double, the resemblance is amazing. “When we see Thomas pull a face he looks like Alfie, we feel that in a way we have them both with us.  “He’s such a happy baby, he does nothing but smile. I had a great connection with Alfie and I feel like I’ve got the same with Thomas. “We’re hanging in there, keeping sane, doing as well as we can. I wouldn’t know where I was without baby Thomas. “I’ve got something to wake up to with him. I have to keep happy for Thomas’s sake. I wouldn’t want to wake upit wasn’t for the baby. “I don’t like to think what it would be like without Thomas. I worryhe wasn’t here, where would I be  “How would I be  What would my mental health be ”   Tom was speaking as he and Kate revealed a pound, fund for Alfie will be spent on helping sick children. The proud dad added: “When Thomas gets older we want him to understand what Alfie went through and he can know good came from it. We’d like to help children around the UK and the world.” The picture of Tom and Thomas is a ray of light after two years of pain and torment. Tom and Kate had fought to keep Alfie on a le support machine in a case which drew global attention. They lost, ultimately, and their son died at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital from an ultra-rare degenerative brain disease. Kate, , fell pregnant with Thomas as the legal battle – which taxed her and Tom to the limits – was played out. But the couple stayed together through those tough times and are now devoted to Thomas. Tom said: “Kate is a great mum for Thomas. She has moments when she’s upset and she has a cry. That’s what you have to do to release the emotion. Mums have that bond, especially with the first child.” He accused doctors of separating him and Kate in hospital and telling her that the legal battle was wrong. Tom went on: “It was hard. She questionedwe were doing the right thing. I told her what we were doing, what our friends and family were doing, was the right thing for Alfie. But it wasn’t easy. It was hard for her to hear the arguments of the doctors every day. There was a lot of strain, but we stayed together. “We both loved Alfie and both wanted the best for Alfie. “We remained tough. They were telling her I was wrong. She was pregnant and her hormones and emotions were all over the place.”  The arrival of Thomas triggered a wave of emotions for the couple. Tom explained: “I was nervous but felt happy. We had the test done and he didn’t have the same genes as Alfie, we were told he would be okay. “We were happy that Alfie had a brother, it’s just that Alfie wasn’t there with us. “It was hard because the first time we had a beautul boy and we lost him. “Then when we had Thomas there were tears of joy, but it felt dferent because we had lost our first boy. “We were the same parents Alfie had at home, just in a dferent position, more tense. “ We still speak about Alfie, but we don’t speak about the hospital. We talk about how he is going to help save a lot of children in the future.”  Tom tearfully told how he gave Alfie mouth-to-mouth as his le ebbed away in the early hours of April  last year. With tears rolling down his cheeks Tom said: “I think about that moment every day. That moment is forever in my head. “I was giving him mouth-to-mouth, I could hear him breathing, like a sigh. It gave me more encouragement to keep trying. The noises kept coming and coming. But Kate was saying ‘Stop it, you’re just expanding his belly’. I didn’t want to stop. But I knew he was dead. At the very last moment his colour went. “The police and doctors and nurses were looking through the door, standing there. “I said to them ‘Can’t you do anything ’ They pulled his le support out and thought he would die in three to four minutes. But he lived for five days. We put him on our knees and sang to him, cuddled him.   “I said right to the end that their treatment of him was shyinhumane. “I do feel bad for the nurses because they didn’t have the power. All they could do was stand and watch for five days while oxygen and food was withheld. Up until the last I thought we were going to save him. I tried every avenue. “I was just a dad who wanted the best for his son.” Alfie was born in May  and while initially healthy he fell seriously ill at six months old. He was in Alder Hey Hospital for the last  months of his le. Doctors found he had the rare brain condition GABA transaminase deficiency. They said there was nothing more they could do and advised that Alfie should be allowed to slip away. A court agreed – prompting Tom and Kate’s long battle to overturn the decision, in the hope that Alfie could be taken abroad for le-saving treatment. They appealed to UK and European judges and Tom even met Pope Francis, who backed the couple. But ultimately the courts ruled Alfie’s le support could be switched off. Tom said he and Kate still see grief and bereavement counsellors as they strive for the best way forward. And he is determined to stay strong. He added: “We are still understanding how to grieve. “I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face. “He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.” Alfies legacy to help other seriously ill kids Alfies dad Tom says a pound, fund raised in his name will now help other seriously ill children. The sum came from an “Alfie’s Army” fundraising page set up during the legal battle to pay for potentially le-saving treatment in Italy or Poland. Hundreds of supporters also joined demonstrations in support of Alfie. The family has applied for charity status and has already provided wheelchairs and sensory equipment for disabled children. Tom said: “When we get something we think ‘Alfie bought it for them, Alfie is helping that person’. We’re happy that his name can live on in other parents’ and children’s minds.” The Alfie’s Army page states: “We don’t want any other family going through what we have... we are hoping to open a foundation to help other families get the help they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby ps mum tracey connelly","story":"NewsBaby Ps mum Tracey Connelly hopes to start new le outside jail with boyfriendTracey Connelly was jailed indefinitely for allowing her toddler son to be killed in  but sources inside HMP Low Newton say shes planning for futureShareByTim Wyatt:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsTracey Connelly, the infamous mother of Baby P, leaving a bail hostel after her release from prison in  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mother of murdered toddle Baby P is reportedly making plans to rebuild her le with a new partner outside jail. Tracey Connelly was given an indefinite sentence after she admitted allowing her then-boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother to kill her son Peter in . But sources inside HMP Low Newton in County Durham told the Daily Star she planned to apply for parole by the end of the year. Connelly has apparently fallen in love with an old friend called Paul, and hopes to start again with him should she be released. She has been swooning about the County Durham jail, telling other inmates about her new relationship, according to the reports.  If she is released she plans to move in with Paul, away from the nastiness of the past, the newspaper said. Connelly pleaded guilty to standing by while her then lover Barker and his brother Jason Owen repeatedly abused and tortured her toddle son Peter. The tragic tot suffered injuries including a broken back, shattered ribs, missing fingernails and mutilated fingers - most of which were missed by social workers and doctors in the months leading up to his death in August . A post-mortem after Peter died found he had swallowed a tooth after being punched. Connelly was first released on licence in  but was recalled back to jail just  months later after she was accused of selling indecent images of herself.   She applied for parole again in December  but was turned down after officials decided she was still a danger to the public. But sources inside the prison told the Daily Star she believes her new beau could turn things around for her. She’s telling everyone around how she knows it’s the real deal because she knew him before she knew Steven . She said she knows he won’t be with her because of her notoriety. “The sad thing is when she was released last time she had loads of weirdos getting in contact with her, turned on by what she was imprisoned for. It makes you sick. “But she’s saying she knows this Paul, and he knows her from before.   Tracey was overheard telling people that Paul knows she is a ‘good person’ deep down and knows she isn’t this evil character people make her out to be. She is deluded.” Connelly was reportedly given permission to contact her family and other children last year, hoping to show prison bosses she has changed and deserves a second chance. It is her hope that by showing she is in a stable relationship parole chiefs will see she is changed, see she has somewhere already set up to go and start a new le and she should be able to keep out of trouble, the insider said. “Who knowsthey will buy it ” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains most viewed homes far","story":"NewsBritains most-viewed homes so far this year revealed - and one costs £mRightmove has revealed the top five most-viewed properties on their site in  so farShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  FEB NewsBritains most-viewed homes in  have been revealed - including this mansion in Surrey \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritains most-viewed homes so far this year have been revealed - and one costs an impressive pound.m.

Closer to home, Tanya’s stepdad is showing similar resolve as he, too, faces the same issues. Tanya, who plays Rainie Cross in the BBC soap, said: “I have a family member who has Alzheimer’s. We’re dealing with that. “My stepfather will be in my sights, so will Barbara. “It’s a severely underfunded disease. We don’t know enough about it. The awareness has leapt this year and that’s got a lot to do with Barbara.” Scott Mitchell,  – hubby of TV’s much-loved Barbara,  – is also running the marathon.  And he and Tanya will be joined by a right collection of Cockneys in the form of EastEnders stars Adam Woodyatt, Jake Wood, Emma Barton, Natalie Cassidy, Kellie Shirley, Jamie Borthwick and Jane Slaughter. Training for the event has kept Tanya occupied while not playing TV’s Rainie. She and her character could barely be more dferent. Rainie is a former druggie and Tanya is teetotal and enjoys a quiet le with her partner James Barriscale in Kent. Her powerful performances as Rainie have touched families who have been ravaged by addiction. “Somebody recently came up to me in the street and said a family member of theirs had been going through a similar situation,” she told.  “As a family they’ve clocked into Rainie and over the years she’s been a formative character for them. Particularly when she was going through the crack addiction. Their family member was going through the same thing and they would watch Rainie. We have a social responsibility to tell the stories.” Tanya first set foot in Albert Square more than  years ago and loves every minute. The London-born star – who was seen last week at the West End version of Only Fools And Horses – had a special word to say about another EastEnders veteran, -year-old June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Tanya said: “June is wonderful. She’s still playing that iconic character. She comes on set with all the same ethics she’s ever had. Her integrity towards the work is absolutely paramount. She’s an inspiration to me and it’s an honour to work with her.” And Tanya also heaped praise on another inspirational actress – Olivia Colman, , who played Queen Anne in The Favourite and is up for the best actress award at tonight’s Oscars. The pair starred in Broadchurch together.   Tanya said: “I watched the filmwhen I was in LA. She’s amazing in it. I was mesmerised by her. I sent her a message straight after. “She’s not a showbiz person. She’s down to earth and fantastic at her job. It’s fantastic she’s being recognised. It’s encouraging as it reminds you it’s possible and that dreams do come true.” But Tanya doesn’t have any visions of Hollywood stardom herself. She added: “Rainie challenges me right across the gamut. There’s drama and comedy. I’m learning from her. If Rainie keeps challenging me like this I’m happy to stay.”To support the Barbaras Revolutionairies Alzheimers London Marathon team, click here .Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at webcelebs@trinitymirror or call us direct   .

The Scottish Terrier is a great breed for those who want a small companion dog with plenty of character and an independent streak, and have time to train them consistently.

She lives in Alfreton, Derbyshire, with her husband, Arnold.As my sister Jessie and I walked into the scout hut in , we weren’t sure what to expect. The whole concept of a slimming group was new. With a friend’s wedding approaching, both of us were feeling frumpy and thought it was worth finding out more. We’d already tried to lose weight by ourselves, without much luck. So we joined the room full of people, feeling slightly nervous.  But as I listened to our welcoming consultant Margaret explain her slimming philosophy, I started to think my two shillings and sixpence weekly fee — around p in today’s money — was going to be a good investment. Going to group became a real highlight of my week, with lots of friends laughing together. And we soon started losing weight.  We learnt a lot about food and how to fill up on the ingredients best for weight loss. I lost st, felt full of confidence at the wedding, and took up Margaret’s offer to take over a group. Inspiring people to discover their confidence for  years has given me so much pleasure.Betty is ft in tall and weighs st lb, having lost st at founder Margaret Miles-Bramwell’s original group in   sMy group has been my rock Lynne Asquith, , is also a Slimming World consultant. She lives in Batley, West Yorkshire, with her husband, Kevin. Are you sure you can have that  my husband asked, looking at my Chinese takeaway. I nodded, smiling. My greatest worry on joining was I might have to give up our weekend takeaway, but I didn’t need to. Before I joined, for three weeks, I’d driven to the venue, parked up, then driven home again. Once I finally got inside, experienced the atmosphere and found the plan would fit with our family tradition, I wished I’d gone sooner. It took me six months to lose four stone in , encouraged by my group and mum, Margaret, who was always the first to hear about my weight loss.  I trained to be a consultant myself and, with mum looking out for me, I kept the weight off as I embarked on my new career. In , mum passed away suddenly at . Devastated, I sought comfort in food and by , I was st lb. I knew the last thing mum would have wanted was to see me unhappy, so I rejoined Slimming World as a member. With my group’s support, I reached my target in .

She lives in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, with her husband, Rob. I struggled to lose the weight I’d gained having my two children and ended up in oversized clothes. But I wanted to be an energetic mum, so in  I joined Slimming World with Rob’s support. In nine months of enjoying delicious, satisfying meals, I’d slimmed from st lb to st lb. Then I went through a devastating bout of depression. Trapped at home by my illness, I regained the six stone I’d lost and more. I developed fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over my body, and felt at my lowest ebb.  But in , Rob and I decided to start a new business — a vape shop. I wanted to lose weight so I could feel confident talking to the public. The thought of going back scared me — I was wrongly worried people would judge me for regaining the weight. But I’m so glad I did. Le couldn’t feel more dferent since losing st fraclb.

But as I left the hospital that day in , I was determined to prove him wrong. I’d heard losing weight might improve my chances — and my mum, Lesley, already with Slimming World, gave me lots of encouragement. With her on my side and the support of my fantastic group, I lost st in nine months. In September , I started to feel a little queasy, although my husband Neil and I didn’t dare to hope. But after six positive pregnancy tests we finally believed it. Chloe, came along, and four years later I gave birth to Jake. I call them my Slimming World babies as I’m convinced it was losing weight that brought them to me.  There were other changes too. I dropped five dress sizes, going from a  to a , and after years of being self-conscious, my confidence grew. Neil has also lost st by enjoying tasty meals with me and the kids.

It was just after New Year  and my Instagram feed was full of reminders of how much bigger I was than my older brothers.They’d always been slim. I was born with one leg longer than the other, and childhood surgery to correct it didn’t quite work. The next operation at , was more successful. But it meant three months in bed, followed by three months of taking it easy, and my weight crept up. Bigger than I’d ever been, I reckoned Slimming World was worth a try.  I wasn’t sure a young ld like me would fit in, but I quickly felt at home and found inspiration surrounded by other people who all had the same goal. Since losing over six stone, I feel % better.

At  stone, three pounds, he is more than twice the average weight for his age after scoffing mountains of junk food. Now his mum is begging doctors to give him a pound, NHS gastric bypass. That is because Donna — who herself once weighed  stone — had the same operation last year. The -year-old ambulance worker said the procedure helped her to shed st and she now weighs less than her son. “People might criticise me for wanting to put my child through major surgery but I know from my own experience that it will change his le,” she said. During the procedure, the top part of the stomach is joined to the small intestine, so you feel fuller soon and you don’t absorb as many calories through food.   Ben, who is ft in tall, is bullied over his weight and lacks the willpower to diet. He said: “The bullying makes me feel bad. I want a gastric bypass like my mum. “Even though it would take a while to recover, I think it would be worth it and I could go on my bike with my friends.” Donna, from Havant, Hants, said: “I’ve broken down in tears in the doctor’s surgery because he really needs help. “A gastric bypass is major surgery but will be worth it. “Willpower is a big problem with Ben. He’s asked for slimming shakes but they’ll leave him hungry and he’ll give up. “If I could turn back time, I wouldn’t have let him eat so much junk. “I always apologise to him for letting him become the way he is as I blame myself.   “I’ve tried to push him into rugby and football but he would rather come home and play the Xbox.” Ben ate normally until he was four when Donna split with his dad and he started to have tantrumsshe didn’t ply him with chips, pasta and biscuits. “He would lob the plate across the roomhe didn’t like what was on there,” she said. “He was a chicken nugget machine. I would only give him about four at first. As he got older, his appetite would increase and he was always saying he was hungry. “I tried giving him smaller portions but half an hour later, he’d be raiding the cupboards for biscuits. I do wish I hadn’t given in now.”   She added: “I’ve been told I need to cut things down and be strict with him but he has behavioural issues and I need a house left standing. “I can’t constantly be decorating because he is lobbing a plate across the room. “He has all the signs of ADHD including poor concentration but he’s never been diagnosed. “I’m always being told it’s a parenting issue. I ask myselfI’m a bad parent. But I always come down on him like a ton of bricks over right and wrong.” Bullies teased Ben when they saw his mum at the school gates. Donna explained: “Ben was coming home upset as he was being taunted. People would say, ‘You are getting as fat as your mum’.   “It would destroy me. Some nights, I’d sit here in tears but I would use food as a comfort and he picked up on it. She could munch her way through  bags of crisps after a huge helping of pasta and chips. “I would watch telly nibbling crisps to try to make myself feel happier and he’d say, ‘You do it mum, why can’t I ’” Donna was  stone by the time she was  — and being bullied made her eat more. She said: “I was always called ‘fat cow’ walking down the road, and told boys would never have me because I’m fat. “I was terrible for eating in secret. I’d stuff my face silly at mates’ houses so my mum wouldn’t know.” At , when she fell pregnant with Ben, she was so heavy her st scales couldn’t hold her weight. Donna tried the Atkins Diet, which saw her shed st, but doctors warned it was affecting her kidneys.   She said: “I starved myself for a week once because I was so sick of Ben being bullied but I had no energy and I was no good for him. Stuck at st, she asked seven doctors to refer her for a gastric bypass before she was finally accepted last April. The op has left her feeling “ecstatic”. “I woke up from the operation and, for the first time ever, I had no interest in food,” she said. “The weight started falling off. People I’ve known for years don’t recognise me in the street. “Now, I’m stuffedI eat a Weetabix so I know it would be a godsend for Ben. I’ve been asking doctors to give him the operation for two years. “I don’t want him getting diabetes, or heart disease. But most of all I just don’t want him to have the miserable le I had for years.” Ben wants to join the police or the army when he leaves school and Donna believes the op would encourage him to be more active. She said: “He can’t join the police or the armyhe can’t run. “If I can get him down weight wise, he will enjoy sport more and won’t have kids taking the mickey and running round the pitch like a lump of lard. “I still give him treats, like a bag of popcorn on a Friday night, but I ration them.”   On a typical day, Ben’s breakfast is Weetabix, toast and scrambled eggs. Lunch is a ham sandwich and dinner spaghetti bolognese or pasta bake with chips. He no longer snacks through ten biscuits, a bowl of ice cream and a big bag of microwave popcorn each day. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the NHS gave children weight loss surgery onlytheir conditions were le threatening. “The child’s mum has done very well to lose this weight but it is not a good idea for the child to have bariatric surgery,” he said. “A child is still growing andyou have a gastric bypass you are severely limiting the food which that child needs in order to grow. “People might say it’s better to be thin and small but the body should be allowed to grow to its full, natural size. “The mother should hang off for a few years, all the time doing her utmost to keep him off the junk food he has been eating. “He will also need psychiatric counselling because the child has eaten too much fast food all of his le and will have a yearning to continue after a gastric bypass. “That will be ruinous because it might upset the bypass. He is not of an age to appreciate how crucial it is that he should amend his lestyle. “It’s less likely he’ll have the mental capacity to moderate his eating practices.”   Kids getting fat busting surgery at  Obese children as young as  are undergoing weight-loss surgery on the NHS.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: “There are children who are so fat that when they go to bed they roll over and lie on their airways and suffocate. “It is obese kids with le-threatening conditions like this who are having bariatric surgery. “Normally children of that age will not be given bariatric surgery because they are still growing.

School teacher Cindy Biddle underwent major surgery to remove the skin cancer which was lodged inside her nose. Although the surgeons were able to remove the danger, they had to remove part of the -year-olds nostril and rebuild it using skin from her forehead. The reconstruction left her with huge swelling disfiguring her face while it healed, but Cindy. from Florida, said she refused to let people stare. My scars were pretty jarring, but there’s no way I was going to hide away. “If I caught anyone giving me an unwarranted stare, I told it to them straight, she said.   One time, I turned around on a group of guys walking behind me and they jumped back with a look of disgust. It reduced me to tears, and when I saw them again the day after, they were all laughing. “This time, I kept my cool and told them: ‘Don’t act like jerks. It’s obvious I’ve had surgery.’ “They turned tail and ran.” Today the teachers scars are almost totally healed, but she - and doctors - almost missed the cancer entirely.   The only visible sign of the tumour growing inside her face was a tiny sore, which looked just like a spot that would not heal. Cindy tried picking at it and moisturising, and was even prescribed an antibiotic cream by her doctor, but it would not get better. It was only identied as basal cell carcinoma - a skin cancer is mostly caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays from the sun - by accident.The history teacher had gone to a walk-in clinic because she had a bad migraine , when the new doctor spotted the spot on her nose and immediately referred to a specialist. Cindy said she had no idea spending too much time outdoors could have given her cancer. I’d been working as a bar tender at a local Mexican place and had spent a fair amount of time in the sun and on the beach. “Growing up, no one gave a second thought to sun protection and I spent a lot of my childhood outside in the sunshine. “I was told the cancer had probably been growing for decades, possibly since I was  years old.” When she did go under the kne to remove the tumour, her husband Jonathan had to leave the room he was so shocked by the size of the growth.   Doctors then stretched her cheek skin to cover the hole and built her a new left nostril with skin from her forehead. Despite her shocking new appearance, Cindy said there was no alternative. This was something I had to do, because otherwise the cancer was literally going to eat my face off. I could have lost an eye or my entire nose.” She charted her recovery from the surgery with photos as the swelling gradually went down and her face ed to normal. Today, she is focusing on spreading the word about the danger of skin cancer and importance of protecting skin. I’ve only been to the beach once since my op and I was very nervous, sitting under an umbrella the whole time. “I wear factor  sunscreen every day now - evenit’s pouring with rain - and I always wear a hat outside. “A lot of my friends have stopped lying around on tanning beds. I have to say - take a look at the pictures. They would certainly stop me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bargain laundry eggs wash your","story":"NewsBargain laundry eggs will wash your clothes for £ a year - with no detergentThe genius new product can save you a lot of money AND the environmentShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBelieve it or not, theres some exciting news in laundry land...

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potholes-20000-craters-rack-up-more-than-1m-in-repairs-in-2018","story":"MORE than pound, was paid out to Glasgow drivers for damage caused by potholes last year, new figures show."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"new-13m-plan-to-fix-more-glasgow-potholes-first-time","story":"MORE potholes will be fixed first time under a new repairs investment plan by Glasgow City Council."},{"url":null,"title":"james-mcfadden-scotlands-hopes-on-our-wide-men-as-we-start-euro-campaign","story":"HE was known as a wide man himself once.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

It is the time of Lent: the old Germanic word for spring-time. Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week. The poems have been chosen are in a beautul book, entitled The Heart’s Time, by Janet Morley. The poems come from across the English-speaking world, over the last four centuries. One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishoners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

FreshAyr, the team behind the project, are not new to opening ‘pop-up’ spaces in the town. But boss Robert Singer, , insists: “We believe this next phase is potentially our most important. “Ayr has lost its place as a market town and tourist destination. “Long gone are the factories, fisheries and agricultural markets of the past – even retail is failing. “So there is a serious pressing need to rethink the way people engage with High Streets. “Our project will focus on the arts and use it as a force for regeneration.” The team have won a three month ‘proof of cause’ deal which, they hope, will lead in turn to later funding.   Robert explained: “We have a five year project in mind with this unit ideally being our permanent base. “Until now, we have operated around the town on a pop-up basis but that is never ideal. “We’d like this as our home.” The ‘BREAD arts lab’ will launch next month and run in conjunction with the project’s bakehouse, which is set to operate from Cathcart Street. Robert said: “We want people to engage with the process...to come in and literally see bread being made before their eyes before taking it home. “At our High Street base we will stage exhibitions, performances, music and art. “We want this to be a centre for everything creative.” •What is your view  Send us your opinion by email on news@ayrshirepost or give us a call on  .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"go-see-indigo-velvet-before-they-explode","story":"HOW many times have you been told to go see a certain band before they make it big And a year later everyones forgotten all about them...Well, for once the advice is pretty rock solid.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

Cockenzie Power Station site last March after the land was bought by East Lothian Council.Now, Scottish Conservatives are demanding the findings of the investigation be made public after they were sent to Ministers in private.South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne said the decision, which came after months of public hearings and representation, ldquobeggars belief, while ward councillor Lachlan Bruce said people were left wondering what the Scottish Government was doing ldquobehind closed doors.East Lothian Labour MSP Iain Gray has already tabled a motion at the Scottish Parliament demanding a public update on the decision as offshore windfarm company Inch Cape, which put in the planning application to build the substation, begins eight weeks of ldquoinvestigative work there.And East Lothian Council has said it is also considering writing to the Scottish Government, adding: ldquoThe council believes it is important for there to be transparency in the decision-making process.The decision on the application by Inch Cape, which is owned by Chinese state-owned company Red Rock, was taken away from council planners as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China last March.Inch Capersquos plans to bring energy from an offshore windfarm onto land at Cockenzie have been criticised by the council and communities for potentially sterilising a large area of land which has the potential to bring over , jobs to the county.The Scottish Government reporter scrutinised hundreds of documents from all sides and oversaw a public hearing in Cockenzie late last year.Her findings have been passed to Scottish Minister but are not being made public at this stage.The Scottish Government said: ldquoAn independent planning reporter was appointed to consider this case, produce a report and make recommendations in order for the final decision to be taken by Scottish Ministers.ldquoThe reporter has submitted her report and recommendations on the proposal and a decision will be made in due course.A council spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand that the reporterrsquos findings are now with Scottish Ministers, who will now determine the Inch Cape planning application, and that the contents of the report will be made public when that decision is announced.ldquoThe council believes it is important for there to be transparency in the decision-making process. We are considering possible correspondence with the Scottish Government on this matter. The leader of the council has also indicated that he will be writing to express similar concern to the minister.Mr Gray said the decision on the future of the site should never have been taken away from the council in the first place. He said: ldquoIt is of such great importance to the communities affected and the whole of East Lothian that it should have been determined by East Lothian Council and local people.ldquoThe community needs to know what is happening and what the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision will be, which is why I have tabled a question in Parliament asking Ministers to provide an urgent update.Conservative councillor Mr Bruce said: ldquoThe Scottish Government denied the local authorityrsquos right to make a decision on this application in the first place, making the whole process unfair and open to proper local scrutiny.ldquoThe fact that the report still hasnrsquot been released continues to shroud this whole saga in mystery and will leave many local people wondering what the Scottish Government is doing behind closed doors.And MsBallantyne added:ldquoItrsquos incumbent on the Scottish Government to be open and transparent over their decision-making process.ldquoDuring the formation of the report, the public engaged heavily by taking part in public hearings and contributing towards the report.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year!

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  Gateway to Scotland  The best Charles Rennie Mackintosh within 90 minutes","story":"The striking beauty and modernity of the work was not fully appreciated in his letime, though the vision of its ambitious creator is now recognised and celebrated around the world.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-reviews-locarno-in-glasgow","story":"WErsquoVE decided to have one farinaceous main course at Locarno to keep down the total cost because the other mains are so expensive: pound. to pound..

Even the number of priests who have resigned the ministry, or those who have requested dispensation for clerical celibacy, those numbers are not forthcoming from the Vatican.\"That would help with the conversation about whether celibacy is working for the majority of Catholic priests.

How can you keep the lid on that reality which the church doesnrsquot accept or condone  That is why this control of the celibacy rule for priests is key.\"Mr Walker explained that another reason why many priests may want to keep the fact they have children a secret is because many are ill-equipped to deal with secular le.He said: \"When I left the ministry I had something like pound in my bank account. You are in a situation where you are frozen by fear [at the thought of] leaving to start a new le in the secular world.\"Priests are worried about security. Nine times out of  they wonrsquot have any money behind them unless theyrsquove been left a legacy from their parents, or perhaps parishioners.

Instead, weeks of mild winter weather have taken a toll, creating confusion that has seen some plants burst into le and blossom weeks earlier than normal.ldquoLots of flowers, including some of the gardenrsquos camellia, are in full flower already, he says. ldquoThatrsquos a lot earlier than normal.One iety in particular, Mary Christian, with rich, glossy, dark green foliage and flowers of dazzling bright pink petals that hug a bouquet of delicate yellow stamen, has erupted in colour several weeks earlier than normal.ldquoItrsquos in full flower at the moment and normally that wouldnrsquot happen [for a few weeks yet], adds Baines.An early spring seemed on the cards as far back as mid-December when he spotted the first snowdrops carpeting the gardenrsquos woodland area ndash nearly two weeks earlier than expected.Throughout winter, the temperature at Logan hasnrsquot dipped below -.#c. Apart from a couple of stormy days which claimed a handful of victims, therersquos been little to send Loganrsquos exotic residents into a terribly deep sleep.ldquoI walked the garden over Christmas and counted  dferent plants in flower, Baines says. ldquoThey are definitely ahead of where they should be.ldquoOne member of staff has been here for over  years and remembers lsquoproperrsquo winters, when the whole place used to be cold and covered in frost.ldquoBut now we can grow plants which are fairly tender and can take just a little frost and they are doing fine outside.For gardeners across Scotland keeping watch for the first tentative green sprout of a crocus or bluebell, this subtle sht is not great news.A mild winter and early spring play havoc with the natural cycle of garden insects. Ladybirds may emerge from hibernation early and ready to feast on aphids only to find the cupboard bare, while a sudden cold snap could be disastrous for fragile flora.ldquoThere can be opportunity, adds Baines. ldquoMilder winters mean we can grow a wider range of plants. But the opposite is that in the last two decades you have probably had more pests and disease entering the world of horticulture than in the last two centuries.ldquoSudden oak death is pretty prominent, and one or two pests are much more prevalent because of the mild conditions.Itrsquos a clear sign ndashany were needed ndash of the battle faced by the natural world, one element of which was highlighted earlier this month when scientists warned that a global scientic review of insects had indicated they could become extinct within a century.The study, by University of Sydney, found % of all insect species are in decline.

When one part of the ecosystem falls down, therersquos a knock-on effect.But eveneverything in the global garden isnrsquot terribly rosy, therersquos much at Logan ndash one of four botanical gardens across Scotland that come under the umbrella of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh ndash that is, at least, blooming.Last year, more than , visitors made the journey to the Rhins of Galloway on Scotlandrsquos southwestern tip ndash closer, as the crow flies, to the Isle of Man than it is to Glasgow, and further south than Newcastle.There they breathed in the scent from more than  species of New Zealand and Australian eucalyptus at the gardenrsquos Tasmanian Creek, marvelled at -year-old tree ferns that tower four metres tall, and the curious ldquofilo pastry tree, Polylepis australis, which sheds layers of its bark in a bid to capture warm air and protect itself from the cool breezes of its native Andes mountains.In spring and summer, the mountain rhododendrons compete for attention with exotic blooms from the Canary Islands, Australia, South Africa and Chile the  species of palms ndash some over  years old ndash evoke beach le in sunny climes rather than the southwestern tip of Scotland.There are more than  species of wild flora ndash foxgloves, irises and wild grasses ndash carpeting the ground, lilies thrive on the walled gardenrsquos pond and the carbon-neutral Victorian-style greenhouse contains South American gems rarely seen in the UK.Where  could you find a driveway stretching a quarter-of-a-mile thatrsquos lined with  cabbage plants ldquoPeople are blown away by the exoticness of the place, itrsquos like an island with sea on both sides, says Baines, who was so enchanted by Logan as a child that he went on to study horticulture and follow in the footsteps of famous plant explorers like George Forrest, trekking to foreign lands in search of rare specimens.Later this year, Logan will be the focus for a series of celebrations to mark  years since it was handed to the nation.Its roots stretch much further ndash the McDouall family was granted lands in the area by John Balliol in the late th century and built a castle. Destroyed in the th century, a small stump remains within Loganrsquos walled garden.Fascination with exotic plants erupted in the th century, fuelled by explorers who ventured around the world in search of unusual species. The McDouall familyrsquos fascination with what it found and its estatersquos mild climate were a perfect match.Soon the first eucalyptus trees in Scotland were planted in the grounds, and peat bogs dug into terraces to nurture primulas.The estate was gted to the nation in November  and passed to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

A good example is a rhododendron called Kanehirae from north Vietnam.\"We did a survey five years ago and found the plant at Logan was the only one left in world.\"We propagated it, and circulated it around other botanic gardens.ldquoItrsquos not possible to undo whatrsquos been done to its native habitat, he adds. ldquoBut we can use our expertise so itrsquos not the end."},{"url":null,"title":"catholic-church-faces-mounting-pressure-to-help-traumatised-scots-children-of-priests","story":"One organisation which is supporting Scots whose fathers are clerics says people are left scared and traumatised by their secretive upbringings, and feel as though the church is trying to pretend they donrsquot exist.Some have even had to sign confidentiality agreements to hide their paternal identities, according to Coping International, which advocates for children of priests.Children have also been sent to Scotland from Ireland and England as a way of keeping them hidden from parish communities which may find out about their parentage.The impact on those involved is severe and detrimental, according to campaigners, who describe their treatment and lack of acknowledgement as ldquoclerical abuse.The Catholic church in Scotland has admitted it has no idea how many Scottish priests, or those working in Scotland, have fathered children.A spokesman has also compared the situation to office workers having extramarital affairs, and said the church as an employer wouldnrsquot necessarily have to get involved.It comes after secret Vatican guidelines emerged this week for priests who father children, but the church has refused to release the documents or explain what advice they contained.Vincent Doyle, founder of support organisation Coping International, has blasted Scottish bishops for failing to get to grips with the scale of the issue, and said more needs to be done to support women and prieststhey find they are expecting a baby.Irish psychotherapist Doyle set up Coping International after he found out a priest he believed was his godfather was actually his biological dad. He said he is currently supporting several Scots between  and  whose fathers are priests, who, he said, have been left scarred by their covert parentage and are afraid to speak out.However, he stressed that the actual number of children, men and women across the globe whose fathers are Scottish priests, or who live in Scotland, is likely to be much higher.Sonflowers, a support group for women who have had relationships with priests, previously reported that it had been inundated with calls from Scottish women claiming they were having relationships with priests and in some cases were pregnant by them.The organisationrsquos founder said in  she had hoped to set up a specically Scottish group to deal with the influx of calls but faced opposition to even advertising her service in churches or bulletins across the country.Doyle said: ldquoWe are supporting eight Scottish people. Eight may seem like a small number to many, but for those eight people their lives have been hugely affected.ldquoThey have been hidden, they have had confidentiality agreements too. They are scared.ldquoWe have one Scottish woman we are working with who was fathered by an Irish priest. They moved to Scotland and hid her there and she has hidden ever since. She doesnrsquot know what to do or how to bring it up.ldquoThese people are terried. One guy I know has psychosis, hersquos on the verge of schizophrenia.ldquoWe have a lot of kids also from Ireland and England sent to Scotland, who were adopted but now through things like ancestry and DNA matching sites they are finding out their roots and what actually happened.ldquoThere are around  priests in Scotland at the minute, but how many men have been ordained in Scotland or how many Scottish men have been missionary priests over the last  years  That is where the real question is.ldquoWhen you take that into consideration,only % of those priests fathered children, yoursquore talking about a surprising number.ldquoOn a global level, we know about , children in this position and that is only the ones we know about, itrsquos a hugely conservative estimate.A Catholic church spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there was no evidence of ldquosignicant numbers of children fathered by priests in Scotland, and compared priests having relationships to an office worker having an extramarital affair with a colleague.He said in both scenarios, vows would have been broken but it would not necessarily be the responsibility of the employer to get involved.When pressed, he admitted the church had no idea of the numbers and he had only heard of one such case before, but insisted that Scottish bishops would support prieststhey came to them to ask for help.The spokesman said: ldquoIn the case of a priest who has fathered a child, it is not possible to rule out any possible responses to these situations.ldquoA decision to remain or leave the priesthood would be made on its merits in each case.ldquoThere are no central records of such cases and while the church would not necessarily be aware of them, there is no suggestion of signicant numbers in this country.He also said there had been several priests who had left the priesthood to pursue relationships, and in his view there was no stigma around the issue.He said: ldquoIf a priest was to say to his bishop that he had fathered a child and, whether he wanted help to leave the priesthood and set up as a father or to remain in the priesthood but be able to support the child, the church would do whatever they could to support either of those options.ldquoEvery year a number [of priests] leave to get married. One left from Glasgow last year, for example. In the past that would have been seen as much more scandalous and a stigma. The view now is that the church is grateful for the service that you have given.Doyle has criticised the remarks and called for the church in Scotland to take the lead in finding and supporting people fathered by priests, and to understand why many priests do not disclose they have children.He said: ldquoI absolutely condemn the use of that world lsquosignicantrsquo in any regard. This is clerical abuse. If there are only five or  children in Scotland, so what  Quantity never should come in to pastoral care.ldquoIn order for this issue to be addressed we have to do away with moralistic audacious statements and look at this practically and also empower the woman. If you empower the mother and say lsquoyou are far from alone, you donrsquot need to be afraidrsquo, it would help, instead of the woman being told they are the only person in Scotland who is in this situation, and they must keep quiet in order for the priest to be able to support them and not lose their job.ldquoI would go back to the Catholic bishops in Scotland and ask them what constitutes a signicant number. We are working with eight people ndash is that insignicant  I donrsquot know the full number of children of priests in Scotland, but neither do the bishops.ldquoThe Catholic church should be willing to bend over backwards for one child so this whole thing of lsquosignicancersquo is hugely disrespectful, harmful and what they are trying to do is make this inauthentic.ldquoThere are children of priests the same as there are children of plumbers, fishermen, hairdressers ... they are out there.ldquoAnd it is never going to stop.

The happiest times of my le coincided with having allotments. During one particular period, I wrote in the morning, tended my allotment in the afternoon, and sorted mail for the GPO in the evenings, back in the days when I could truly claim to be a man of letters.I was poor but as happy as Larry, whoever he is, and remembered that Karl Marx had pretty much described such a le under communism in his famous book, ldquoDas Allotments. A particularly pleasant memory is of spreading rotten seaweed on the soil and a blackbird being so transported with delight that, after scoffing his fill of wee microbes on the maritime manure, he came and sat and warbled on the toe of my boot as I lay back contented with my labours.Alas, every time it came time for cultivation, I had to abandon the plot, as I am one of those fellows who can never settle and is always moving on, usually with disastrous consequences.In my lectures to young people about le, I always tell them:.

Glasgow to MallaigProperly referred to as the West Highland Line, this beguiling stretch of rail is now better known to millennials as the Harry Potter Line thanks to the spectacular Glenfinnan Viaduct which the Hogwarts Express crosses in the blockbuster films. As the train chugs its way northwest from Glasgow there are glimpses of Ben Nevis, Loch Shiel and Loch Eilt, and you may even catch sight of the isles of Rum, Eigg, Muck and Canna.The line crosses desolate Rannoch Moor and passes through Corrour, the highest mainline station in the UK, but it also serves coastal Arisaig, where anyone disembarking can enjoy some of the whitest sands in the world.The entire line is regularly voted one of the most scenic on the planet so itrsquos already deserving of its place in the Cool List, butyou want to go the whole Hogwarts then hop on board The Jacobite, the steam-hauled train which runs between Fort William and Mallaig. Leadhills to WanlockheadIf geographical trivia is your specialist subject at the local pub quiz then you donrsquot need telling that Wanlockhead is Scotlandrsquos highest village or that itrsquos located not in the Highlands but in the Lowther Hills in Dumfries and Gallowayrsquos Southern Uplands. If all that comes as news to you and you fancy a visit, donrsquot miss this treat. The railway is a narrow gauge and runs along the track bed of what was once a branch line on the Caledonian Railway to Wanlockhead from nearby Elvanfoot.It closed in  and shortly afterwards the lead mines it served were mothballed, so now the railway mostly pulls tourists along the kilometre or so between the two villages. Naturally, Wanlockhead also boasts Scotlandrsquos highest pub, the perfect place to read Robert Burnsrsquos poem Pegasus At Wanlockhead, written over a dram in another local hostelry as he waited for the horse of that name to have a shoe tended to by the village blacksmith. Inverness to WickKnown as the Far North Line for obvious reasons, this four-and-a-half-hour, -mile journey sees the train follow the coast for much of the way. Among the stops is one practically at the gates of the magnicent Dunrobin Castle, completed in the s at the behest of the owner who quite fancied having his own railway line. It required the say-so of Parliament but given that the owner was the Duke of Sutherland, the permissions werenrsquot too hard to get.Other highlights include Skibo Castle, Foulis Castle, the atmospheric peat bogsand the distilleries of Teaninich, Dalmore, Balblair, Whyte  Mackay , Glenmorangie , and, in Wick itself, Pulteney . Inverness to Kyle of LochalshIf yoursquore heading for Skye from the capital of the Highlands, then the so-called Kyle Line is the only way to travel. The line runs along the Beauly Firth, through Dingwall and on past villages such as Achnashellach, Achnasheen, Lochcarron and picturesque Plockton, where much-loved BBC drama Hamish Macbeth was filmed. Naturally there are great views of Skye itself at the end of the line but along the way yoursquoll also see the Torridon Peaks, Ben Wyvis, Loch Luichart and Loch Carron as well as some rugged Highland scenery. Aviemore to BroomhillThe route isnrsquot so much the treat here as the train itself because itrsquos on these  miles of restored track from the original Highland Railway Line that the Strathspey Steam Railway has run since it was brought back to le by a group of enthusiasts in . It runs between Aviemore stationrsquos  three and Broomhillrsquos Glenbogle station via Boat of Garten and when yoursquore not looking out of the window at the sceneryyoursquoll be looking around the old-style carriages or even down at your plate ndash the service offers all manner of dining experiences, from light lunches and afternoon teas to formal evening meals. Dufftown to KeithThis -mile line links the Moray towns of Keith and Dufftown, the self-styled ldquoWhisky Capital of the World . Predictably the line itself, once part of the Aberdeen to Elgin line, is known now as the Whisky Line and also bills itself the UKrsquos most northerly ldquoheritage railway. The rolling stock includes old commuter carriages from the s and s, and a dining coach which used to be part of the British Rail InterCity stock, but which has been repainted and renamed Spirit Of Dufftown. The line is closed for the winter and reopens on April . Borsquoness to Manuel JunctionOne of Scotlandrsquos most popular heritage railways, the Borsquoness and Kinneil Railway runs five miles between Borsquoness near Falkirk and Manuel Junction, via Kinneil and Birkhill. The views are pretty enough but again itrsquos the rolling stock which is the star.Among the favourites are  Neilson Reid locomotive Lord Roberts, which has been painted Thomas The Tank Engine blue, a set of s coaches in whatrsquos known as a ldquoblood and custard livery, and a pair of Caledonian coaches built in . Borsquoness is also home to the Museum of Scottish Railways, which houses historic locomotives, carriages, cranes, wagonsas well as shunting units, motorised trolleys and all manner of objects and archive stuff. Edinburgh to TweedbankThe Borders line, closed in  as part of the infamous Beeching cuts, reopened with no little fanfare in September  and reconnected the capital with the Borders towns of Galashiels and Melroseas well as Midlothian towns such as Dalkeith, Newtongrange and Gorebridge. The scenery is pleasant enough ndash go to the Highlandsyou want mountains and lochs ndash but the appeal of the Borders Railway, as itrsquos now known, lies in its ality and its historical importance: its rebirth brought a new dynamism and opportunity to a part of the country too often overlooked, and signicant numbers of tourists as well. Book lovers in particular have good reason to take the trip.

It was even used by ill-fated Russian tsar Nicholas II when he visited in .The original Crathes Castle station was built initially for the private use of the Laird of Crathes, and only later was the public allowed to use it. The Milton of Crathes station features a Victorian building but it came originally from Oldmeldrum and was sold to the Royal Deeside Railway for pound then transported to its new home in carefully labelled sections.The line has both steam- and diesel-hauled trains and among the former is the Thomas The Tank Engine-style Salmon.

Mackay ndash self-contained, confident and smartly dressed ndash may see himself as a steady pair of hands, but hersquod need the skill of a juggler to make everyone happy.At its heart, the Budget is redistributive ndash taking from the rich to provide services for the poor by widening the gap between how much higher earners pay in income tax in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Mackay has frozen the higher rate threshold at pound, in Scotland, while it will go up to pound, in the rest of the UK. However, everyone earning under pound, ndash % of taxpayers ndash will end up paying less income tax than in the rest of the UK.The spending plans also provide extra money for education , health , and infrastructure , and give new powers to councils to introduce a workplace car parking tax and a tourist tax. Local authorities get an extra poundm and can also increase council tax by up to .% rather than %.But what do the people who spend their lives studying the Scottish economy make of the Budget  Does the way Scotland spends its money work  Where could money be spent better  And what ideas might change the game when it comes to Scotland and out public services Some of the leading lights in Scottish public le give their views.PROFESSOR RONALD MACDONALDECONOMIST WITH THE ADAM SMITH BUSINESS SCHOOL AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITYRonnie MacDonald is happy to pay more tax, but he isnrsquot so happy with the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to balancing the books. ldquoThe focus seems to be too much on spending ndash there isnrsquot so much emphasis on growing the economy, he says.About half the revenue raised comes from taxes, he says, and our ldquoeconomy is very skewed towards oil ndash a commodity in price decline. ldquoItrsquos a dangerous strategy for the long-term sustainability of public spending, MacDonald says.With limited borrowing powers, the Government has a choice between \"growing the economy or spending less\". The Government is following a Nordic-style model of public spending, he says.However, ldquothese Nordic countries grew their economies before making spending changes, we seem to be doing it the other way around.ldquoI think wersquoll ultimately have to cut spending, he adds. ldquoYou either prioritise and have a leaner mix now, or yoursquore forced to do it in the future ndash you could face much worse cuts in the future.Higher taxes in Scotland ldquomay well put off foreign firms thinking of investing in Scotland, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom a US-based company thinking of Scotland or the north of England, Irsquom going to go where the tax regime is more favourable to my employees. All in all itrsquos quite a dangerous game theyrsquore playing.Macdonald suggests a ldquorealignment from spending ldquotowards lowering business rates to encourage growth.A more erse economy would grow more quickly, says MacDonald, and provide the money needed for the ldquopublic provision the SNP wants to offer. Manufacturing around le sciences and new technology is one way forward.MacDonald suggests Scotland should follow the path of Australia ndash currently blazing a trail with the solar production of renewable hydrogen as a green energy source. Renewable hydrogen, says MacDonald, can be stored and shipped in liquid form. Given Scotlandrsquos wind and waves, wersquod be in a perfect position to exploit the new technology in the era of climate change.ldquoIt could be revolutionary, MacDonald says. ldquoIt could be as important as the discovery of oil ... it could lead to the reindustrialisation of Scotland.If the Government used public money to invest in the new technology ldquoit could create a sovereign wealth fund as the Norwegians did to use oil to pay for services.DAVE MOXHAMSTUC DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARYldquoThe Budget is incredibly timid, says Moxham. ldquoWith the current ambition of a little bit more tax on middle- to higher-income earners, itrsquos quite impossible to fund the public services we need without the recognition that people on median and above incomes are going to have to pay more in taxation.\"We canrsquot pretend therersquos any mechanism for funding public services which doesnrsquot have that sort of ambition.ldquoItrsquos not enough to constantly use a Conservative Government as a comparator and say wersquore being slightly more progressive. Any party which aspires to say Scotland would be dferent under independence needs to be showing more now about what their commitment is to social justice.The STUC, says Moxham, would be ldquocomfortable with everyone above median income ndash about pound, ndash paying an extra penny in tax. ldquoThatrsquos small change. Itrsquos hardly bank-breaking, he adds.Spending needs to get smarter and more local too, Moxham says. Councils and council staff need more say in spending ndash as they understand the problems. ldquoTherersquos too much centralisation and not enough devolution to local authorities, he adds.He cites hospitals improving heart failure response times because ldquothe porters helped design the system of getting someone from the front steps to the operating theatre.ldquoWersquove had lots of reorganisation of the delivery of public services but these have tended to be executive-led, he says. Whatrsquos needed is getting the people who deliver the services ndash carers, nurses, teachers ndash to help design services. ldquoThe person who best knows how to organise a home care service is probably the home carer on the ground.The big idea that the STUC is investigating is a ldquouniversal basic infrastructure ndash where everyone has the guaranteed right to decent transport, housing, clinics and schools. Public spending priorities would be re-engineered around making sure every citizen had the basic infrastructure for a decent le.Small business bonus schemes are in the STUCrsquos sights. ldquoWe need a completely new approach to business tax giveaways, says Moxham. Investing in specic high-street regeneration schemes ldquois a far better way to rebuild our local high streets than the current approach where someone may need the boost, but others are using it to fund a second car.TRACY BLACKDIRECTOR OF CBI SCOTLANDIF the Government stimulates the white heat of technology it can fill its coffers with tax pounds and use the money to spend on the public services it wants ndash thatrsquos essentially Blackrsquos view.A no-deal Brexit could cost Scotland poundbn a year by , she says, and our demographics are going against us with a rapidly ageing population, so we need to start spending as smartly as we can. AI and automation could reduce costs. The elderly donrsquot have to travel to hospital when their blood pressure could be checked by remote monitoring. Investment in smart-ticketing and autonomous vehicles could help the high street.Glasgow may be a G hub, but connectivity needs improved across the country, as does infrastructure, Black says, so ldquowe get goods and people moving around more effectively.One big idea that Black is promoting is using national data to change how we spend public money. Data on the economy and population could be used by business ldquoto come up with really creative solutions around transport and health.The Scottish Government has done well so far supporting science and technology in business. Black says our pharma manufacturing sector is one of the most advanced in the world ndash itrsquos now the second-biggest spender on research and development, exports poundm in products, and has seen jobs rise by .%. The Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre in Renfrewshire was l funded by the Government and industry.Itrsquos this close working relationship between Government and industry that Black wants more of ndash but she feels there are ldquomixed messages when it comes to income tax, parking levies and the tourist tax. ldquoNone of these on their own are particularly crippling, but you put the whole package together and what sort of signal does that put out to inward investors PROFESSOR GRAEME ROYDIRECTOR OF THE FRASER OF ALLANDER INSTITUTE\"THE debate around public spending collapses down into short-term political sound bites rather than more intelligent conversations,\" says Roy. \"We see that every week at First Ministerrsquos Questions and in every manesto that every party produces.\"Parties obsess on issues like \", more nurses or , extra police officers\" when they should be looking at outcomes ndash like extending le expectancy or making streets safer. It may be that spending more money on housing rather than nurses will improve le expectancy. Preventative measures ndash that improve health or cut crime ndash will save money in the long run.\"Simple metrics donrsquot do anything for the long-term delivery of better value for public services,\" Roy says. \"Therersquos a fixation on targets and numbers when the evidence is that you should be bolder.\"He adds: \"If wersquore thinking about long-term sustainability of public services what we need to do is reduce demand, not just keep increasing supply.\"Such a quantum sht in how we look at public spending would require political courage. Politicians are locked in short election cycles, while long-term preventative policies might take decades to show fruit, Roy says. Closing a hospital because it makes more sense to spend the money on nutrition for the young could lose a government an election, even though  years from now it might have improved health.\"Some of the delivery of public services is simply not going to be sustainable in the long run,\" Roy says. \"Wersquove played with numbers where we think that on current projections NHS spending will within the next two or three years be pretty much % of the Scottish Budget. This will mean every other area in the public sector has to be squeezed ndash thatrsquos the sort of thing which I think will start to force more radical thoughts on how we deliver public services.\"JOHN DICKIEDIRECTOR, CHILD POVERTY ACTION GROUPDickie is clear that Scotlandrsquos public spending does not match the ambition of the Government when it comes to tackling child poverty. Targets have been set that less than % of children should be living in poverty by .With currently one in four Scots children in poverty ndash thatrsquos about , ndash to reach that target, says Dickie, \"we need a substantial rethink of how we raise revenue and allocate resources to make sure those families on the lowest incomes can give children a decent start in le\". Estimates show that one in three children could be in poverty within a few years.Dickie wants an \"income supplement\" to lt family finances to levels above the poverty line. The government is committed to introducing an income supplement by  ndash however, it hasnrsquot said how that will be delivered or how much it will be.The supplement needs brought in now, Dickie says. \"Families canrsquot wait until .\" He applauds policies like best start grants for families, and improvements in school clothing grants but says \"none of this is on the scale to have the kind of substantive long-term impact to really change the trajectory of child poverty\".Dickie would also like to see the Scottish Government act to top up child benefit by around pound, following cuts by the UK Government.Not tackling child poverty is a drain on the economy ndash with children more likely to get involved in crime, have poor health, and fewer job prospects. \"The government needs to act with urgency,\" Dickie says.

It changed the direction of his le.Hersquos got a slick command of his portfolio and can rattle off statistics at a dizzying rate ndash but his Budget is assailed from all sides: itrsquos either a hit on the middle classes or it isnrsquot doing enough for the poor.Criticism doesnrsquot faze Mackay though ndash only once does he falter, and even then momentarily, when asked why the SNP needed the Greens to push them in a more progressive direction over policies like the parking levy.In his eyes, the Budget is about stability in the face of ldquocalamity at Westminster sustainability of public services, and stimulus for the economy.Mackay says preventative measures are built in when it comes to public health and early years ndash and the economy of the future is being looked after in terms of innovation on data and infrastructure. Direct investment in Scotland is second only to London, and research and development is at record levels. He makes much of new figures showing unemployment is at an all-time low.However, therersquos only so much the Government can do given the limited range of powers granted to a devolved administration, he says. ldquoWe can grow the economy as an independent countrywe have control of levers like immigration policy, and over a wider basket of taxation powers.Mackay described his current Budget as ldquofair and progressive in that it takes ldquoa bit more from the highest earning section of society. In the next financial year, he says, ldquo% of taxpayers will pay less tax, not more, on their current incomes, and itrsquos only those on or above pound, who will pay more.Itrsquos a ldquobalanced and moderate approach, he thinks. ldquoWersquore building a social security system with a dferent philosophy around dignity and respect, he said, while claiming the UK Government was in a ldquorace to the bottom on tax.While Mackay attempts to create a more progressive Budget, he insists hersquos also trying to remain pro-business as he believes ldquothe best social policy is employment. He dismissed claims of ldquoclass war in his Budget.ldquoIf we donrsquot invest in society and have the necessary safeguards for all then everyone pays for societal failure ndash business and taxpayers pay for this with prisons and unemployment, he says, adding that he believes his Budget presents a ldquopretty good deal.Reformation of council tax is likely to dominate the political discussion soon with plans for cross-party talks to find an alternative. ldquoIf we can find the consensus that could adequately and safety replace it then wersquoll support that, Mackay says. Legislation could be prepared in this Parliament for implementation in the next.Come the end of this Parliament, the country will also be heading towards the time for a review of the ldquofiscal framework set out by the Smith Commission and Scotland Act, which will mean the Government can ask for more powers from Westminster.Mackay admits such an ask wonrsquot be easy as ldquoWestminster concedes nothing without challenge and pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-just-what-is-going-on-in-haiti","story":"THERE is nothing like a coup drsquoetat to bring out the headcase and the hedonist in people.When I first visited Haiti back in , aside from the countryrsquos legions of poor, it seemed almost entirely inhabited by these two species of inidual.The capital Port-au-Prince was in meltdown back then, the cityrsquos ramshackle streets a labyrinth of barricades and blazing tyres, looters, shooters and partygoers.President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in the process of being deposed from power. In the space of a few weeks, I would watch those same \"bouleds\" once consumed by violence and littered with corpses turn into one giant carnival as thousands crammed to dance the night away to Haitian and Caribbean music.Everywhere around the national palace that had been Aristidersquos lair of power, giant floats drted by while women in flamingo pink dresses, and voodoo priests, partied against the pure white backdrop of the whitewashed palace facade that dazzled in the nighttime dark like an edice of snow.There are few countries in the world that Irsquove been to quite like Haiti. Even fewer that have seen so much turmoil and destruction. It really does beggar belief that such a place exists an hour-and-a-halfrsquos flight from glittering Miami, and less than three hours from New York City. As the books and experts will attest to, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and the worldrsquos least developed outside of Africa ndash and believe me does it show.At night in the cityrsquos Marche en Fer or Iron Market district, crushing poverty forces sex workers, some little more than children, onto the filthy fire-lit streets.This is a two-tier nation that rises from the slums of Cite Soleil and Saint Martin, where hundreds of thousands cram into reclaimed swampland and cemeteries.So congested is it here that people I met said that ldquosht sleeping is common.With many single cupboard-sized rooms too small to house an entire family at any one time, people have been known to bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside.It might be a short distance as the crow flies in Port-au-Prince, but these teeming, humid slums are a world apart from the cool hills above where the wealthy live in the gated communities of Petionville, with their fine restaurants catering to a very dferent side of Haitian le.Right there in that very juxtaposition Haitirsquos inequality lies encapsulated. A chasm between haves and have-nots that for decades has led to political instability and violence which these past weeks has once again reared up and gripped the country.ldquoAfter each election, we are deeper and deeper in a crisis. People are living day-by-day ... If you donrsquot resolve the situation, yoursquoll have another uprising, warned Jean Clarens Renois, a former journalist and presidential candidate last week as street protests in the country intensied.For the last two weeks now, almost unnoticed by the international media, thousands of Haitians have taken to the streets, asking for US-backed president Jovenel Moise and his government to resign. Writing in the New York Times a few months ago, Jake Johnston, an international associate at the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and an expert on Haiti, told the story of what sparked the current round of unrest.ldquoIt started with a few keystrokes in a living room in Montreal, he wrote.ldquoGilbert Mirambeau Jr, a Haitian filmmaker and writer, took to Twitter on August  to post a photo of himself, blindfolded, holding a piece of cardboard with a simple question written on it in Haitirsquos Creole: ldquoKot Kob Petwo Karibe a    ndash Where is the Petrocaribe money   As Johnston went on to explain in the article, just a few days after Mirambeaursquos tweet, an informal group of young Haitians organised on social media using the hashtag #PetroCaribeChallenge and since then Haitians from all sectors of society have taken to the streets demanding an answer to Mirambeaursquos original question about what became of the Petrocaribe cash.This vast sum of over  billion is part of low-interest loans provided by Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil-purchasing alliance of Caribbean states that since  was aimed at helping Haitirsquos ailing economy. The funds became crucial emergency money to the country following the devastating earthquake of  that laid waste to swathes of Port-au-Prince and beyond.Since then, the missing cash and whole Petrocaribe affair has become a political cause celebre in a country where ordinary people have seen a % hike in fuel prices and double-digit inflation that has made day-to-day survival extremely challenging for more than % of the population.For decades, ordinary Haitians have felt themselves powerless when confronted with this ongoing legacy of corruption and misgovernment. Presented with few alternative options, iniably they take to the streets as a last resort when trying to change things for the better.With so many locked in the grip of protracted poverty their frustration with the countryrsquos level of corruption is understandable. To take but one example following the  earthquake, it became clear that despite foreign donors pledging more than  billion in aid, less than % of that emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians.I well recall in the wake of the earthquake talking to ordinary Haitians who had lost almost everything. One was a woman called Gladys Pierre, a mother who described that day back in  when just before five orsquoclock the mirrors fell from the walls in her family home and the furniture rose up and flew through the air asthrown by a giant malevolent poltergeist.ldquoA big beam slid, and from the chest up Rachelle was crushed against the wall like a mosquito, and I knew my little girl had died, Gladys told me, her voice trailing off.Unimaginable as the horror of her story was, it didnrsquot stop there. Steeling herself, she continued to tell of how her daughterrsquos semi-crushed skull became a grotesque prop for part of the apartment block wall that remained standing.In the following months, so dangerous were those ruins teetering on their macabre headstone that no-one dared enter to remove Rachellersquos corpse.Like many ordinary Haitians who found themselves now living in one of the tarpaulin cities that became semi-permanent fixtures in Port-au-Prince, Gladys and her husband Joel held out little hope of those in power doing much to improve their lives.ldquoYou only see them in their beautul cars and big jeeps driving up and down but they never stop, never get out of the car, talk to us or even congratulate the women and children on their courage, I recall Joel telling me at the time.And so, in the eyes of many Haitians, this sense of helplessness and frustration remains the way they see their lives and once again anger has boiled over in the country.While president Moise has pledged a crackdown on corruption few see little signs of it. Those who have taken to the streets as part of the protest movement in recent weeks have no clear political leader, but Haiti has a huge diaspora that has harnessed social media in its non-violent #PetroCaribeChallenge, campaigning among a population more than half of whom are under  years old.As ever, though, tensions have risen as government repression against the campaigners has become more unrestrained and brutal. Even in the early stages the signs of this were all too clear when last November armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least  people just days before protests were due to begin.All this time, US influence ndash official or unofficial ndash has never been far from the surface in Haiti. In the latest case of murky US interference, five heavily-armed Americans were arrested in Port-au-Prince last week along with a Haitian man and two Serbians.The Americans are former Navy Seal officers Christopher Michael Osman and Christopher Mark McKinley, and Marine veteran Kent Leland Kroeker, as well as Talon Ray Burton and Dustin Porte. Burton is a private investigator once employed by the controversial private security company formerly known as Blackwater and the State Departmentrsquos diplomatic security service. Inside their vehicles the Haitian police found six automatic rles, six pistols, two professional drones and three satellite phones, and they were also carrying sets of licence plates.ldquoThey said that they were here on a lsquogovernment mission,rsquo ldquo Miami Herald reporter Jacqueline Charles told US National Public Radio. ldquoThey did not specy which government, but then they did tell the police that ... their boss was going to call their boss.Whether they were mercenaries, ldquogovernment contractors of something , the arrest of the Americans while failing to make global headlines triggered wide speculation about why they were in Haiti, particularly among Moisersquos political foes.The possible explanations range from a desire to protect the central bank or foreign assets to potential attacks on anti-government demonstrators and leaders. According to the Haitian police, the men claimed they were on a ldquogovernment mission when they were pulled over about a block away from the nationrsquos central bank.The US government only subsequently intervened after Haitian prime minister Jean Henry Ceant, speaking on CNN, called the group ldquomercenaries and ldquoterrorists. That they were released from prison and immediately flown back to Miami where they faced no charges has only further fuelled the rumour mill and caused political uproar in Haiti.Pierre Esperance, executive director of the National Human Rights Defence Network in Haiti, blasted the decision by US authorities not to charge the men.ldquoWhat the Haitian government did is grave. It shows that they had something they were looking for. The fact that the US took these people and did not charge them, it shows there was a conspiracy. They didnrsquot want them to go before Haitian justice, he told the Miami Herald.On Friday, the protests on the streets of Port-au-Prince showed no signs of abating. ldquoToday we lock down the country again, opposition leader Schiller Louidor told people who gathered for a funeral of two protesters killed earlier in the week, before they marched on the national palace carrying one of the coffins. ldquoWe are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel Moise can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go, said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus.And so Haiti is mired in turmoil again and just what the future holds is anybodyrsquos guess. But the mysterious presence of armed Americans and the cancellation of this monthrsquos scheduled carnival in Port-au-Prince certainly bodes ill for this long-suffering nation born out of slavery and still consigned to poverty."},{"url":null,"title":"chuka-umunna-urges-voters-to-join-movement-for-different-kind-of-politics","story":"In a sign that The Independent Groupwill form a fully-fledged parliamentary party, the former Labour MP called for the public to ldquojoin us, and help us forge a new, dferent kind of politics for Britainrsquos future.Our political system is clearly completely broken.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us.

Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery. If that help was not there when I needed it, the outcome could have been very dferent.The other said: ldquoHearing a voice that was willing to listen to me was a relief on one of the darkest days of my le.Sunday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I.

But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses.

But, so far, not in this instance. Some have greeted their departure with a sense of triumphalism that they are “not Labour” or “should join the Tories”. Others have spent the last few years hounding, harassing and bullying those very MPs in order to force them to leave the Labour Party. I think they are all missing the point.I’m angry at that approach but I am angrier at the reaction from the Labour leadership. What we needed last Monday was a moment for reflection.The MPs who have resigned their lelong association with the Labour Party have taken this heartbreaking decision not as an act of sabotage or spite but as a very last resort at a situation they felt was untenable. They also set out a challenge to the Labour Party leadership. Those challenges should have been thought about and dealt with. But instead we got a cloth-eared response that essentially dismissed their concerns.I’ve never been involved in the professional world of human resources, but I am sure in any other organisation there would have been a little bit of soul searching to ensure no others would leave, and to try and address the fundamentally important reasons for their leaving in the first place.And the challenges they set are fundamental.They rightly said that the current official Labour Party position to prevent a public vote with the option to remain in the EU, which is the Labour Party policy agreed at our conference, was not in the national interest, and is playing members and the rest of the country for “fools”.They rightly said that the Labour Party was lack-lustre at best and turning a blind eye at worst to the scourge of anti-Semitism that seems to be enveloping the party.They said that the bullying and intimidation of MPs was unbearable and this was being tolerated by the Labour leadership’s inability or unwillingness to do anything about it. And they rightly said that the current Labour Party was only that in name and the party they joined was no longer the one they recognised today.There is little doubt that our politics is broken, and the party system is breaking down.Many voters see themselves as being politically homeless and that is why the new Independent Group should not just be dismissed.If they capture the imagination of the public, demonstrate that our politics is broken, develop policies for all of the country, and guide themselves by the national interest, they will talk to a very large number of voters. At the very least, they may well recalibrate British politics.So, the Labour Party is at a crossroads. The leadership can either see the events of this week as a wake-up call and try to address the issues that have been raised or they can carry on with business as usual. I would plead with them to go with the former, but I fear they have already set the trajectory for the latter.If they take the wrong route now the public will look for something that better reflects their hopes and aspirations for a credible alternative government to this wretched Tory administration and it won’t be anyone’s fault but their own.I have no plans to join them, but Tom Watson MP was correct when he said, “I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.”Those who have left have put the Labour Party on notice and I certainly don’t blame them for standing up for what they believe in. I just wish the Labour leadership would recognise the problem and listen, acknowledge, reflect, and reform.Ian Murray is Labour MP\u2028for Edinburgh South©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may delays meaningful vote again","story":"Theresa May has delayed a second vote on her Brexit deal, leaving it until as late as  March for MPs to decide whether to accept the agreement or put the UK on a path to a no-deal exit from the EU.The Prime Minister confirmed she would not put a deal before parliament in Brexit votes this week, sparking condemnation from opposition leaders and her own MPs and risking the resignation of ministers who have insisted Mrs May rule out a no-deal scenario.With MPs set to vote on a proposal to extend Article an agreement hasn’t been approved by mid-March, it also puts huge pressure on Brexiteers, who could face a decision between Mrs May’s deal and a delay to Brexit.Speaking on her way to an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Prime Minister said: “I was in Brussels last week. Ministers were in Brussels last week. My team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be ing to Brussels on Tuesday.“As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that happens by March .“But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March .”: Lib Dems shouldn’t backto EU after BrexitShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the decision was “the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure”.“Theresa May is recklessly running down the clock in a desperate attempt to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal,” Mr Starmer said. “Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the decision showed “Westminster is failing Scotland”.“Theresa May’s attempts to run down the clock on Brexit must be stopped – for the Tory party to gamble with the country’s future like this threatens a major economic catastrophe,” Mr Blackford said.The announcement was greeted with despair by business leaders, who backed a delay to Article .Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors said firms had “lost all faith in the political process”.“With today’s announcement, it’s clear the writing is on the wall. There appears to be little realistic chance of a deal being agreed and the necessary legislation getting through by  March,” he said.“It now seems hard to envisage an exit without a limited, technical extension to allow time for parliament to finalise our exit.“There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no deal.”There was also criticism from Remain-supporting Tories, with the MP Nick Boles saying there was “no reason to believe the PM will achieve anything in next two weeks that she hasn’t in last two months.”Focus will now turn to an amendment proposed by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin, which sets a deadline of  March for a deal to be agreed - one day before the cut-off set by the Prime Minister.: Independence orce negotiations ‘would be harder than Brexit’If the amendment is passed when MPs vote on a government ‘neutral motion’ on Wednesday, it would begin a process backed by legislation requiring the Prime Minister to ask the EU to delay Brexit.Mrs May now faces a major rebellion by pro-EU Tories who oppose a no-deal Brexit, potentially including some of her most senior ministers.Three cabinet ministers - Work and Pension Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and Justice Secretary David Gauke - warned on Saturday that unless a deal was agreed imminently, MP would be forced to back the Cooper-Letwin amendment.“It would be better to seek to extend Article  and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March ,” the ministers said.Responding to their comments on the flight to Egypt on Sunday, Mrs May insisted collective Cabinet responsibility had not broken down.“What we have seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “That is not a surprise to anybody.“We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.”Mrs May did not respond when askedthe three ministers should remain in government, but said extending Article  would not break the deadlock over Brexit.“Often people talk about the extension of Article  asthat will actually solve the issue. Of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.“Extension of Article  doesn’t solve the problem.“There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India.

Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker.

It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"eu cannot compromise on brexit deal to placate conservative brexiteers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AUTOCROP h bpanews_eb-e-c-abbe-acaa_EmailThe Government has defended the practice of culling deer in Dublin’s Phoenix Park..pushFinance Minister Paschal Donohoe ruled out contraceptives as an alternative to managing wild deer populations.Mr Donohoe’s comments come after animal rights groups criticised deer being shot dead in the capital’s park in January following orders by the Office of Public Works.A total of  deer were shot at the start of the year.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A deer cull is carried out in Phoenix Park in Dublin It is understood the carcasses were then sold onto meat suppliers.Campaigners called for a more humane way of managing the wild deer.In a written response to a question in the Dail by Independents  Change TD Clare Daly asking whether alternatives to deer culling in the park had been considered, Mr Donohoe said alternatives had been examined but they were not deemed feasible.“Deer culling is of course an activity that OPW would prefer not to have to carry out,” Mr Donohoe said.“However, the cull, as undertaken, is considered to be the most appropriate and humane way to sustainably manage the population of deer in the park.”Mr Donohoe said contraceptives were not a viable alternative because no contraceptives are licensed for use on wild deer in Ireland.“Although not licensed yet, there are dferent contraception strategies available for deer, but in most cases, they refer to heavily managed herds ,” he said.The minister said the most common strategy would be steroids, which are given to each female on a yearly basis, but he said administration of these steroids in the correct quantities would be “entirely impractical” in a large, wild herd as it would disrupt their normal herd behaviour.Such steroids would be administered via dart and Mr Donohoe said the darting of deer for capture to administer contraceptives would be an “extremely dangerous procedure” to undertake in a public park.“Darts are often lost during such operations resulting in a dangerous hazard to the public and other wildle,” he said.“The quantities of tranquilliser required to sedate a deer could be fatal for humans which is obviously of particular concern in a park frequented by large volumes of visitors.”Mr Donohoe also said live capture, which was carried out in  with over  persons involved from Ireland and the UK, was not an option as current health and safety requirements and the size of the current herd meant it was not practical or safe to undertake this exercise today.“Live capture takes hours to be completed.“Stress levels can reach abnormal levels in the animals leading to immune-depression and abortion in females,” he said.“Live capture requires the gathering of many deer in limited spacesand this can lead to severe or sometimes lethal injuries especially among fawns and younger deer injured by bucks.”He also ruled out transporting the deer to other locations as it would be very stressful for wild animals.The OPW has previously said that culling prevents a rise in the fallow deer population which can lead to an increase in road traffic accidents in the popular park.Phoenix Park was originally formed as a royal hunting park in the s and opened to the public in .The park is home to Dublin Zoo and the residence of the president of Ireland Michael D Higgins."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland

We called a referendum and let people express their views – so we should not be seeking to deselect any of our MPs because of their views on Brexit.“Our party is rightly a broad church – on that and other issues. And we will only save our country from the threat of Jeremy Corbynwe remain one.”On Wednesday, the Commons is expected to consider an amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin enabling the House to extend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no deal by mid-March.A similar amendment was defeated by MPs last month, but there is speculation that enough Tory rebels, alarmed that there is still no deal in place, could be prepared to back it this time round for it to pass.Downing Street has saidthere is no deal by Tuesday, the Prime Minister will at that point make another statement to the House and table an amendable motion to be debated and voted on the following day.However, it is unclear whether that will be enough to stave off a revolt by MPs alarmed at the prospect of no deal – including potential ministerial resignations."},{"url":null,"title":"japans emperor marks 30th year of reign at","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And he offered a global review of the broader societal problem of sexual tourism and online pornography, in a bid to contextualise what he said was once a taboo subject.But he said the sexual abuse of children becomes even more scandalous when it occurs in the Catholic Church, “for it is utterly incompatible with her moral authority and ethical credibility”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis celebrates Mass at the Vatican “We need to recognise with humility and courage that we stand face-to-face with the mystery of evil, which strikes most violently against the most vulnerable, for they are an image of Jesus,” he said.Francis summoned the bishops from around the world to the four-day meeting to impress upon them that clergy sex abuse and cover-ups are not just a problem in some countries but a global problem that threatens the very mission of the Catholic Church.“Brothers and sisters, today we find ourselves before a manestation of brazen, aggressive and destructive evil,” the pope said.He offered an eight-point pledge of priorities going forward, calling for a change in the church’s defensive mentality and a vow to never again cover-up cases. Victims, he said, must take centre stage while priests must undergo a continuing path of purity with the “holy fear of God” guiding the examination of their own failures.“In people’s justied anger, the church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted by these deceitful consecrated persons,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"relocation of us army base in japan gets put to public vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Four skin graft operations were carried out.ldquoIt took me about a week to learn to walk again because my back was very painful, he said. ldquoEven when I went back to school I had to learn to write again because my hand was badly burned and had to be practically rebuilt.ldquoI have been told that my burns will hurt again in the hot weather and they already go blue in the cold.ST JOHNrsquoS POINT mdash The industrialist behind the Government-backed De Lorean car may soon be buying a country retreat at St Johnrsquos Point, near Killough.Executive aides of John De Lorean, the man at the centre of the new car to be built in the province, are expected to look at a Georgian mini-mansion that a Belfast estate agents are selling on behalf of leading Ulster barrister Demond Boal.The property, set in five acres along the coast and with superb views of the Mourne Mountains, is one of the most plush and expensive homes in the province that the aides are likely to examine.Other quiet country retreats that resemble the style with which Mr De Lorean has been accustomed mdash all costing more than pound, mdash have come under the eye, but it is through that the St Johnrsquos Point property may get the vote.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Shocked Down councillors were told this week that the Housing Executive are impotent to deal with the housing waiting list in Ballynahinch, which may not get any new houses until .Executive officials admitted there is very little land available to them in the town and they face a losing battle with private developers for the few sites that come on the market.Mr Colin James, of the Executiversquos design team, told a meeting on Monday: ldquoThere is a waiting list of  in Ballynahinch and we feel impotent in our ability to deal with it. It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago.

It was indeed seen as a building block towards delivering Irish unity.“There is much for unionism to reflect on, particularly given that we have now come to a point where unionists are in the minority at Stormont.“Any right-thinking unionist should ponder long and hard as to why they would want to go back to that system of government.”South Down MLA Mr Wells said Mr Eastwood’s remarks were “the last throw of the dice” for the SDLP, which he described as a party “looking for relevance”.“These comments by Mr Eastwood are yet another nail in the coffin of the social democratic element of that party,” he told the News Letter.“We have known for years that Sinn Fein wanted to use Stormont as a means towards achieving a united Ireland, and it is sad that the SDLP have now seem to have joined that bandwagon.“It also indicates to me that the SDLP has thrown out any attempt to woo unionism. They are trying to out-green Sinn Fein.

Ministers were in Brussels last week. My team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be ing to Brussels on Tuesday.“As a result of that we won’t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week. But we will ensure that that happens by March .“But it is still within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on March .”Asked how the Government would treat non-binding motions expected this week which call for the ruling out of a no-deal exit, and which demand an extension of Article , Mrs May said: “We don’t know what amendments are going to be tabled.“We don’t know what amendments are going to be selected.“You haven’t even seen what motion the Government is going to put down - as I say, it won’t be the meaningful vote.“I will be making a statement to Parliament on Tuesday. And then, obviously, we’ll be having the debate the next day.”The PM said the Government was still in talks with the EU about the Northern Ireland backstop.Mrs May said: “We are still in that negotiation. We are still talking to the EU about ious ways in which we can find a resolution to the issue that Parliament raised.”The PM insisted collective Cabinet responsibility had not broken down after the intervention by Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke indicating that they could back parliamentary moves to stop a no deal.Loughinisland: Killers’ getaway car had no forensic value Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The PM said: “No, collective responsibility has not broken down.“What we have seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, and in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe.“That is not a surprise to anybody.“We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire, to actually ensure that we leave the European Union with a deal. That’s what we’re working for and that’s what I’m working for.”Askedthe three ministers should remain in Government, Mrs May said: “What we see around the Cabinet table is strong views held on the issue of Europe.”Mrs May said that extending Article  would not deal with the issues.The PM said: “Now, often people talk about the extension of Article  asthat will actually solve the issue. Of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point where we need to make that decision.“Extension of Article  doesn’t solve the problem.“There will always come a point where we have to decide whether we accept the deal that’s been negotiated or not.“And that will be a decision for every member of Parliament across the House.“Every member of the Commons will have to face that decision when that point comes.“The Government will be bringing back, working with the EU, and will want to put a deal to the House of Commons in a meaningful vote.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
